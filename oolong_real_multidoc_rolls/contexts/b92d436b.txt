[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Everyone, welcome to the new episode of Critical Role. This evening, we luckily have Ashley Johnson back in as her character Pike. Unfortunately, Laura Bailey will be gone for most of the game, possibly, she might come in, 'cause she's busy recording a show with Wil Wheaton. It's gonna be a great show, but we'll miss her, until she shows up. However, we shall see what the next chapter has in store in just a moment. In the meantime, let's go ahead and get you situated with the character backgrounds.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size. This barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two handed gray axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this, this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned, and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches. Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house, where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder clap) Under that unintimidating, petite frame is a vicious beast, waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. (giggles) Born to the air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation, and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. Anyways. It wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities, and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped, and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when or if she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise, and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest, and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river, and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well gird your loins ladies because he has his eyes on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troop, where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter a distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts, and makes the females swoon. (sputtering)
Orion: Greetings, and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Tirex, located in the heart of Draconia. Born from a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the sorcerer's right, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges in the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps, of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learn of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later I devised a ruse, and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands, in that respect. But it was exactly what I needed, so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that! (sputtering) I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy go lucky, and, well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax’ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capitol of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capitol didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night, and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journey back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roaring) With their ties all severed, Vax’ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (drawing blades) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father, who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax’ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance. And after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of a thief. While Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt, and to track, to spy, and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen trinket-- to fight along side her and protect her fiercely. Also he is adorable. And gives expert massages.
Travis: Right, listen up. If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this Barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (giggles), shiny things. But also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the wood--
Matt: Welcome back. Unfortunately, we don't have Pike's video ready yet. I'm working on it.
Ashley: My bad.
Matt: This week got away from me, and Ashley got it to me a little late, but we'll have it up next week, don't worry. However we are happy to have Ashley with us. (all cheer) She's come down from her BAFTA cloud. (all laugh) Which is amazing, congratulations again.
Ashley: Thank you guys.
Matt: So yeah, as a heads up too, if you wanna do any quick announcements real fast, I think you had an announcement you wanted to make.
Ashley: It's my mom's birthday today. (all cheer)
Matt: Happy birthday Ashley's mom, yay!
Ashley: Her name's Nancy.
Liam: Hi Nancy.
Travis: Happy birthday, Nancy. Totally watching this right now.
Marisha: Is she watching?
Ashley: She probably is. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, hello! Also for those who are Hearthstone players, the new Black Hawk Mountain Expansion came out today, in which I voice Nefarian and Ragnaros. (all cheer) My vanilla-WoW-playing self from back in the day is nerding out over that, so enjoy that. Anyone have anything else they wanna announce or talk about? Are we good to start?
Sam: Hi, mom!
Marisha: Hi, mom.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: I don't think my mom knows what the internet is.
Orion: Related, I leveled my undead holy priest to 64 last night, on Warcraft.
Zac: We're just about a thousand happy--
Matt: Congrats. Way to go, level 64. So you're just barely into burning crusade, good man. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I got one too. My brother who also works in video games gave a talk at GVC this year, and it just went online, and not now but later you should watch Alex Jaffe's talk on metagame balancing. It's really really fun, it's fabulous, and you learn a lot.
Matt: There you go, Alex Jaffe, look it up.
Marisha: Alex is brilliant.
Matt: All right guys, so, getting to the game at hand. So little overview for the story, the party has been sent to the city of Kraghammer, through a friend of theirs named Arcanist Allura Vysoren. A good friend of hers and a folk hero throughout the land known as Lady Kima of Vord, who's the halfling paladin of Bahamut, has gone missing. She went on a vision quest as part of a pilgrimage she's been on for the past year, and sensed a dark evil brewing far beneath the city of Kraghammer. Disappeared into the city and hasn't been seen for weeks. So Arcanist Allura asked the party, hired them essentially, to go and see her whereabouts. Upon getting to Kraghammer, they interacted with some of the local characters, eventually found theirself talking to Lord Nostoc Greyspine, who owns the mines at the very bottom of Kraghammer proper. After a brief encounter with a mutated abomination of a Naga creature, they were then hired by lord Nostoc to go into the mines, find whatever's creating these abominations, destroy whatever is the source of them, and he will pay well and also pay for each creature head that is brought to him individually. After getting into the mines, a few battles ensue with some of the local denizens, couple of the umber hulks, that were turned into snails, and other interesting circumstances. The party then found what looked to be an entirely abandoned goblin city, and a series of goblinoid corpses, many of which had bored holes in their skull in various states of decay. They found a long bridge across an open chasm. Upon traversing it, Scanlan went invisible, and found what looked like a duergar war camp, which are like ashy-skinned, evil dwarves that live deep underground. Watched a dwarf get executed by what appeared to be some sort of strange alienoid creature, that was revealed to be an illithid, or a mind flayer. A being that is psychic and consumes brains.
Ashley: Brains!
Matt: Upon returning, the party had a plan to lead them off of a illusionary cliff, that went pretty well. Ended up taking out a significant portion of the charging army at the time. Vax here, however, got stunned on the way across by the one mind flayer, nearly fell, however was saved by Tiberius at the last moment. Nearly lost their magic carpet, but it was retrieved.
Ashley: Wait, you still have the magic carpet, right?
Matt: Yeah, it got recovered. Barely.
Marisha: We got it back, it's okay.
Travis: Not thanks to some.
Matt: (laughs) After brief discussion, Keyleth and Vex decided they didn't want to listen to anyone's bullshit, and hijacked magic carpet, flew down into the chasm below, and discovered behind one of the underground waterfalls some sort of a mind flayer who was cast out from the society, covered in rags, kind of a twisted physical form, and after a very tense discussion seemed to befriend it under the guise of mutually agreed retribution against those that are oppressive to this whole chasm area.
Marisha: Clarence.
Liam: Clarota.
Sam: Clarota.
Matt: Clarota. I don't think he'll take kindly to Clarence. However, this is where we left off the previous game.
Ashley: So nervous.
Matt: As you guys have gathered up, and you've finished your luxurious song to try and ease his torn form, he finishes tapping his toe in spite of himself. Looks about the rest of the group and says, once again, not vocally, but speaking directly into your mind, through a horrifying whispered voice that you cannot even close your ears to get rid of, "I think it's best we rest out of sight." He points across the chasm, to the war camp that is looming across the way. He begins to dart off towards the abandoned goblinoid village.
Orion: I guess we should follow him, then.
Sam: Yes, that's wise.
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Sam: We follow.
Taliesin: No, nothing can be there.
Matt: As you guys make your way in toward the goblinoid village, you can see Clarota who is genuinely hovering about a foot off the ground, and kind of just coasting around in a very creepy way. Finds one tent, opens up and looks inside, "Here, here we can talk." Darts inside.
Travis: We follow.
Sam: We do follow, yes.
Matt: As you're following--
Travis: Oh crap.
Sam: Oh God, we're dead.
Travis: Why? Why would he touch his dice? We're gonna die!
Matt: As you're following towards the center of this town, you, see in the distance, a small light moving, back from the direction where you first saw that duergar camp, where Grog was assaulted.
Travis: I don't recall that.
Liam: Look back the way we came, there's some sort of light up ahead.
Orion: That can't be good.
Liam: Stay with Clarota, I'm gonna go take a look, Scanlan, come on.
Sam: I'm coming with.
Matt: Both of you guys roll stealth.
Travis: I'll stay outside the tent if somebody wants to ask him how to get a Magneto helmet like his. (all laugh) 'Cause I'm gonna need that.
Orion: I'll talk to him.
Sam: It's just a roll? Not great. Nine!
Liam: 29.
Taliesin: That's a number.
Matt: So, as you officially vanish into the ether and surrounding darkness, Scanlan, who still has that song stuck in his head from earlier, his slow jam is just... (laughs) Abstractedly humming to himself without realizing, and calling a little bit of attention, at which point you began to hear some footsteps in the distance that come to an immediate halt.
Liam: Grab Scanlan, put my hand over his mouth, and say, Quiet, man, what's wrong with you?
Sam: It's a nervous habit! I'm sorry! (all laugh)
Liam: With great power comes great responsibility, shut up!
Sam: It's a gift I have to share with the world!
Liam: Later, later. Save it for the mind flayer. So with him tucked under my arm like a football, I start to creep further. And try to make out-- if there's light from the lantern, I can see in dim light, thanks to daddy's blood, so. I'm gonna try to figure out what it is exactly that I'm seeing.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: I also have low light vision.
Matt: You can make perception check with disadvantage, because you're under his arm.
Liam: Perception check? Oh.
Sam: Nope.
Liam: Do I have any advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Liam: 11.
Matt: All right. Actually, directly looking in the direction of that duergar camp earlier, you can see behind a pillar that's blocking your view, it's obstructing your view of the actual camp proper, you can see some movement in the light. You hear some shuffling, it sounds like plate. You hear a voice just kind of muttering to itself. A familiar, female gnomish voice.
Liam: Pike?
Ashley: Hey guys! (all laugh)
Ashley: It's me, Pike!
Liam: Jeez, where have you been?
Ashley: Oh man, I've had quite a time. I've missed you guys terribly. A lot has happened. I'm sure for you guys as well.
Sam: Not so much.
Orion: I say into my thing, "Scanlan, what the hell's going on?"
Sam: Don't worry, it's a friend, we'll bring her back soon.
Orion: Okay, well, there's a mind flayer here.
Sam: Keep him busy. He likes slow jams.
Orion: Right, right.
Matt: As you guys take a look at Pike, you notice she's fully armored, but dirty, she's got sweat across her face, looks like she may have had a couple scuffles on the way through here.
Ashley: I did.
Matt: She's got a wild look to her eyes.
Sam: Oh my God.
Matt: Genuinely relieved to see you. Pike, you've managed to come down here through the front of the mines, which for the most part have been clear. You follow what details you can after asking around and discovering that the rest of your party had ventured below without you. You've followed the tracks best you can, and are glad that you at least chose the right path and ran into them before you ran into something far more dangerous. What you were inspecting was this campsite that appeared to have been abandoned. What caught your eye was against the stone wall right above the ring of stones that form the fire itself, there is a giant symbol carved into the stone that is a protective sigil of Bahamut, the platinum dragon, which is a religious symbol of protection, used in different divine rituals.
Liam: We were looking at that, we couldn't make heads or tails of it. You ever seen that before?
Ashley: No. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make a religion check.
Liam: Are you sure? Think about it, just for a moment longer.
Ashley: Well give me, actually, let me rethink on this. I think maybe--
Marisha: So wait, are we all reunited?
Liam: Oh, it's a natural 20!
Marisha: Oh, welcome back Pike!
Travis: The first roll.
Marisha: Are we all reunited?
Liam: You just forgot.
Ashley: I just-- you know what? Actually, now that I'm thinking about it. (all laugh)
Matt: You clutch your holy symbol instinctually as you reach up and run your fingers along the stonework, tracing the carving across the stone. As you do, your eyes close, and you feel the warmth of Sarenrae's presence fill your mind for a second, and for a split moment, you can see a well-armored, very driven, female halfling with hair pulled back into tight brown braids, a dark green cloak thrown over one shoulder, who's currently carving that symbol into the stone. You're seeing Lady Kima of Vord, the one who left this symbol, to protect her campsite as she made up camp here. You don't know how long ago this transpired, but this was definitely left by her in this tunnel.
Liam: What is it?
Ashley: It was left by a woman.
Sam: Lady Kima, the one we're trying to find?
Ashley: Yes, Lady Kima.
Liam: How did you know that?
Sam: Me and Pike are like--
Travis: Oh, Jesus.
Sam: It's so great to see you, you look fantastic by the way.
Ashley: I don't feel fantastic.
Sam: Bring it in, bring it in, give me a hug. Ooh, you smell a little. I like it though. Somehow it works on you.
Liam: We're in a very complicated situation, a lot has happened to us. We found sort of a war camp down here, and there is sort of a being, I don't know what to call it. He's got a little of this going on, and he speaks and lashes out through his mind. We fought a huge force down here, and then we ended up falling into a cavern, and then Keyleth and my sister found another one, what are they called? They're called-- illithids.
Sam: Yes, yes. And we found a rogue one, and we may team up with him-- or her?-- to go back and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp.
Liam: This just happened. He seems extremely dangerous, however, the forces we faced in the other illithid seem maybe worse. So that's where we're at.
Sam: So welcome back. Great, sounds like a fun time.
Sam: Let's rejoin our friends, shall we?
Ashley: Let's go kick some ass.
Sam: So we trot back over to the dead goblin village.
Matt: All right, you make your way back to the tent that was originally scouted out. The rest of the party's there waiting as Clarota is awkwardly sitting in the far end, just looking out as all of you slowly approach and enter the tent. Not speaking, just reactionary, and keeping a watch on all of you.
Orion: I turn to Clarota, I'm like, "Ooh, that's our friend, Pike. She's a good ally. Hello, Pike!"
Ashley: Hello everybody.
All: (gasp) Pike!
Orion: Sometimes we hug as allies, Clarota.
Marisha: Where have you been? ASHLEY Well, I had quite a time. When we were up on the tower, I noticed something, and I felt... I had to leave, because I started to have a vision.
Orion: Oh, those are fun.
Ashley: I feel like I should talk to you guys about this later, just because--
Sam: It's personal?
Ashley: What is your name? I'm so sorry. I'm Pike, it's very nice to meet you.
Matt: You get a better look as you approach this entity. You see what looks like a very tall, thin, gaunt-looking humanoid with a hood over the head as you approach. You get a better look at the facial features. Smooth, kind of dull, bluish-purple skin. These sunken, creepy, yellowish green eyes, and instead of where a mouth or nose would be, you see four slightly twitching tentacles. Barely obscuring what looks like a round lamprey-like toothed maw.
Liam: Pike, this is Clarota. We've just met.
Ashley: Can I shake his hand?
Matt: Do you wanna reach your hand out?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: There is no physical response, the hand is not extended, but you hear, in the middle of your mind, at full volume, a creepy whispered voice go, "Are you to be one of our allies as well?"
Ashley: Yes. Of course.
Matt: "Very well, she may stay."
Orion: Thank you very much, Clarota.
Ashley: I take my hand and scratch the back of my head. (all laugh)
Marisha: I take Pike and I kind of pull her out of the tent really quick, and I'm like--
Sam: Girl talk.
Marisha: Okay he's like a mind flayer, and we found him in a hole under a waterfall, but he's cool, but he wants vengeance.
Ashley: Is that-- the thing is covering, so he can't be--
Marisha: He's like outcast, yeah. But he's gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us.
Liam: Clarota.
Ashley: Do we know for sure he's helping us?
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: Can you help us understand your kind? Your history? How you've come to be here and who this individual is that is fucking with your shit? (all laugh)
Matt: Proverbial statement, I like that. At which point Clarota's eyes narrow, and you can feel just the general mood and energy of the inside of the tent grows dark. It grows mildly tense. Suddenly you feel this presence, a voice once again, fill your mind as Clarota says, "Seven years since I discovered my curse. My form was struck with the brand of the Arcane. And these foul arts proved difficult to conceal. My brethren could sense my impurity, my deviation, and cast me out. I was severed from the Elder Brain. And chased on threat of death, should I return. I wandered these tunnels in squalor, feeding on what paltry filth I could ensnare, and fleeing from the ones I could not face alone. In my wandering, I discovered a duergar stronghold, with a magma pool, and it proved to be a decent source of sustenance for some time. Paying off the occasional straggler. Suddenly a great battle took place. It appeared something had sieged the stronghold. Reading the surface thoughts of the deep dwarves I encountered in the following weeks, I found a shift of power. Whatever had taken this hold had now demanded fealty of them. And they accepted when faced with annihilation. This entity that took the duergar by force, they called K'varn. I caught no sight of it. But the fear I could sense, from within these doors were so primal, so great, that I knew to keep a distance to be safe. But four months ago one of my estranged people, was captured by these ash-skins, and brought within the obsidian walls, for what I assumed was interrogation. Long after, the bulk of the Duergar people marched in packs through the long, deep tunnels that led to my people's colony and attacked. Strangely, before much bloodshed could occur, which I only assume was the next step in this onslaught, the fighting stopped. And the colony allowed the ash skins to waltz directly into the temple, unharmed, unchallenged, where our Elder Brain resides. It wasn't until after I discovered whoever this K'varn is, they themselves infiltrated the temple, and somehow took the Elder Brain under their own control. I watched as my people had their will robbed of them. And they took the will of all the others that lived and breathed in these tunnels. Now, a terrible army is forged of both factions. And they walk under the banner of this K'varn. Since this, I've fled back to the higher tunnels, and scrounged for materials so I could shield myself from the iron grip influence of the now enslaved Elder Brain. It took me weeks. But I'm confident I'm safe from its influence. For now."
Taliesin: Is that the thing that you wear upon your head?
Matt: As it pulls the hood back, you see once again this kind of haphazard, metallic cluster of patches of metal, and iron, this dull kind of blue metallish glow, that you can only now see once he's sitting in near pitch darkness. As he reaches up and runs his finger along it, "Yes. This I feel can protect me. But I think... I think there is a way to change the tides of this circumstance, I feel that if I could somehow free my people from the influence of K'varn, release its hold on the hive mind, my people would allow me to rejoin the colony. To be one again with my family. My brethren."
Liam: I have a few questions. Is that all right?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: You and your brethren, without this, do you think as one?
Matt: "We think as individuals, but the hive mind connects us all. The hive mind gives us knowledge, history, direction. It is the source of our family."
Liam: So, one individual of your family sees something, the entire hive sees the same, is that correct?
Matt: "Yes."
Orion: Oh dear, that's no good. (all laugh)
Liam: And you mentioned the Arcane being a stigma upon you?
Matt: At which point it turns its gaze away, and slinks down into its form slightly.
Liam: What do your brethren put their faith in, if not the Arcane?
Matt: "They put their faith in the arts of the mind. Both understanding, manipulating, controlling, and devouring."
Orion: Clarota, we've already allied ourselves with you, as we've already agreed.
Matt: "You'll help me free my people? To be family again, to belong."
Orion: As we said, yes. But the thing you wear on your head, it would make us all the more equipped to take on this task. It's against such powerful mind creatures, such as yourself, I know my way around a couple Arcane things, but nothing of the mind control sorts. If someone like me were to be influenced, it would be very bad for our group. Even yourself, perhaps. It would do well to at least maybe show us how you built it, and-- You get what I'm getting at, right?
Travis: I would like a steel beanie as well.
Ashley: Basically, where do we get one of those?
Matt: "It would take weeks to build another."
Travis: Weeks?
Taliesin: I would like to take a look into it if possible, and see if it makes sense. I am a builder.
Marisha: Maybe we can figure out something a little bit more jerryrigged.
Taliesin: If we were all hidden, we would have a distinct advantage.
Travis: I have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding. Could I wear that on me noggin?
Taliesin: If you like.
Matt: It gives you a look in response and says, "This protects me from the influence of the hive mind, my preexisting connection."
Taliesin: Could we be hidden from them? Would there be a way to cloak ourselves from their understanding?
Matt: "Stay hidden from the others. Their sight is the mind's sight. The Elder Brain is a collection of the once living mind flayers of my people."
Liam: I have one more question, and we have allied ourselves to you, that's true. But I'm curious to know, hopefully our goals intertwine, and we want the same thing. But once that is achieved, and it will be, what happens then for the Illithid? Do you return to your home below? Do your people harbor any ambition to move upward into Kraghammer?
Matt: It looks to the side and says, "Our ambition is to pursue the continuation of our knowledge-seeking. We have no interest in the surface. We only wish to spread our dominion here below. Expand our great city of Yug'Voril."
Liam: I'm sorry, what was that name?
Matt: "Yug'Voril."
Orion: Sounds like a lovely town, Yug'Voril.
Matt: "It's beautiful."
Taliesin: I feel that we could come to an arrangement.
Liam: I do as well.
Taliesin: We would require of you, at the very least, safe passage once we have helped you reunite with your people, for ourselves, and for a friend of ours who's lost in the darkness, who we are here to retrieve.
Matt: "For this deed, of freeing my people from this insidious presence that is K'varn..."
Taliesin: Freeing all of our people.
Matt: "I believe this could be arranged."
Liam: Scanlan, does he speak true?
Sam: Uh. Let's find out. (all laugh)
Sam: I'm gonna just see if I can detect any lies.
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Sam: What am I adding to this?
Liam: Insight.
Sam: Oh. 13. I'm not an insight person.
Ashley: Oh, can I--
Travis: (scoffs)
Liam: 20 over here!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Travis: She's rolled twice.
Ashley: Assisting, assisting. (all laugh)
Taliesin: All of your 20's, running out.
Matt: It's too late for the assist, unfortunately, 'cause it's already rolled.
Liam: But can she suss him out?
Matt: Best you can tell, those who are looking into it, he seems to be speaking from a point of desperation, and intent, as he has no other option. He is genuinely-- You can see it in the way he talks, and the way he speaks about his family. He's a little crazy. The isolation has put him to a point where he wants to return to his people, and will do whatever it takes to get back with them, however, he also seems to be, in a weird way that you can read, appreciative that you're willing to help, and seems to be, on his part, genuine. As a note, music's not playing? I don't know if there's a reason for that.
Travis: Did he say his eyes, the flayer's eyes, are what put people in trances, or their minds?
Sam: Yeah, the eyes, the eyes.
Travis: So if we wear helmets, it's not gonna help us.
Sam: No, the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind. It wouldn't help us at all.
Travis: I'll still wear the big bronze pot on my head.
Matt: You put the pot on your head. It's clunky.
Travis: On my whole head.
Matt: You cannot see with the pot on your head.
Travis: No, but I'm protected from the flayer.
Sam: Can you bore two like, ghost holes in?
Travis: I don't need it, I have incredible warrior skills.
Taliesin: Do their powers work with reflection?
Matt: "No, they can peer into your very mind."
Taliesin: But if we approach them using a reflective surface to view them, can they peer into our minds through a reflected surface?
Matt: "If they know you're there, you're in sight, they can read into you."
Travis: Shit.
Marisha: They can read our minds.
Matt: "If you are obscured, unknown to them, then you are hidden. They cannot sense you, but if they know you are there, they can peer, they can pry."
Liam: Is there any way to be hidden for us?
Matt: "Hidden from sight. Be hidden from knowledge. Be hidden from them."
Marisha: Clarence? Sorry, Clarota.
Sam: How about Clay?
Matt: "Clarota!"
Travis: Jesus.
Marisha: Sorry, Clarota. I just have one quick question. Why would you want to rejoin your colony after they've banished you? Why not leave?
Matt: "I have nowhere to go. They are my essence, my connection. I long to return. It is the way of my people, I understand this curse I hold. I spite myself, I look upon this disease, and spit. But perhaps, with this deed, they can overlook it."
Marisha: You're not diseased, you're special.
Travis: Oh, God.
Sam: Question, Clarota.
Matt: "You know nothing of my culture. You presume too much."
Liam: I think we do understand your desires though, and we can align ours with yours. So let us speak of specifics, Clarota.
Sam: Strategy.
Liam: Strategy.
Sam: Number one, that assortment of dwarves and some of your friends and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm. Is that something that we need to face headlong, or can we maybe surpass them, trying to find K'varn, or this temple that you speak of?
Matt: "We may if you wish. Their stronghold is far below. The magma leads the way. However, if I know what I've seen, the general resides in that camp. I know no way within the stronghold, without the brunt of their army. Perhaps the general can be pried for information. If you bring him to me."
Sam: "Bring him," so you won't be accompanying us on any adventure, or...?
Matt: "I will be coming."
Orion: We have to fetch him.
Sam: And the general is in that...
Orion: Where you were, right?
Sam: Yes, yes. So we have to go over.
Ashley: Did you say something about a temple, or did I completely misunderstand?
Matt: "There is a temple in our city. Where my people reside, that is where the Elder Brain sits."
Sam: We'll get there eventually, but first step is this smaller force across the chasm.
Travis: Yeah, we're gonna put the beat down. (all laugh)
Orion: Well said, Grog.
Marisha: You said there was a big army front, guarding this general? Of duergar?
Sam: Well, the general's right across the chasm.
Marisha: Oh, he's just right across the way?
Matt: "Their forces are gathering there. The bulk of their army currently is divided between that and the stronghold below."
Liam: Percy shot this one, I think.
Taliesin: I did.
Liam: I think it's important to point out that your kin, this general, is aware of at least three of us, of my dragonborn friend, the singer over here, and myself.
Sam: I don't think he knows about me.
Travis: No, you were invisible.
Liam: Just us, then.
Orion: I don't even know if he saw me. He saw my funny cards.
Liam: True, it could be just me then.
Orion: Oh, I cast Prestidigitation on Pike and I clean her up real quick.
Liam: You look lovely. How do you think your kin will react to that? What will their response be if they know that outsiders have come? If they've seen just me at this moment, plus a few illusions.
Matt: "They will be prepared. So you must find another way in. You must think how to not be seen."
Travis: Think. (all laugh)
Orion: Don't worry, Grog.
Matt: You've never ever, in your life, ever heard someone else chuckle inside your brain, but you hear within the center of yours: (chuckles) "Think, yes."
Travis: Oh ho, it echoes in the pot. (all laugh) But I start laughing to myself. (silly laughter)
Liam: Can I assume that you would have already given us any advice by now if you knew a way? Are we stuck with our own resources?
Matt: "I've only watched from a distance. Getting too close was too dangerous. I only read surface thoughts. If I were seen, I would be nothing, I would be destroyed."
Liam: So no back doors, no secret entrances that you know of, into the camp, anywhere near this general?
Matt: "None."
Liam: Fuck.
Travis: What's in the bottom of the crevasse?
Sam: It's water and magma.
Travis: Can we pick up the little loch ness monster and throw it at him or something?
Sam: Oh yes, down below, in the waters, our allies - Vex, and uh, somebody. (all laugh) Found some creatures under the water, snatching bodies as they fell. Keyleth. Yes, I forgot who went.
Orion: Her majesty, Keyleth.
Sam: Pike's beauty distracted me, you shouldn't have cleaned her up so nice.
Orion: I'm sorry.
Sam: Anyway, there were some creatures down below in the waters, are those anything that we could use, or should we just avoid them?
Matt: You see it actually hisses for a second, as soon as you mention this he goes, "No, avoid. That creature is older than all of us. It resides there, an ancient mind. One that should be Kept at bay. An aboleth."
Sam: Do you need a lozenge? (all laugh)
Matt: Its eyes narrow once again, not quite understanding the words you use, seemingly amused.
Sam: It's a gnome thing.
Matt: As a brief aside, too, I checked the connection on my iPad, I'm playing music fine, and the connection's in the iPad, I don't quite know where it's losing its connection. But I think we need some music.
Sam: All right, so let's review our options, shall we?
Travis: We're gonna charge in there.
Sam: We can't charge, there's a chasm.
Liam: How did that go with the little brain thing? Not too well.
Taliesin: The chasm is a problem.
Sam: Master switch.
Marisha: An entire colony of mind flayers.
Sam: We could fly in, right?
Liam: The bridge is gone, we have to--
Sam: We can fly in death from above.
Travis: I don't know if I can.
Sam: Well, we can figure out a way. Enough of us can turn into flying things to get you there.
Taliesin: We also have a flying carpet. We can repair the bridge if we had to, at least put a rope across.
Ashley: I think--
Sam: Or we could disguise ourselves somehow.
Ashley: I think I know where we need to go.
Sam: What?
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Really?
Liam: Get out of this city.
Marisha: Please, do tell.
Sam: So, hold on-- (static) (music)
Matt: There we go.
Sam: There's music.
Ashley: Oh wait, I think I read this wrong. (all laugh)
Sam: Pike, don't toy with our emotions.
Travis: You just got back.
Ashley: So you guys haven't gone to the war camp.
Sam: We have.
Ashley: You have.
Sam: We been there and we quickly retreated.
Liam: Scanlan took a poke about. He boofed himself out of sight and had a look around, and then we returned to the edge of it, and I kind of flipped the bird at them, and taunted them a little, but most of us haven't been in.
Ashley: Have you been to the lake?
Travis: None of us went in the water.
Sam: Lake? No, there's no-- what, there's a lake?
Ashley: Isn't that where that thing is?
Travis: The bottom of the crevasse, right?
Liam: Under the bridge, there was--
Sam: No, that's rushing water, that's not--
Matt: The area after the big drop that was at the bottom, there was a lake of water. And there was a waterfall coming out of the natural--
Liam: And the ogres were getting sucked under by something.
Travis: So we didn't go down there.
Marisha: Is there something under the lake?
Ashley: Well I just-- I don't know if I should be talking about this in front of him.
Travis: We could go away from him for a second.
Liam: He will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind.
Orion: Clarota is totally fine to talk in front of. He's amazing.
Ashley: Earmuffs. (all laugh)
Ashley: Well, shall I share a vision I had?
Liam: I think so, Pike. I think at this point, we should just move forward.
Ashley: In this vision that I had, I was pulled down toward the mines. Into the tunnels, below where the dwarves were working.
Marisha: Through the lake?
Ashley: Well, past the goblinoid creatures, and past a great underground lake. Past a jagged onyx colored fortress, framed in molten rock.
Travis: We haven't been there yet.
Ashley: Past a field of broken glass and bone. Have you seen any of this?
Taliesin: No.
Marisha: No.
Travis: I don't think an onyx fortress.
Orion: Those last things sound terrible.
Liam: Yes, that all sounds shitty. (all laugh)
Liam: The last thing we've seen is the lake, and we didn't go too close to it, because a couple of ogres fell in from above, and they disappeared like something grabbed them.
Travis: We didn't have him fly down there and get a close look.
Liam: No, we haven't had a look around.
Ashley: I wonder if there's like--
Marisha: I can cast Water Breathing on all of us.
Travis: Why don't we send one, like Mars Rover over here, and have him go check it out?
Marisha: I can always turn into, like, a whale.
Liam: Perhaps, but the water breathing sounds good to me. I feel like a head-on--
Travis: Isn't there something in the water?
Liam: -- run into the chasm is a bad idea.
Orion: I pull out my empty bottle, and I go, and I have this!
Liam: Yes, he's got a bottle, plus, we've killed a fucking dragon. I know it's not an easy task to accomplish, but we're pretty badass, I think. We might have a good chance.
Marisha: So wait, is going through the lake gonna get us through to the general?
Liam: Well, we don't know.
Travis: We haven't been down to the water's surface.
Sam: What's the best-case scenario? What, we come up behind them? It's still gonna be a fight.
Travis: But maybe there's a different vantage point.
Sam: We can fly over them, that seems like a pretty good attack point.
Taliesin: Some of us can fly over them.
Marisha: Well we can figure out to where where all of us can fly over them. I'm more concerned about us cloaking ourselves. Even if we're flying they're still going to see us.
Sam: There's an ancient death thing down there.
Travis: He might die, didn't say it was foolproof.
Sam: I don't know, man, he's volunteering you.
Orion: Wait, what's going on?
Liam: I mean, our options are we can vote on it, although we all know Keyleth is just gonna go fucking do whatever she wants. Our options are--
Marisha: That was one time.
Liam: Just the one time.
Marisha: Just one time.
Travis: Never to be forgotten.
Liam: Our options are a headlong advance into the middle of their camp. That's a big fucking force.
Sam: Or some sort of disguise, distraction.
Travis: Tiberius.
Matt: Is the stream down by the way?
Zac: It goes down every two hours and 17 minutes, it's been doing that for-- It comes right back up.
Matt: All right, so let us know when it's back up.
Sam: Two hours and 17 minutes, that sounds like Lost or something.
Travis: Tiberius. Do it.
Marisha: Amityville Twitch stream.
Travis: Go fly all the way down to the water's surface. Like Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future 2, and check out if there's any other tunnels that we haven't seen, or ways to go.
Orion: Isn't this the same water that you bended?
Marisha: I think so.
Travis: We didn't go down to the water's surface though, did we?
Marisha: Well, we went over the top of it, and kind of looked down.
Travis: Oh, we did? We went all the way down?
Marisha: When I was bending the water back, we were kind of in that area, right? That was that area, but the lake--
Sam: Do it smart. Let's go bomb them.
Ashley: What if, I mean--
Travis: Can you freeze it?
Ashley: Do you guys wanna like, put me down on a rope, and I can just run around, see if there's any openings? I mean I have a lot of armor.
Liam: Go fishing with you?
Marisha: Go fishing, yeah.
Ashley: Well no, just like halfway, and then I can run around and look for tunnels. Well some of us can fly, so we're okay.
Marisha: I can attempt to try and drain the lake a little bit.
Liam: And Keyleth said that she can cast Water Breathing, can help us breathe underneath the surface.
Travis: We have two underwater breathing potions.
Marisha: Control Water's a level five spell.
Matt: I realize that. But that's a lot of water.
Travis: But remember, we're slow as balls in water.
Liam: You were having trouble, if I recall, just getting the waterfall out of the way to create, I mean it was amazing, but--
Marisha: I managed to get it stopped--
Liam: I know, you fucking saved the day, but we're talking about--
Marisha: A lake.
Liam: Yeah, Lake Superior.
Sam: This is not just a lake, there is a death monster in there. If we go under the water, we're dead.
Travis: Can we stand on it? Anything, if we wanna fight it? Or are we gonna be fighting it in the water?
Taliesin: Well, we can all have Water Breathing.
Travis: Yeah, but we'll be slow.
Sam: And we'll be underwater, where there's a death monster.
Travis: I'm not worried about that part of the question.
Liam: There's 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top.
Sam: Well, then let's come up with a good plan.
Ashley: Maybe there's hidden stairs or something, like in Indiana Jones?
Travis: Can you electrify the water and fry the guy?
Liam: Hold up, hold up.
Orion: There's only 26 people up there. On our last count.
Taliesin: Before the ones we killed, or after?
Orion: After.
Liam: Those are the ones we saw, though. How do we know how far back the camp goes? How many are in the gate behind it?
Travis: Don't a couple of you have Lightning? Can't you deep-fry the water?
Marisha: I mean, I can make a giant whirlpool.
Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. Clarota, you've been listening to our thoughts for the last ten minutes.
Sam: And what clear thoughts they have been.
Liam: What do you think? What do you think?
Matt: "What resides in that lake is something you wish not to tamper with. An ancient mind."
Travis: Blah blah blah. Hodie-fucking-ho.
Matt: "It clouds the water with its own filth. You find yourself unable to breathe air."
Marisha: Didn't that happen already?
Matt: "Its mind, it takes--"
Liam: Have you seen it?
Matt: "Yes."
Liam: It's big?
Matt: "It's rather large."
Ashley: Is it like a many-armed ...situation? (all laugh)
Matt: "One could say, yes."
Ashley: Okay. Swell.
Liam: What's the sitch?
Marisha: So we can face Cthulhu, or little Cthulhu minons, seems to be our choice.
Orion: Clarota.
Travis: Why don't I have Lightning, I swear. Can't you fry the water first? See if it hurts it?
Sam: We can fly overhead and just Lightning the shit out of it.
Travis: Do that, please. 'Cause maybe there's a way-- there's a tunnel, and we come up behind them or whatever it was.
Liam: That illithid took out my brain from like 100 feet.
Sam: You know what-- wait, wait, if I may. When I was there, I saw the main general control all of them instantly, when he was about to make a sacrifice, or feed, or whatever he was doing. No offense. He instantly had all of their command. If we could somehow get to him, and cut off that connection, distract him, influence him somehow to command them to all jump in the lake, for instance. That would get rid of a lot of them all at once.
Liam: Can you make me invisible?
Sam: I can get you there. I can make you unseeable, but not invisible.
Liam: What?
Travis: What's the difference?
Sam: I can make you a fly.
Taliesin: May I examine-- without removing-- may I examine your device?
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Travis: Oh man, Percy, Percy.
Sam: What's he doing?
Orion: He's asking to--
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: What's he doing?
Sam: Touching the hat.
Matt: He glares at you and says, "Our agreement does not include this interaction."
Taliesin: It may be the key to returning you to your people.
Travis: Tiberius.
Orion: Yes?
Travis: Would you go fry the fucking lake?
Taliesin: I won't touch. I will just look.
Orion: I'm reading my book.
Travis: No, I want you to--
Matt: It kind of bows its head, but does not move closer. It just slightly shows you an element of it.
Taliesin: Can I understand how it functions?
Matt: Best you can tell it looks like a skullcap that's been kind of decently made for what it is, but you can see some of the hammer marks on it, or whatever it was put together. It appears to be a very simple piece of metallic material.
Taliesin: So it's magic.
Matt: It looks like it is some sort of enchantment, probably what's causing the effect. It's not any mechanical device that causes it.
Travis: (metal clanging)
Taliesin: So there'd be no way to build something to create a feedback loop?
Marisha: Ooh. I see what you're getting at.
Taliesin: I wanna try and see if there's any way that I can take a look at this and figure out a way to build some sort of feedback system.
Marisha: We need to build a coconut radio.
Sam: We don't even have a laboratory.
Taliesin: He wants a coconut radio.
Orion: I love coconuts.
Matt: You have never interacted with anything psionic-based before. The time to research that, and the materials needed to do it would take months.
Taliesin: Plan two--
Liam: This is a fairly shitty situation.
Travis: While all this is going on!
Taliesin: Because if they can't see, what if we blind them?
Liam: How?
Marisha: With some sort of interference?
Taliesin: With a really bright light.
Orion: Oh, I love doing light things.
Taliesin: What if they are so blind they can't actually see us coming?
Marisha: I believe Pike and I both have access to spells like that.
Sam: I assume that would make us pretty blind as well.
Marisha: Not necessarily.
Ashley: Not if we wear our--
Sam: -- sunglasses? (all laugh)
Taliesin: Can I attempt to build sunglasses?
Sam: Before we build sunglasses--
Matt: You can probably make a couple with the materials you have on hand. You are limited when it comes to resources, as you are currently halfway underground.
Taliesin: Even better.
Travis: Vax could show his ass, that's a pretty white light.
Taliesin: That's as white as it gets.
Liam: It's pale as shit. When I go to the beach, I don't tan, I stroke.
Sam: But I thought we established that they don't need visual contact to influence us, they just need to be able to be aware--
Taliesin: Once they have visual contact they can influence us, but they need to make that visual contact in the first place.
Matt: "The dark, deep dwarves, they hate light. This I know."
Marisha: I think it'll stun them long enough for us to get across.
Taliesin: If we could perhaps put some Light spells on the back and the front of our shields, so that we are guarded from it.
Orion: If you can make a pair for our friend here, that would help him out, I assume.
Marisha: Wait, that's not a bad idea. Pike, can we temporarily enchant the magic carpet as a spotlight as we fly over? As a light death ray?
Liam: We've seen you surrounded in radiant light before, you think you can do that to the carpet?
Ashley: I mean, I have--
Marisha: We should have Daylight. Where's my book? Where's my Player's Handbook?
Liam: And Clarota, while they're figuring that out, if we remain to be hidden or blind our opponents as we approach your kin, will not know our thoughts 'til they see us?
Matt: "Yes. They need to look into you, by knowing you're there."
Liam: Can I fight one of your kin with a blindfold on?
Matt: "Perhaps."
Travis: I thought if they could see you--
Orion: Clarota. The mind hive that you possess, how close can one be before it actually affects? Say 100 feet, caught my friend in mid air, alas, in their run-in. Is its range about--?
Matt: "That's about the distance, yes."
Sam: You may not know the answer to this. I don't doubt your knowledge and wisdom, but I happen to have a ring with mind shielding, will that aid me in any way?
Matt: "It may. If it gives you resistance to psionic influence, it would be of aid, yes."
Marisha: Daylight.
Travis: Do we have a plan?
Liam: It wouldn't be hard to get hold of some pitch down here, some tar.
Sam: To burn?
Liam: No. If you can be invisible, and you have a ring of mind shielding, and you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker, you can splash it on its face, cover its eyes, and it's helpless.
Taliesin: My God.
Sam: Or I can hang that big brass pot on its head.
Travis: But I'm wearing that.
Liam: Yes, but it could take it off, possibly. If you smear sticky shit on its eyes--
Sam: So wait, I just have to blind it?
Liam: Then it can't control--
Sam: Well, I happen to have a Blindness spell!
Matt: "It may still try, but to be blind, it would be very difficult for it to pry into your mind."
Sam: Could it still control the others, though?
Matt: "Probably. That is a permanent enslavement."
Sam: So you want me to go in there, solo, invisible, and try to blind this thing.
Liam: No, not solo.
Sam: I'm in!
Liam: I like your idea of turning me into a fly. You and I go in--
Taliesin: And we've got Light spells.
Marisha: Pike and I can cast Daylight on our magic carpet.
Ashley: I can cast it onto my shield, and then on the carpet, and we would have a double--
Marisha: I have to take a nap, though. What's that?
Liam: But that could get us in close. Scanlan and I could get in closer, and blind it, and I could stab it in the head.
Marisha: I mean, technically I can also turn into something flying, I could back you guys up, if someone else wants to take the carpet.
Sam: We can all get there. We can all get there.
Marisha: I can cast Daylight on your helmet. On your pot helmet.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: That I'm game with
Marisha: All right.
Travis: I'll be like a lighthouse, walking around. Crushing life. (all laugh)
Matt: You'd be the cover of John Carpenter's "The Thing."
Liam: Did everyone hear Percy, that's a good idea.
Taliesin: Two fronts.
Liam: Yes, two fronts.
Sam: What is it?
Liam: You and I separate from the group, they go in shining like a beacon, you and I (buzzes) in, and while the illithid is focused on them, we go in, you blind him, and I stab him in his maw. It's pretty good.
Sam: That's a suicide mission.
Travis: I like it, let's do it.
Liam: What else are we going to do?
Taliesin: I'm behind this plan.
Sam: Surgical, special ops, seal team six.
Marisha: What does Vax have to say about this?
Liam: Vex, you mean? My sister Vex?
Marisha: Yes, that one.
Liam: That's a good question.
Sam: Oh, Vex, you look so tired.
Matt: Vex, your sister seems genuinely perturbed by the circumstance, but looks to you and says, "Look, I found him, you deal with the situation. Just tell me what to do."
Sam: She's so like that. (all laugh) ASHLEY Let's do it.
Liam: I gave up trying to understand her years ago.
Marisha: Do you know what time it is? I'm feeling a bit nappy.
Orion: Your hair looks fine.
Liam: Well, I--
Sam: Wait-- (shushes)
Matt: "If you need rest, then rest. Time of day has no bearing down here."
Marisha: I have to rest so I can-- I'm gonna read up on this Daylight spell, so that you and me can both cast it. ASHLEY Yeah, we'll just take a nap and just get, you know, rest our muscles, and get ready for the fight.
Travis: I'm gonna read up on this Chopping Head spell. Yep, I'm read up.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little song to inspire a couple of my allies here, if I can.
Matt: Okay, I would recommend doing it after rest. The dice would go away while they rest.
Sam: Okay, forget it.
Marisha: I go ahead and I light an incense in our teepee, and I make some flowers grow. That's better. That's nice.
Taliesin: I'm gonna do a little bit of work on that first trick arrow. On the trap arrow. Since I've got a little time.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll.
Taliesin: That's a-- What am I rolling?
Matt: Your engineering-- your tinker's kit.
Taliesin: Oh, it's just an intelligence roll, right?
Matt: Plus your tinker's kit proficiency. It's down underneath your skills. Proficiency, at the very bottom left.
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't have a number for that.
Matt: You can add your proficiency modifier to your intelligence check. Add your intelligence modifier plus four.
Taliesin: Ah, thank you. 17.
Matt: All right, and so what are you trying to accomplish with this arrow again?
Taliesin: I was just trying to make an entanglement arrow. It's a trapper's arrow.
Matt: Okay. You manage to work out what seems like a tanglefoot bag-type detonation, where if an arrow were fired, it would be a grapple check against the individual, probably give them penalties until they're able to break free of the grapple. So yeah, success on that one.
Travis: Nice job, Doogie.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be Hawkeyeing Laura out at some point, I got a couple of them.
Orion: Before I retire, Clarota, you said you wanted to speak with me later. Anything in particular, or you wish to save it for after the battle?
Matt: "Perhaps after. I just am curious about the source of your Arcane power."
Orion: Ooh, I'd be happy to discuss it. I could learn a great deal from you as well.
Matt: "Later."
Orion: Later, of course. I go to my books.
Matt: So Clarota closes his eyes, and kind of goes into a meditative stance. The rest of you, those who have spells to choose, go ahead and choose your spells accordingly for the next day.
Travis: Rub it in. I'm sharpening my ax.
Matt: Good. Good.
Travis: It is good.
Sam: Just doing my vocal warmups. ♫ Me me me me me me me me me ♫
Marisha: I'm meditating.
Sam: ♫ Molto bene, molto bene, molto bene, molto bene ♫
Travis: The human torch was denied a bank loan. (all laugh)
Matt: So as you all have your evening's rest... Not very comfortable. Number one, you're in the middle of a tent of a goblinoid city. Second, just the general proximity of sleeping near an illithid, you just have a general sense of unsettling dreams, imagery that is disturbing. Pike, you have many flashbacks to the vision you had, and actually wake partway through the night in a cold sweat. As you wake up, you all kind of slowly come to, it's about four hours into the evening's rest. You feel a slight tremor, a familiar tremor that you felt once before in this cavern. (rumbling) You feel the ground begin to vibrate and shake.
Taliesin: I get up and look around.
Sam: Is Clay awake? (all laugh)
Matt: Eyes are open, just sitting there.
Sam: Clarota, do you know what that rumbling is?
Matt: "There are many creatures that live in this rock. You'd best be still."
Sam: Ooh, still.
Matt: "Still."
Orion: Don't move.
Travis: So, vocal warm ups.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check.
Marisha: Oh!
Travis: Fucking nipples.
Marisha: Pooper.
Travis: We get advantage on that, right?
Matt: Nope!
Orion: 16.
Sam: 14.
Marisha: 19.
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: 20.
Ashley: One.
Travis: One. (all laugh)
Matt: Two natural ones?
Travis: Yup!
Sam: After her two natural 20's.
Liam: Nothing to add.
Ashley: Nothing to add. Well I'm new to armor, you know.
Matt: You both rolled natural ones. Those both count as two failures.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Thankfully, the rest of your group all rolled pretty high. So it was four versus five.
Orion: Yes!
Matt: You guys just barely succeed. As you all hold still, barely breathe, the rumbling intensifies, and goes on for a good minute, minute and a half, before it eventually subsides.
Travis: Aw. Thought we were gonna get a warm up.
Matt: Fades into the distance. Rumbling is complete. It appears to be no issue. Clarota says, "Many of these creatures, they pick up on movement, in that sound, be wary."
Liam: What creatures are you speaking of now? Is this something--
Sam: The rumbling creatures.
Liam: But what are they?
Orion: Probably buttholes.
Matt: "I've only got glimpses."
Liam: This is something worse than umberhulks, I assume.
Matt: "Larger, yes."
Sam: All right, we've all rested up.
Liam: Buttholes in the underdark!
Sam: I had a crazy dream. It said if Geek & Sundry got to 1,400 followers, there would be some sort of a giveaway.
Orion: Oh, I had the same dream, Scanlan!
Sam: Wow!
Matt: Yeah guys, just so you're aware, every 50 subscribers we get, we are giving away an awesome Geek & Sundry game package.
Zac: Ethanmyhead just won one.
Matt: Oh, there you go, congratulations! We already got a winner. We'll be putting those out for every 50 subscribers we get tonight. We'll be choosing one to win that awesome award, our wonderful package, so keep that in mind.
Sam: So the plan is again, you and I, stealth. The rest, attack with light? What's first, what's second, what happens here?
Liam: Well, I need to take a moment to find some-- I'm gonna look around and see if I can find any pitch, anywhere in the goblin camp.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, this would be investigation.
Liam: Investigation. I got the exact same number, 12.
Matt: Takes about an hour. You manage to find, essentially, a few piles of rather disgusting, sticky, goblinoid refuse, that you imagine will probably stick and burn pretty well. In a pitch-type way, yeah.
Liam: Goblin shit?
Matt: You find just a whole bunch of goblin shit.
Liam: Let's cook it up a little.
Taliesin: How do you feel about lacing it with gun powder?
Sam: I'll make some fire for you.
Liam: Feel pretty good about that.
Marisha: Goblin molotov cocktails? I like that.
Taliesin: Goblin poop cocktail.
Liam: So here's how I think this goes. I think the team infuses the carpet, and any shields, or head pots they have with radiant light. They go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp. You and I go in, you're invisible. I'm a--
Sam: Fly, flea, mosquito, dragonfly, whatever you'd like.
Liam: Yes, let's say fly. We go in, find the illithid, and then we pop in, you yell, "Hey, Spanky," throw goblin shit in its face.
Sam: Or I try to blind it with magic.
Liam: Yes.
Taliesin: Both.
Orion: Both! Why not both?
Liam: We want to increase our odds. As soon as he's blind, I go in for the kill. And then it's on us to deal with what happens after that.
Travis: It's playtime.
Liam: It's playtime.
Sam: Might I suggest one other wrinkle.
Liam: Yes, please do.
Sam: Remember there are some dwarves being held captive. We can make our way to them and release them.
Travis: We don't need all of them, though. Just to cause further distraction, or to get some allies on the inside.
Liam: It's possible they could be weary, frightened.
Taliesin: Mind controlled.
Liam: Seems unreliable-- yes, mind controlled.
Travis: They're probably ready to fight, like me. (all laugh)
Sam: Grog, we understand, you want to bash some things.
Liam: Your time to kill is coming.
Sam: All right, is there anyone else in the party who could help us with stealth, or anything?
Ashley: Definitely not me.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Clang clang. ASHLEY Clang clang clang clang.
Matt: As a note, just remember. Because you're the one who walked through. There is essentially a shanty town, a tent city of war tents. With a few rock formations. You also notice that, or you remember last time, that there was the main square that had the raised platform. And then there was the small stone barracks, where it seemed both the mind flayer and the duergar general both went back in.
Sam: So we gotta go into the barracks.
Matt: Well that's where you saw at least they were last time you were there.
Liam: That's our starting point, I imagine.
Orion: Well, there's two targets.
Sam: So we gotta get in, and then get in.
Liam: The main thing is to get the illithid, because if he's out, nobody's-- Then they're all separate. He's playing chess with all his minions until we take him out.
Travis: I hate chess.
Orion: So we all strike right on him. You two are going to take that little journey. The rest of us, what shall we do? I have many options and they're all fun. So Percy. Your sniper rifle. I should think that you want to post up and start taking out position.
Taliesin: I'll do that at first, but then eventually I'm going to just have to jump into the fray.
Orion: Yes, of course, onslaught to the rest of the camp, that we'll go about it too, right? Make a bunch of noise, a bunch of light.
Sam: How are you going to get Grog over there?
Marisha: I'm gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head, and I'm gonna release him to the wilds.
Liam: Yes, but there's no bridge, we talked about--
Marisha: Oh, how are we gonna get him over it?
Liam: We have an infinite amount of rope.
Sam: How do we get it over there?
Liam: Tiberius talks about making him light as a feather.
Travis: Or you can fly me.
Sam: Yes, you can fly him, right?
Orion: Perhaps you can fly.
Travis: Why don't we turn my pot into a lighthouse, and then you fly me over, and I'll do like, abominable snow man walk.
Marisha: I like that.
Liam: Clarota, is there anything you can do to help us on this endeavor?
Matt: "I can try to cloud his mind with mine, but you have to swear to protect me from harm."
Liam: You have our word.
Sam: -- that we will try. (all laugh)
Matt: "Then I will come. You must work swiftly. If we can leap most of the city, get to that barrack, storm it, and take out the mind flayer that resides."
Sam: Let's set down right in the middle of the thing.
Marisha: Well I was gonna say, can we set down where we're kind of backing you guys up, holding the fort down while you guys go?
Liam: There's no bridge.
Sam: We all have to get there.
Marisha: I'm not worried about that.
Liam: Get over together, get to the edge.
Sam: Yes, but where are we going to make land? In the middle of the shit, next to the barracks?
Marisha: I say we might as well go closest to the barracks as we can get.
Sam: Okay, then you and I can get in the barracks.
Liam: That's a good idea. If we go as high as we can, and just hug the ceiling of this motherfucker, and then go down in the middle. And as we're going down, you turn me into a fly and go invisible, and that's when all hell breaks lose.
Travis: I like that part. Let's do it.
Liam: No time like the present.
Travis: Hands up if you're in.
Marisha: I'm gonna start buffing people like crazy.
Orion: I cast Stoneskin.
Taliesin: Gonna be buffing us like a vampire slayer.
Marisha: Oh! Joss Whedon up in this bitch!
Sam: Question to the dungeon master.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: I think my Polymorph spell is a concentration spell.
Matt: It is, yes.
Sam: I'm going solo. (sighs)
Travis: Do it.
Sam: I can get you in. I can make you a fly, but I can't be invisible at the same time.
Liam: I will sneak through. If shit goes south, I will peel off and join the others.
Marisha: Well, I can cast Pass Without A Trace on myself, and as long as we hug close to me, there's an area around me that's like a dark shadow. We get like, all stealthy.
Sam: We're going in.
Liam: We're just gonna have to improvise that. We'll do it live, we'll do it live.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait! Don't go in yet. Let me buff people.
Matt: You said you were casting Stoneskin? Stoneskin is concentration. The moment you cast another concentration spell, it goes away.
Orion: Oh, right. So I don't cast it, then. (all laugh) God damned concentration spells.
Travis: I would like to cast, um. (all laugh)
Travis: Blood Lust on myself. Blood Lust.
Marisha: I go ahead and I cast Enhance Ability on Vex.
All: Vax.
Liam: Sorry, everybody does it. Our mother did it, I do it sometimes.
Matt: To increase his dexterity?
Marisha: To increase your dexterity.
Matt: So essentially you have advantage on dexterity-based checks, yeah.
Marisha: Which is your stealth, right?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: And then I'm gonna go ahead and let me keep track of all this. And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on Grog's helmet. Are we ready for this, are we going?
Sam: Yeah, let's go.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And I'm gonna go ahead and cast Daylight on--
Sam: Wait.
Travis: What?
Sam: Wait. We're trying to sneak over them before we land. Don't cast Daylight on anything yet. We don't wanna be bright and shiny in the sky.
Matt: A giant flare coasting over the city.
Travis: We'll be like UFO's.
Liam: (hissing)
Marisha: I'm gonna go ahead and cast Pass Without A Trace on myself.
Matt: All right, so that's preparation there.
Sam: I'm gonna sing a little ditty to inspire Vax. ♫ I didn't see the Vax ♫ 'Cause he's so goddamned stealthy ♫ Da da da da da da da da
Travis: Was that "I Saw The Sun"?
Sam: Yes it was. (all laugh)
Matt: That wondrous rendition allows you a d8 inspiration dice, hold on to that.
Orion: Is everybody finished?
Liam: Vox Machina, let's do this shit.
Marisha: I turn into an eagle, and I'll take the gnomes.
Matt: All right. Scanlan. Pike is heavy with the plate mail, but it's still enough to carry with your giant eagle form.
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet, and Tiberius, are you good to help Grog fly across?
Orion: Fly.
Matt: At which point you feel this strange lifting sensation, for a second your stomach kind of has butterflies, and you realize that you can just think forward, and you drift forward. Think back, you drift back. Think up, you drift up.
Travis: Amazing, don't puke in the helmet though, that would be gross. (imitates puking)
Orion: Am I light enough for him to take me in?
Travis: I can't see anything. Just a cauldron on my head.
Orion: For him to carry me.
Matt: For him to carry you? Yeah, yeah.
Orion: I hop on your back. Let's go, Grog.
Travis: Great.
Marisha: I guess the rest of them are on the rug?
Travis: I can't see, so you gotta tell me. I start flying the wrong way.
Orion: Back up, the other way, other way, very good.
Matt: You actually clutch Grog by the sides of his face, and start steering him. (all laugh)
Orion: Wherever I move your head, just tilt that way.
Sam: Are we all in flight now?
Liam: We're all taken care of, yes.
Sam: And the carpet?
Liam: Tiberius, Percy, and I are on the carpet.
Sam: What about Vex? Is she with us?
Ashley: She's on the carpet.
Sam: She's staying behind.
Matt: Vex, for the time being, because it's just easier to organize for that, is coming on the carpet with you guys, and is preparing in case she is needed.
Taliesin: She's just quiet 'cause she's feeling smug about the last game.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: She's feeling smug about making another RPG right now.
Liam: She'll be back.
Sam: I wanna see how you fly, Grog.
Orion: It's really rickety!
Travis: It's one arm in and one forward. (all laugh)
Orion: Just think.
Liam: Do you propel yourself with thoughts?
Matt: It's an awkward zig zag.
Taliesin: Do you think happy thoughts?
Marisha: I'm gonna fly in the middle between Grog and the carpet, that way my Pass Without A Trace encompasses everybody.
Matt: All right.
Liam: I turn to Scanlan and say, Scanlan, we are probably going to die today. It has been an honor.
Sam: It has been an honor.
Ashley: You won't die today.
Sam: Only one of us will die. And it won't be me. I can be invisible. (all laugh)
Orion: You're not listening, it'll just happen.
Liam: What were you saying Tiberius?
Orion: Nothing.
Liam: Don't play it that way, what were you saying?
Orion: I was saying, if you're all finished, I'll just make you invisible right before it happens.
Matt: You guys are all coasting over the chasm. Now you're over the top of the large bridge, and the 200-foot-wide open hole in this tunnel that leads to the lake below. As you glance down, you can see just a little bit of a trickle from the soft red light that is deeper inside. You can see the small streams of lava, they're just slowly pooling at the bottom on the outskirts of the lake proper. As you begin to make it to the other side, you can see tiny shapes moving in this barely lit war camp of the duergar. As you're coasting over, and Clarota is along with you guys with his hood up, he kind of whispers into all of your heads, just, "Beware that some of these armies carry abominations created below within my city. I know not what to expect from them. So be wary." As this happens, everyone make a stealth check. Everyone, because of the Pass Without A Track, everyone gets a plus ten to their stealth check.
Travis: Plus ten?
Matt: Plus ten. Thanks to Keyleth.
Sam: Thank God.
Matt: Keyleth, however, you are carrying two gnomes, so you have a disadvantage on it.
Ashley: Oh no.
Liam: It's all right.
Marisha: Even with the plus 10? 18?
Matt: 18.
Sam: 15.
Taliesin: 22.
Travis: 27.
Sam: Wow.
Ashley: 23.
Liam: 28.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to crest over the very top of the war camp, and looking down you can see now, there are what looks to be the beginnings of tunneling siege engines being constructed.
Sam: What? Siege?
Matt: Siege. You can see giant wheeled carts with drills up front, giant auger bores that are being currently constructed. You can see what looks like a series of weapons being stacked at the ready. You can see there is a preparation for some sort of attack on the city above.
Liam: Want to take Kraghammer.
Matt: Continue to press ahead. There does not seem to be any reaction to your flying.
Sam: Don't say anything.
Liam: This close to the ceiling.
Ashley: Good thing we didn't cast the light.
Orion: We can all talk to each other.
Sam: Whisper to each other. Shut up!
Marisha: Oh, cool.
Sam: Just wait 'til we get there.
Matt: You guys make it towards the center portion of the city.
Travis: Roll shake it, roll shake it, roll shake it.
Taliesin: Die rolls.
Matt: You can just start beginning to see the opening in the center of this war camp. There is a circle where there are no tents constructed, you can see what looks to be a small wooden platform, and there is a stone building that is of makeshift functional construction. Not pretty, but functional, looks like a barracks, or some sort of a large bunker. Right on the northern side of that opening, that center portion of the war camp. That would be what you saw, both the general and the mind flayer head of this encampment go into last time you--
Sam: The barracks.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: With a roof?
Matt: There is a roof to it, you don't know if there's any roof access. But there is a roof.
Liam: Tiberius, can you turn me invisible now.
Orion: (sputtering)
Sam: But we're still in the air, right? He's gotta concentrate on that.
Liam: He's sitting on the carpet.
Sam: Yeah but he's--
Marisha: Thinking about--
Sam: Him flying.
Orion: I cast invisibility on you, that's when everything happens. (all laugh)
Marisha: Just falls from the air.
Liam: So are we floating above?
Matt: You guys are currently floating about 100 to 150 feet above the war camp, you do not appear to have been noticed yet.
Travis: Get down there and wing it.
Sam: Should we land on the roof? Or do we land right outside the barracks door? What do we do?
Ashley: Roof, roof, roof.
Sam: You guys wanna stay up and we'll go down?
Travis: You go! Yes.
Sam: Yeah?
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: We can start on the roof, that way that gives us time.
Liam: But I can't go invisible while you're flying.
Travis: Who needs you to be invisible? You're a stealthy bastard.
Orion: We land on the roof, we get in there, I cast Invisibility on you, and then you go do your thing.
Liam: We're running the risk of as we come down on Duergar, going (groans).
Orion: We would risk that anyway, either way.
Sam: I'm so scared right now. (all laugh)
Travis: Why don't we land on the roof and we all lay flat, except for the people that are going in, and you cast Invisibility.
Sam: This is the exact conversation they had when they were about to go kill Osama. (all laugh)
Orion: Wait, I have an idea.
Travis: Oh God.
Orion: Is there enough weight for me get on the carpet at this point?
Ashley: This is fucking stressful.
Matt: You can certainly try. There was weight, but you're not aware of how much was on it.
Orion: Yes I do, it's 1000 pounds.
Matt: You don't know how much weight is on there, total.
Orion: Everybody, how much do you weigh?
Sam: Don't ask a woman that!
Orion: I'm sorry, Your Highness, but I need to know. The idea is if, I can step off on the carpet, and hang with you guys, then Grog you can float down to the whatchamacallit, and take Vax here, then I can, oh shit, I need to be near you to cast it, damn it! (all laugh)
Marisha: Let's just land on the roof.
Ashley: Let's land on the roof.
Liam: We're gonna go in, we're gonna hit the roof, you turn me invisible, he turns him invisible, you guys light up the night, and we just do it, we just gotta go.
Ashley: We're lighting up now?
Sam: You light up on the roof? Let's look for access first. Don't light up 'til we give the go aside.
Ashley: We're still not safe stealthy.
Orion: We need to wait before we light up.
Liam: If anyone takes notice, then turn off the lights.
Sam: By the way--
Taliesin: Do not light up until you see the black or greens of their eyes.
Sam: By the way, Clarota-- Clarota you have definitely picked the right people to assist you.
Matt: There's no verbal response, but you do just emotionally sense a slight hint of regret. (all laugh)
Matt: Emanating from the mind flayer.
Sam: We got this! All right, let's go land on the roof.
Liam: All right, let's do it.
Matt: You guys descend.
Orion: Down, down.
Matt: Eagle flies down, you both, (wind rushing), as part of the landing, everyone make a secondary stealth check.
Taliesin: We still have that plus 10?
Marisha: We still have that plus 10?
Matt: You still have the spell.
Orion: Oh yes!
Marisha: Oh, that was cocked.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Oh, no!
Taliesin: You're a terrible person.
Sam: 30.
Orion: 20.
Marisha: I'm like those boobies, that crash land when they fall.
Matt: You rolled at disadvantage?
Marisha: Well, I rolled a one.
Matt: Okay. Two failures.
Taliesin: That's a 15, 29.
Travis: 23.
Ashley: 21.
Liam: 28.
Matt: Pass Without A Trace is the saving grace. A bit of a harsh landing, from your perspective, but thankfully you have two small gnomes to break your fall.
Ashley: (groan)
Sam: (groan)
Matt: You drag them a little bit across the stonework on the top. It's not stonework, actually. Most of this whole thing, is stonework, it looks like the roof of this is made of like a thick scavenged wood. Whether it was taken from the surface or from the mines itself, it is just wooden planks that are all keeping--
Ashley: Let's go in through the roof.
Taliesin: It's reclaimed, it's very nice.
Liam: If that thing sees us, though, it could be game over. I still think we should stick to the plan of blinding it.
Orion: Yeah, do it.
Sam: So some of us need to go inside.
Liam: You and I.
Travis: Yeah, the two go inside, and if shit goes down, we light it up.
Liam: I will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down, and you guys gotta pray for me.
Travis: Go find shit!
Sam: We look around for any roof access.
Travis: Come on, Chip 'n' Dale.
Matt: Looking around, there is no roof entrance. It looks like it is purely a functional roof for any weathering, rocks, you do see there are a few small rocks and pieces of cavern that may have plummeted here.
Sam: No chimneys.
Matt: No chimneys, no nothing, there doesn't appear to be a fireplace, or any sort of interior like that. Glancing over the sides, you can see that on the floor-- You can't really tell if there's two floors or not, it looks tall enough to have two floors, but you don't see a set of windows or anything that belies that to you. May just be a really tall single floor. But there are a couple of small window openings, one on each side of-- [static]
Sam: We're gonna go--
Liam: Tiberius, could you do me a favor of making me disappear?
Orion: Yes, when I do this, though, it's going to be very cool. (all laugh)
Liam: Holy shit, where are my hands?
Orion: Right?
Matt: You immediately disappear from view. You currently, visually do not exist.
Marisha: And you still have my buff.
Travis: We're like, flat on the roof, right?
Matt: You guys are all on the roof now, you're fine. Your Fly spell vanishes, you feel your weight return to you for a second. For a split moment you're a little sad, 'cause you were having fun.
Travis: Oh. (all laugh)
Travis: I was a dancer.
Sam: We can see the window, we pick one of the sides, I don't know, west side.
Matt: West side!
Sam: Is it a single pane? Is it an openable window?
Matt: As you glance over, it is just an opening. There is no glass. There is nothing blocking the way. It is about roughly big enough to fit a normal-sized half-elf or human.
Liam: I take Scanlan by the scruff, and swing him down.
Sam: Oh, I turn invisible.
Matt: As you grab him and you're bringing him down, you cast Invisibility on yourself, you both vanish now, all the rest of you are kind of holding your breath, hoping that now that you don't know what's happening, it's gonna go well.
Liam: I'm scaling in after him.
Liam: Go ahead and just make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Don't roll a one, please don't drop me.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right, yeah, you're good. You gingerly scale down the wall, the stones thankfully are just haphazardly put together, where there's enough grip space for you to catch on.
Sam: I have a climbing kit! (all laugh)
Liam: We're in, we're in.
Matt: Little late for that, but okay. (all laugh)
Matt: You lower him down, you bring him inside, you step down through the opening, into the center of the hallway.
Sam: We can't talk to each other.
Travis: Yes we get a map, finally!
Sam: We can't signal each other, and we don't know where each other is. I hold his hand. (all laugh)
Liam: We're holding hands, I'm leaning way down on the side.
Travis: 'Course you are.
Liam: Sam and I have done this before.
Orion: I use my earring.
Sam: I'm not gonna talk back to you, so whatever you say.
Orion: Just to remind you of how these particular things work, I'm not actually talking right now. So you can just talk to each other through the rings.
Matt: As the two of you step into this room, you look about you, and there are some ramshackle, makeshift beds in the room. Five to be exact, from right to left. This appears to be one portion of a barracks-type sleeping arrangement. Beds are empty, they're kind of tossed, they're not like well-kept or anything. There's sheets kind of tossed about, and it smells awful in here, but it--
Liam: First, I just heard Tiberius' voice in my head. So I'm going to test it out and think. Scanlan, can you hear me?
Sam: Can I hear him?
Matt: From?
Liam: I heard Tiberius whispering about.
Sam: From thoughts only, can I hear him?
Matt: No.
Liam: I tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks.
Sam: I notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty.
Matt: Yeah, not weirdly.
Liam: You just lean to live with the stage fright, you never move past it. Should we pause right now?
Marisha: You didn't bring your stuff?
Laura: I didn't have it!
Orion: Come on in!
Liam: Look, my sister's here.
Laura: Hello!
Liam: We'll make it work. We'll bring you up to speed later, you're on the roof of Osama Bin Laden's house. (all laugh)
Liam: So question for the DM, I'm invisible. Do I need to stealth, do I stealth?
Matt: There's still a stealth check 'cause you're invisible, but noise is still a factor. You just have advantage on your stealth check.
Liam: So, I think we should probably stealth. And start moving in.
Sam: Yeah, that's, we tug each other.
Matt: Beyond being invisible, you guys make your stealth check.
Sam: I mean, I'm invisible, and I rolled a five.
Matt: You have an advantage, you roll twice. 'Cause you're both invisible.
Sam: 13.
Liam: 20.
Matt: All right. You both feel you're stealthed, there is one opening into a hallway here.
Liam: We have, does anyone have a laser light?
Travis: Yep.
Liam: All right.
Travis: Squeeze it together. Press the little button.
Liam: Squeeze it together? Ah, there we go. Okay so we're going to go down here.
Matt: Down to this one. As you guys step out, you can see immediately there are two duergar guards right by a door that leads to a central chamber.
Liam: So we're gonna go this way.
Matt: All right. Immediately you see--
Travis: I like how you guys have different-colored lightsabers.
Matt: Two more Duergar guards.
Travis: (lightsaber noises)
Liam: All right, I'm inching up, I'm pulling Scanlan behind me, but I'm inching up to this door, just peeking through, seeing what I can see.
Matt: Okay, looking inside, you can see these small symbols, basically just red stone, the glow stone, that lights the underground caverns here and in a large portion of Kraghammer, are just embedded in the wall in a small sconce. Peering through here, you see one against the wall, you also see along the edges here, what looks to be racks of spears and pikes and hammers and various war accoutrements of weapons, just hanging, and there's a set of armor, over a small, wooden arrangement, the armor itself is just being stored there. This looks to be like a fast-grab armory.
Liam: Okay. I pull Scanlan by the hand, and we enter into this room.
Sam: This is so romantic.
Liam: It's just like the day we met, Sam.
Matt: You guys enter.
Liam: Quietly walking this way. We're past the door, that looks like the front door.
Matt: It is the front door, it is currently closed, though.
Liam: We're gonna keep going this way.
Sam: Oh man, we're doing-- we're flanking!
Matt: Just come out this way. There is one duergar here. There doesn't appear to be a doorway or entrance to the central chamber on this side of the hallway.
Sam: That's pretty good.
Liam: I still have the pitch in a bucket. The shit in a bucket in my hand, by the way.
Sam: We can take these guys, I'm not worried about that.
Liam: But we'd make noise. How far apart are the two duergar standing in that door?
Matt: They're about five feet apart, just enough space, like one is on each side of the doorway.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: Wait. What are those red things right there?
Matt: Those are the small sconces with the glow stone, the red stone that lights the--
Sam: So we're trying to get there.
Orion: -- with Greater Invisibility, so you can attack, and you'll still be invisible.
Liam: I pull a gold coin out of my pocket, and throw it in this corner.
Sam: This is straight up Metal Gear. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and just make a general dexterity check.
Liam: And because of Keyleth, I have advantage, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Orion: Sure do.
Liam: So this is, what is this?
Matt: Just a dexterity modifier.
Liam: So that's a 17.
Matt: All right, you-- (coin ringing) Ringing sound, both of the duergar kinda look over. They look at each other. Grunt for a second. This one nods her head and begins walking over to inspect it, this one stays at its post.
Marisha: (Metal Gear voice) Must have been my imagination. (all laugh)
Liam: I pull Scanlan behind me, and tiptoe right behind this asshole.
Travis: Do it! Put it in him!
Liam: And take out my vorpal blade. And reach out and grab him by the hair and stick it in the back of his neck.
Sam: You got my dice.
Matt: All right, so, as you reach up, you grasp the back of this really nasty, wiry, thick duergar hair--
Liam: I'm so tense right now.
Matt: You yank the head back, and take the base of the blade, go ahead and make an attack roll. It's a surprise roll, so you have an advantage on the attack.
Liam: Okay, good.
Matt: I believe you have a bonus too, if you get the attack.
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Sneak attack?
Liam: Well, I get-- Yes, I get advantage, but you can't triple up on advantage I believe? (loud bang offscreen)
Sam: What was that?
Matt: That was to freak you out. All right, so just double-checking here as part of your ability.
Sam: Remember every 50 subscribers gets a free giveaway.
Orion: Subscribe now, kids.
Ashley: What is that smile?
Matt: If you score it, and the creature is surprised, it is a critical hit, that's the other thing I was going to mention.
Liam: Thank you. So this isn't a dexterity check, this is an attack.
Matt: This is an attack.
Liam: Okay. So that's a 26.
Matt: That is going to hit, and that is a critical hit. Go ahead and roll damage with Sneak Attack.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Laura: Die die die.
Liam: I'm sweating. Okay, that's two plus seven is nine. That's nine, that's just that part. Six. Seven. Nine. 14. And 19. Which is, what's doubled, the Sneak Attack damage?
Matt: The Sneak Attack damage and the dice damage.
Matt: And the dice damage, 19 plus, is 26, 52.
Marisha: Oh!
Taliesin: Whoa!
Matt: As you pull the head back, you can hear a slight, a slight (gurgles) is about as much noise as can make it out before the blade just, right out the front of its throat, blocking any passage of the air. As you hold it, you twist the blade, it goes limp in your hand, but you catch it and keep holding it there, so it doesn't make any noise. You're now clutching a dead duergar.
Sam: Easy, easy.
Ashley: (shushes) Night-night.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Travis: Lean him up against the wall! Like he's standing there.
Liam: Just had a thought, I'm going to sit him back against the wall, and let him slide against it, and grab Scanlan, and into the room.
Matt: Into this room?
Marisha: There's Scanlan.
Taliesin: He's still standing up, kind of.
Laura: Why is he leading Scanlan, what's happening?
Liam: (shushes)
Sam: While I'm invisible, I look around for traps. I'm just gonna see if there's any trap doors.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Sam: Not great?
Liam: I got a 28.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: You notice no traps. What you do notice, though, is there a giant kind of war room table, at the top of this raised platform. It's about six feet up, and there's a stairway that leads up to it. You see at the table. One of the illithid mind flayers. The armored general that you saw before. And there are two other duergar currently at the table.
Travis: Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Ashley: Stay invisible.
Sam: We can't communicate.
Travis: You guys have got seconds until that other guard comes back.
Liam: We can't talk.
Matt: You hear footsteps behind you.
Liam: I put the bucket of shit into Scanlan's hands.
Laura: What are you doing?
Liam: Give him a little nudge, a gentle little nudge.
Sam: I step forward into the room, and I hurl it at the fucker's face. The mind controllers.
Liam: And I'm rolling behind him at the same time. Behind the illithid, ready to go.
Matt: So I'll say you go up here as well?
Liam: Oh yeah, behind him, behind him.
Laura: What is happening?
Matt: Make a stealth check, both of you.
Travis: Oh God, oh God. Oh God, over extended.
Sam: Wait, do we get the plus ten to stealth?
Matt: No.
Liam: Plus advantage, oh thank christ.
Sam: 19.
Liam: Using Scanlan's advantage, so 16, 29. (sighs)
Matt: Okay. You slink up behind, seemingly unnoticed. There's a slight twitch to the mind flayer's head, for a second, as you go ahead, and take a big ol'--
Sam: Bucket of shit!
Matt: And fling it. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make an attack roll. It would be, you're not proficient with goblin shit buckets, unfortunately, so go ahead and roll a d20, and add your dexterity.
Orion: (groans)
Sam: My dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity or strength, whichever's higher, strength higher?
Sam: No, no, strength is not higher for me. Oh, it is higher! So 19.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Oh my God.
Matt: You fling it as the Invisibility spell wears off of you as part of the attack, you fling the bucket. A spray of thick, green, goblin fecal matter goes streaking through the air as the illithid turns, its eyes wide, to see you suddenly appear, and then suddenly see this entire batch of thick goblin shit just (splashes) across its face. Suddenly you see his tentacles writhing, as it screams, all of you hear in your head a scream.
Liam: I'm stabbing, I'm stabbing!
Orion: I cast Stoneskin immediately.
Matt: As this happens, you cast Stoneskin, you go in for the blade, and you hear a counter voice in your mind.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: Clarota going, "Now."
Marisha: I cast Light on Grog's head!
Matt: Your head comes to an extremely bright glow, all of you averting your gaze.
Liam: This is stealth, right? Stealth for me?
Matt: No, you're invisible.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Sam: Attack, attack, kill him!
Liam: 29! 29!
Matt: That definitely rolls to hit, you have surprise. Go ahead and roll.
Liam: That's a critical, right? I'm assassinating this mother fucker.
Matt: It's a critical, technically. Yep.
Sam: We're going for the general?
Liam: The illithid can control us all.
Ashley: Should we go in?
Orion: We don't know anything.
Matt: So, roll damage on this.
Liam: Roll my damage.
Orion: We just heard a scream. Oh, we can act on that.
Travis: And I rage.
Matt: Stone skin. Light on his head.
Travis: Rage.
Matt: Going into a rage.
Ashley: Daylight on my shield.
Matt: Daylight on your shield.
Laura: I'm so happy to be here. (all laugh)
Matt: I will say for the purposes of this battle, there is no Trinket here, because Trinket would not have fit across the way to get there.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Didn't you give her an arrow?
Taliesin: Yes, and you have an entrapment arrow now.
Laura: Okay, I get ready for that.
Liam: Okay, DM? 62 into the back of his head.
Taliesin: Oh, shit!
Travis: 62?
Ashley: How?
Liam: Critical hit.
Matt: You take the blade, and as it pierces the back--
Liam: Oh, it's a poison one by the way.
Orion: Damn!
Matt: It pierces the back of its skull, you feel the muscles in its neck tense in reaction to the blade, but the blade slips past. You can see a gout of purplish-black blood begin to spill from its neck, as it instinctually reaches up, and pulls the blade from the back of its head. What's the DC on the poison?
Liam: I have no idea.
Matt: It should be on the blade info.
Liam: Poison dagger.
Taliesin: Fuck. Ah!
Liam: I think it's oh, it's 15.
Taliesin: This was a good plan.
Matt: The poison does not seem to take effect, the body resists it. It is still alive. But it's clutching the back of its neck, as it turns around going (sputters), you can see its blood spurting out of its mouth, and its eyes are now just burning with rage. All the rest of these duergar are now reaching and pulling their weapons out. Everyone roll initiative. (all yell)
Laura: I don't have my stuff with me.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Oh, shit.
Sam: Let's kill some bad guys.
Travis: I don't know what you're doing.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Liam: 20. Natural 20.
Matt: But you have no bonuses? You should have your dex bonus too.
Liam: Oh yeah, that's a 25.
Matt: So, I'm gonna say you're probably going in first, buddy.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: All right, 20, 25 to 20, anyone else?
Laura: Oh, I think I got like a 21.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I got 16 plus--
Matt: Yep, that'd be 21, yeah. All right, so. 19, anyone?
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, nice.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Gonna wing it.
Matt: 18, anyone?
Travis: 18.
Matt: Nice.
Orion: I got 16.
Marisha: Do you have like a picture, or a file anywhere, saved of your--
Laura: I got jack shit!
Marisha: Of your sheet?
Liam: We snuck into the war camp.
Laura: We're in the war camp?
Liam: We all landed on the top of their main building.
Matt: So, what's your?
Sam: 14.
Orion: I have 16.
Matt: 16, all right, so Tiberius. Scanlan, what was yours?
Ashley: Nine.
Marisha: Also nine.
Ashley: Not to brag.
Travis: Ashley's first two rolls were 20s.
Matt: All right, top of the round is Vax, with initiative.
Liam: I'm just gonna (grunts) in the back of his head some more. I'm still invisible according to Tiberius' Greater Invisibility spell.
Orion: No no no, as soon as I cast Stoneskin, you were attacking, that's why I said this is all going--
Matt: You are now visible, you are not stealthed.
Liam: Stab him in the back of the head. For assassinate, do I get the critical still here, DM?
Matt: No. You've gotten the one hit, it is completely aware of you, it is not a surprise attack.
Liam: So this is a 28.
Matt: It is so aware of you, it has never been more aware of you in its life. (all laugh)
Liam: I just rolled a 28.
Matt: Okay, that definitely hits. Attacking with your off hand?
Liam: Oh, so this is my bonus attack?
Matt: Yeah, you get the one attack, then you get the bonus hand. Which is just dice damage.
Liam: Okay, this is fire. My flame tongue dagger, I got two plus six is eight.
Matt: Eight?
Liam: Eight.
Matt: All right. And your other attack? Are you doing your bonus attack?
Liam: Was that the bonus attack? Or was that my main attack?
Matt: This is your new combat round, that was your main attack.
Liam: That's a nine, and here comes my bonus attack. Okay, 14.
Marisha: Kill him.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Here comes my keen dagger. Which is an eight.
Matt: Eight damage?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So the first strike, you swing across with the flame tongue dagger. As it backs up, you put another gash across the front of its neck and chest area. It reels back and is looking at you with angry fury. You feel this coming shake, this horrible force of severe retribution coming to your mind, and as you're bracing for it, you take your other blade, you see its mouth opens up with frustration and anger as its tentacles kinda curl back, and just go in for the grab. You place the blade squarely into that maw, you feel the scraping of its teeth across your knuckles, but it doesn't matter, because whatever anger and light was once in its face, goes dark and dull. (all cheer)
Matt: As immediately it crumples to the ground, lifeless, pull the blade from the maw, mind flayer down. (all cheer)
Marisha: Yeah Vax!
Matt: He was next, but not anymore. As it falls to the ground, all the rest of the duergar immediately have a reaction. We'll get to their turn in a second. Vex, you're up. So you're on the roof, up here right now.
Sam: Gotta get inside first.
Laura: We have to run down in?
Matt: Run down, you're on a wooden roof surface, you heard before there's an entrance here, and an entrance there.
Liam: Windows are swing-down-in-able.
Sam: Unless Grog can just tear through the roof.
Laura: What was your initiative?
Liam: It's wood.
Taliesin: You can hold initiative.
Laura: I guess I'll hold, I'll hold, to see what the hell's happening.
Matt: So you hold on that. It is now this dude's turn, the general. He, unaffected by this, it seems, just angrily leaps on to the table, runs across, (groans), and jumps down towards you. As he does, you see his physical form seems to enlarge. His actual small dwarvish form begins to swell, his muscles tense. He's about the size of a normal person, if not a little bigger right now. He comes at you with this giant black, jagged metal war hammer. (groans) Comes down to swing at you, as he comes down, you see it burst into flame. There's fire now surrounding the head of this war hammer as it arcs toward you.
Sam: What?
Matt: That is going to be a 24 to hit.
Liam: Oh, it hits, but I use Uncanny Dodge to try to swoop out of the way as best I can.
Matt: All righty. You suffer-- That would be... 12 plus six fire damage, so, 18, reduced to nine. You take nine damage from the strike. As it strikes down, it goes for a back swing to attack you a second time. That is going to be a 15 versus AC. This time you just dodge completely out of the way. Derge out of the way.
Marisha: Derge.
Liam: Er mah gerd, I derged. (all laugh)
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Just in case, I'm going to push off and wait for Grog. So I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay, Grog, your turn.
Travis: Right, so we're on the roof of the thing, right?
Matt: Correct, you are.
Travis: I'm in a rage, I take the pot still on my head, and I pick up my ax, and I draw one gigantic smash through the roof of the building.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Taliesin: God, yes.
Orion: This is all you're good for.
Marisha: Yes, come on Grog. This is all you're good for.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Come on.
Sam: 15?
Matt: You bring your ax up, you bring it down on top as hard as you can, go ahead and roll ax damage.
Travis: Is that a d12?
Matt: It's a d12 plus your strength modifier. Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Do I get advantage on that?
Matt: No.
Travis: Seven.
Laura: Plus two 'cause you're raging.
Travis: Nine.
Matt: Nine damage, okay. As you swing the ax down, slam, it hits the wood. With the sheer weight of you there, and most of you guys conglomerated at that point, the actual roof breaks open and splits, into a small space. You slide down in the process.
Ashley: I jump on to Grog's foot. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. Go ahead, both of you make an acrobatics check.
Ashley: Oh, I wouldn't have had to do it. All right, well, I'm in the building.
Travis: 21.
Matt: Acrobatics check?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Pike? You have disadvantage 'cause you're in plate armor.
Ashley: Six.
Matt: All right, so Grog, you manage to land on your feet. Pike, you actually plummet off and fall off to the side, right there. You are currently prone, and from the fall, which you guys both dropped down, you managed to reduce the damage, but you from the fall, you take eight points of fall damage. You are now flat on your back, the wind knocked out of you for a minute.
Sam: Pike!
Ashley: I'm okay, I'm okay!
Sam: Oh okay, thank God.
Matt: All right. That brings us now, Vex and Percy are the same.
Taliesin: You first? Or should I go first?
Laura: Let's go down at the same time.
Taliesin: We'll go, we both jump down at the same time.
Matt: Both jump down, go ahead and make your acrobatics checks, guys.
Taliesin: 20.
Laura: Oh, I rolled really bad.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: I rolled a two, but I add it to my acrobatics.
Matt: Yes, which is?
Sam: Which you don't know.
Laura: Which is like, I bet.
Matt: Your acrobatics, as you're proficient in it, and you have plus five dex, so that would bring it to 11?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Or no, 12.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: Did you bring any Wheaton power from the other room? (all laugh)
Matt: You just barely land on your feet, you do take fall damage, but you don't fall prone. You take eight points of fall damage. Percy, you manage to land fine, without any damage, on your feet. On the ground, both of you kind of three-point landing. Avengers style.
Taliesin: Do I have time to get a shot off?
Matt: You do, that was your movement. So what's the deal?
Taliesin: Wow, I'm taking a second, and I see that Vax is getting attacked, and I'm gonna just take a shot at the-- The guy with the hammer. The biggest thing I see.
Matt: Do you have your glasses or goggles on?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's right, I have a helmet. So yeah, I'm wearing the helmet. I'm cool with that.
Matt: So go for it.
Liam: Do it, Starlord.
Taliesin: Ah! A natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Against the general, or one of the duergar?
Taliesin: The general.
Liam: The guy on the table attacking me.
Matt: Yeah, you can just barely see him, the stairway is up there.
Taliesin: Doesn't matter, as long as I have-- partial cover, it don't matter.
Matt: Right, I know, and he does have, he has three-quarters cover because of the distance, but you natural 20'd, so it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: I can ignore it, I ignore three-quarters cover.
Matt: You do, because--
Taliesin: I'm awesome.
Matt: Yep. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So that's double 1d-- I should have gotten some bonuses on that, I'm an idiot. Plus five. It's just double dice damage?
Matt: Double dice damage, then add your modifier.
Marisha: Woo!
Taliesin: That's 19 points of damage.
Matt: To the general, nice.
Marisha: Nice.
Matt: (explosion) He gets shot in the back of the shoulderplate, you hear it ricochet and a little bit of blood begins to streak off the back of his head. He looks over his shoulder with an angry grunt, you can see now this dwarf, who's still swelling in size. It looks, (growls), an angry nostril flare. You, have your bow ready?
Laura: I wanna do Lightning Arrow on the guy attacking my brother.
Matt: That guy there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll to attack.
Laura: Ugh, I don't think I hit.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Laura: I had rolled a four.
Matt: A four, you had a plus 11 to hit, it's going to be a 15, unfortunately you miss. The arrow streaks past. Yeah, the arrow just ended up striking the wall back here and (explosion) arcs lightning throughout the wall, unfortunately does not--
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him anyway, just for future stuff.
Matt: You used your--
Laura: That was a bon--
Matt: You used your bonus action to cast Lightning Arrow.
Laura: Oh! So I get a regular attack now?
Matt: Well, that was part of your regular attack, like your next arrow you fired.
Laura: I get it. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You're going off-book, this is cool.
Matt: I think, let me double-check real fast, just to be sure. Because I don't wanna screw you out of a cool turn.
Laura: That is mine!
Matt: Next time bring your sheet.
Laura: I'm sorry.
Matt: That's okay. Yeah that's a bonus action to cast lightning, into your next arrow you fire, however, you do have two attacks. So you can shoot a second time. It just isn't affected by Lightning Arrow.
Laura: I roll 14.
Matt: That does hit, go ahead and roll damage there's 1d10, plus--
Laura: I think it was 1d8, actually.
Matt: Oh, for the longbow? Okay, 1d8 plus five for your dex, and then plus two for the bow. Plus seven.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Ten damage, all right. So first arrow just streaks off, hits the wall. As he's kind of staring at Percy, he looks towards you, and as he does, the second arrow sticks into the plate, he kinda looks at it. (grunts) Just snaps it off in the armor. Grabbing his two-handed sword, or sorry, the war hammer in the other hand. Minis, it's confusing. All right, that ends your turn. Grog, the light that is beaming from your helmet currently right now is filling up the room, and it is extremely bright, most of you guys can handle it. You see all the duergar at the table like (groans), bunch of duergar come running in as well, as they run in, they're having to shield their eyes, but it's actually physically hurting them to be in that room right now. They're like (groans). Keeping it at bay, this one attempts to run in, this one's kind of making its way over. These guys here, this one's gonna go ahead and run here, this one's gonna go ahead and come to Grog. These two are gonna come up behind.
Sam: Is that guy the general?
Matt: That guy's the general, yes. This one's gonna come up behind to you. All right, they have disadvantage on their attacks.
Orion: Nice.
Matt: Because of the light. (all cheer)
Travis: 'Cause I'm so bright.
Matt: Attack against you.
Marisha: You're the brightest tool in the shed today.
Matt: That is a 17 versus AC. You just dodge out of the way. Next one, its war pick against you, Grog.
Ashley: Get skinny, get skinny.
Matt: That is 20 versus AC?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: That hits, all right. You take eight points of damage as it slams you with its war pick in the chest, you can feel it kind of gets about a half an inch of depth into it, but you just kind of shrug it off, and flex your muscles and it pops it out of your torso.
Travis: That's cute.
Matt: The two against you. That'll be a 19 versus AC.
Laura: Oh, yeah, that hits for sure.
Matt: And a 17 versus AC.
Laura: That-- hits.
Matt: All right, so you take two hits. That's 11 damage. And 13 damage as both of them start whaling you from behind with war picks.
Liam: Vex'ahlia! I yell.
Laura: 13 and what?
Matt: All right. Next up is the one that's attacking you.
Sam: Scanlan.
Matt: Scanlan, that's going to be, at a disadvantage, a 15 versus armor class.
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14? That still strikes you. You take eight points of damage from the war pick. Slamming you over the shoulder.
Sam: (yells out) Ah, I'm so awesome, Pike! (all laugh)
Matt: That ends their go, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm still on the roof, right?
Matt: You're still on the roof, yes.
Orion: What can I see, like if I go down, what can I see?
Matt: You look through the hole, and you can see pretty much the entire battlefield. You're just up here looking down through it.
Orion: Oh, wonderful.
Matt: You're currently the only one still up there.
Orion: Yes, I think I'll stay right here, thank you very much. And how tall is the roof? How high is it? 15 feet?
Matt: It's about 25 feet up?
Orion: Okay, wonderful, wonderful. So, let me see here. This is fun.
Matt: You are technically, because I can do it.
Taliesin: Gonna use one of the little lifties, aren't you?
Matt: I am.
Marisha: Finally.
Liam: Bring the fire, Tiberus.
Sam: Oh. Toys.
Marisha: Now he's getting out toys.
Taliesin: Aw yeah.
Sam: Come on, do something.
Orion: I'm waiting for him to do something, 'cause it's so cool.
Marisha: I got him this for Christmas two years ago, and he's finally using it.
Matt: You are up here right now.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: Three-dimensional fighting.
Liam: Toys, toys.
Matt: Is that visible?
Taliesin: Yeah. Sweet D&D rave.
Orion: Okay. I'm going to-- I see the two guards behind Vex, right? Is that what's going on?
Matt: Yep, right there.
Orion: And then the one duergar in front of Grog? Is that what's going on, too?
Matt: Yep, right there. Great, I will cast Grand Columns under all three of those dudes, and pin 'em. Right up against the roof. With my columns.
Liam: Clever girl.
Matt: The?
Orion: Pillars, yes.
Matt: But those pillars only go 15 feet up.
Orion: No, they go up to 25.
Matt: 25? Oh nice.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: That's why I always ask that question. It does 66 bludgeoning damage when it's pinned.
Ashley: Bye bye.
Sam: If they don't make their save.
Matt: All right, so. Go ahead and what is your DC on that? Your spell DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: 17, all right. All right, the heartiness of the duergar resilience gives them advantage on saves against spells. They all make their saves.
Sam: What?
Matt: But they are still up on these platforms now, raised above. So what is-- Does it do any damage if they make their saves?
Orion: (reading)
Sam: Come on iPhone, come on iphone!
Marisha: You're supposed to know everything!
Sam: iPhone five! This is the Fifth Edition.
Orion: Why doesn't it say? I guess it doesn't. It doesn't say.
Matt: So they are currently--
Sam: What is this madness?
Taliesin: Oh, you're crazy.
Orion: Oh, wait a minute, no. You make this call. If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 66 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a strength or dexterity check against the spell save DC. On a success they are no longer restrained, and must either move off the pole, or fall off of it. So they still, it still happens, but they're not pinned by it. Got you, okay. So go ahead and roll damage for all of them.
Marisha: Woo!
Matt: Good to know. (sings) New spells that just got released.
Liam: There's magic in the dwarves.
Sam: Magic in them.
Liam: The duergar.
Marisha: ♫ A whole new spell
Taliesin: ♫ A fantastic way to die
Marisha: ♫ No one can tell us no
Orion: 27 damage.
Marisha: ♫ Except for Matt (all laugh)
Matt: All three of the duergar are crushed.
Sam: To death?
Matt: Against the ceiling.
Orion: I did 27 damage to each one.
Travis: Nice!
Matt: Splat, splat, splat, they're all slammed into the ceiling, you can see limp dwarf arms and legs now dangling out of the stone pillars that are now permanently embedding them into the ceiling.
Liam: Yeah, son.
Sam: Crazy room!
Orion: I go like this, hah! I use two of my sorcerer points, and I cast Quicken Spell, and I look at the general, and I-- Because of my books I've been tampering with, I cast Blight on his eyes. Okay. 'Cause I wanna. (all laugh)
Matt: What's the-- the DC is 17, you said?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: All right, natural 20. So he makes his save. (all groan)
Orion: He takes 8d8 damage, and if he saves, he takes half the damage.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: 10, 15.
Liam: They were all eights, right?
Marisha: Well, he does all of them and then divides.
Sam: But you said half.
Marisha: He rolls all of them and then divides.
Sam: I see.
Orion: 15 plus, what is that, ten, 14.
Marisha: Your first one was--
Orion: 29?
Matt: So we'll say a solid 14 points of damage. All right, gotcha. No other effect, just the damage from Blight, right?
Orion: Yeah, because he made his save.
Matt: All right, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Oh, okay. I'm going to, (groans). God there's so few people to kill now. (all laugh)
Sam: You did it all, is it just us and the general?
Laura: Wait, that guy behind you though.
Matt: Just you guys, the general. There's a guy right behind you. Those guys got slammed.
Sam: Okay, I'm gonna cast Dominate Person on the general.
Travis: (laughs) What does that do?
Orion: Oh shit.
Taliesin: No.
Liam: He's a power top.
Matt: With advantage, he rolled a one and a two, on the saving throw. (all cheer)
Matt: That's ridiculous, okay.
Sam: I'm going to Dominate him and inform him, I can give him a command, right? Yes.
Orion: You can make him do whatever.
Sam: I'm going to tell him to stand down, and tell all of his allies to stand down.
Matt: All right. He turns around. Gives you a look, a strange look, he goes. "Men, all of you, drop your weapons! Now. We are surrendering to our new infiltrators." He throws his war hammer to the ground. The rest of them all kind of look around. Go ahead and, I'm gonna have you make intimidation check on his behalf.
Sam: Okay, on his behalf?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Do I add mine?
Matt: No, I'm just considering that, so you rolled 11?
Sam: 11. (sings along with the music)
Matt: The three other duergar look confused, look at the dead mind flayer, look at their general telling them to surrender, and they all kinda throw their weapons to the ground, and stand there with their arms to the side, kind of waiting for what's gonna happen next. As you finish that, Clarota slowly drifts down.
Sam: Oh yeah, Clarota, thanks for all the fucking help. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no. This is gonna be bad.
Matt: Clarota just kinda looks around. Says, you hear this voice in your mind go, "I had my doubts, but, well done."
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: So. That ends that turn. Scanlan, do you want to move at all? Are you going to stay where you are?
Sam: I'm gonna stay where, well, I'm gonna move just a couple feet away from the guy right behind me, and I'm going to, as my bonus action, might as well give Grog some dice. And also just tell everyone, remember, let's not kill the general, we need him for information.
Liam: Probably if anyone tries to hit him, he'll snap out of it, so.
Sam: That's it. I also take a little poo in my pants.
Taliesin: Small kilo.
Sam: This is still-- A battle? Even though. No combatants?
Matt: I mean, if you guys are deciding not to fight anymore, what's your plan?
Marisha: I-- Come on down and I say, good work guys. That was cool, that was great.
Sam: He's under my spell.
Laura: Perhaps we should tie him up.
Marisha: That's what I was gonna say, I cast Grasping Vine and I just take a vine and I tie his hands behind his back. And kind of grapple him.
Sam: So that'll break the spell.
Marisha: Well no, I'm not damaging him, I'm just--
Liam: Hugging him.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Hugging him with vines.
Taliesin: Vine hugs.
Matt: As this is happening, you guys feel a familiar tremble.
Sam: Oh no. Be quiet.
Matt: In the ground.
Liam: DM is out of his mind.
Matt: Everyone make a stealth check. (all laugh)
Marisha: Damn it.
Orion: Oh, that's a 20.
Sam: That is a 20.
Marisha: (whimpers) This is the second time I rolled a one on my stealth check.
Taliesin: Wow.
Marisha: I'm not stealthy today.
Ashley: 17.
Liam: 18.
Laura: 19.
Travis: 14.
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: Pretty good overall.
Orion: Two.
Sam: 22.
Matt: All right. There is the rumble, gets louder and louder, and you can see the duergar looking around nervously. The rumbling kind of fades for a second. And with a cacophonous cracking sound, the stone floor beneath you splits open.
Sam: No!
Matt: Right here.
Liam: (groans)
Matt: Percy, make an acrobatics check and try to avoid whatever is coming through.
Sam: Whatever? It's a dragon!
Taliesin: 18.
Liam: It's a worm.
Matt: All right, you manage to just pull out of the way. As a large--
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: A large armored four-legged creature comes bursting out of the ground around you.
Orion: Oh great, it's a rock butthole. (all laugh)
Matt: Lets out this horrible screeching growl, has this kind of hungry look in its eyes.
Marisha: Can I reactionary real quick, take my Grasping Vine and just lift him and kind of put him in the corner to keep the general safe?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Orion: Is he rooted?
Matt: He is currently-- Is considered grappled.
Liam: I have a question.
Marisha: I was just trying to keep him safe.
Liam: Can we take a potty break before?
Sam: A potty break? No breaks tonight!
Liam: No breaks?
Marisha: No breaks.
Matt: We're pushing through. You need a bottle.
Marisha: Exercise your kegels.
Matt: If you really need to go, you can. When it's not your turn.
Liam: No, I'm fine.
Sam: Just pee on Ashley, it's okay.
Crew: Suck it up, man.
Matt: As this entity comes burrowing up from underneath the ground, it immediately makes a strike against--
Sam: Guys, this is so exciting. And Laura has no idea what's going on.
Laura: No clue, good times.
Matt: This is gonna be a bite attack against you, Percy. That is, all right, 24 versus armor class.
Travis: Shit, bite is at 24.
Taliesin: Yeah, that-- That hits.
Matt: As you reactively attempt to move out of the way, this creature comes tearing out of the ground. Gets its bearings, rears back, and this giant, toothy maw comes clamping down onto your entire torso. You suffer 36 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Oh!
Taliesin: The fuck?
Marisha: 36?
Matt: 36 points of piercing damage. That's going to end its turn.
Marisha: Shit.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay, well.
Taliesin: That hurt.
Ashley: I'm still prone?
Matt: You are prone, you can use your movement to get back up.
Ashley: Okay, I use my movement to get back up. Do I also get an attack for doing that?
Matt: You still have your action, and your bonus action, it's just your move.
Ashley: Okay. I will use Guiding Bolt, and I'm gonna shoot that thing.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for the attack.
Sam: That's my girlfriend.
Travis: Come on, Pike.
Marisha: Does this guy appear to be messed up by the Daylight at all?
Ashley: Okay. Do I add anything?
Matt: You add your spell attack modifier, it's on your spell sheet. So the top of your spell sheet.
Ashley: Sorry guys. Oh sweet, okay, so. That would be 25.
Matt: That definitely hits. So, Guiding Bolt, what does that do?
Ashley: So I roll, where'd it go, I roll 4d6. I roll 4d6.
Matt: 4d6, go ahead and do that.
Ashley: Yes. 16.
Matt: 16, all right. So you reach back, clutching your holy symbol. You get back off the ground, release your hand as this suddenly flaring blast of divine energy comes cascading out of the front of your palm, blasting into the side of the face, nearly searing one of the eyes of the creature. It rears back, brings one leg up instinctually, (growls) slams the ground in the process-- How you doing? That's disadvantage to your next attack.
Liam: Aw!
Ashley: Wait, what are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 38.
Matt: It lands, puts its foot back on the ground, and kinda gears its attention towards you. It's angling around the room for what should be its next meal. Anything else you wanna do?
Ashley: Can I give him a healing potion? Can I heal him?
Matt: He's too far away. You could use your bonus action if you wanna use Healing Word.
Ashley: Okay, I'll use Healing Word.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and roll that for him. While you're doing that, brings us-- So Clarota now gets its action.
Marisha: Yeah, Clarota!
Matt: Clarota now looks wide-eyed, seeing this happen. You hear a slight voice in the back of your head go, "This is complicating." As it rears back, you hear the slight echoing, screeching sound, that just manages to skirt the outside of your mental capacity. You feel like if you were any closer, or if it was directed towards you, it would be a horrible ringing pain in your head. You're just peripheral to it. It makes its attack. Unfortunately, the exterior, the bulette, and/or its mind shielding is too strong, it seems to have no effect on the creature.
Sam: Damn it! Clarota, worthless!
Matt: A bulette, is the entity. That ends its turn, top of the round, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I think, where's the laser? Here it is. It looks like I have just enough squares to go one two three. Who's this right here?
Matt: That's a duergar. Weapon on the ground, not armed right now.
Liam: Can I get to here on a turn? I can't tell.
Matt: What's your movement?
Liam: It's 30 feet. I'll use my bonus action to click my haste boots together.
Matt: Okay, then you can definitely do that.
Liam: Okay, and since Percy is right up against it, I'm able to deal Sneak Attack damage, because there's another one of its foes.
Matt: Exactly, yes. You don't get an advantage on the attack, but if you attack, you do it.
Liam: So I'm gonna try to strike him in his underbelly.
Matt: All right. Even the underbelly itself is heavily armored, you have to kind of gauge quickly where the plate is.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20? 20 hits.
Matt: Go ahead and roll with your Sneak Attack damage.
Marisha: So 20 hits?
Liam: Oh, and it was-- Never mind. So three. There we go. 22.
Matt: 22 damage? All righty. Got it. Cool, that brings us to-- The general is going to attempt to make a saving throw.
Sam: Shit. He can do that?
Matt: Every time he gets a turn round, he gets a chance to break out of the-- And he does.
Sam: Oh, he broke out?
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Shrugs off the mental influence of the Dominate spell. However, he is not currently armed. He uses his movement, or action to pick up the war hammer. Fury and anger is in his eyes.
Marisha: He's still grappled.
Sam: No no, he just broke out, right?
Marisha: Oh, from the grapple, too?
Matt: Yeah, he used his whole turn to break out of the grapple and grab its weapon, that's all he can do.
Sam: Where is he?
Matt: Right there.
Liam: To fight the bulette? Or to--
Matt: You have no idea.
Liam: Oh, we don't know, oh. He could just be reacting to the bulette.
Matt: The flames on the hammer are out too. But it picks up the war hammer, it's cold black steel currently.
Travis: We got our Davy Jones in the room, he'll take care of the dwarves.
Matt: That brings us to... Grog.
Travis: (groans) Kitty! I would like to go into a frenzied rage, and charge at Clifford the big red dog. (all alguH)
Matt: You leap off the higher platofrm, come rushing out with your ax in the air, as you come down using the full weight of your body behind the attack, go ahead and roll your three attacks.
Travis: All right, I have nine, eight, 17.
Sam: You have one dice from me. I've inspired you.
Travis: Oh.
Sam: (singing) Grog. Grog.
Travis: Is it a 20 or is it a what?
Matt: You get to add a d8 to an attack roll.
Sam: If you have a shitty attack roll, add a d8 to it, if you have a shitty roll.
Travis: 17.
Orion: Grog, smash right through his plate thingy.
Matt: Barely hits.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Hits, all three attacks hit.
Travis: Yeah, that one hits, 16 plus eight.
Matt: So all three attacks hit, roll damage for three hits. As you come now, just slamming your grey ax, into the side of this armored beast, just over and over again. Cleaving this nice little wide section of its armor on the side.
Liam: Take his fucking head off.
Travis: 14. 21. 21 again.
Ashley: What?
Travis: 22.
Laura: Oh, so. 22, 21, and 14.
Sam: Whoa.
Laura: I was doing his math. (all laugh)
Matt: 21, 22, and 14 you said?
Ashley: 57?
Sam: 57.
Travis: I don't wanna do math and show you all up.
Liam: That's a level nine barbarian.
Matt: So, slam him, you see a portion of its side armor splits, you can see a little bit of that dark red, fleshy interior. You do a significant amount of damage, and leave a nice little weak point in its armor. However, it still doesn't seem to be entirely phased by the damage, it just kinda shrugs at the damage, and kinda glares at you for a second. One of its eyes that was focused on Percy and Keyleth, now looks over at you Jurassic-Park style, with the t-rex up at the side of the vehicle. Vex?
Laura: I back up a little bit. Yeah, like that. And I'm gonna cast Hail of Thorns on him.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Sounds nasty.
Laura: Right? I'm gonna shoot like a regular attack.
Matt: So your bonus action to cast Hail of Thorns, and then you attack with the arrow, go for it.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: You're adding 11 to it.
Laura: Okay, good, then that'd be 18.
Matt: 18? 18 hits.
Laura: Yes, so I was casting that as a level three spell. I roll 3d-- that means I roll 3d10.
Matt: Against the creature?
Laura: Against 14 which is my spell level thingy.
Travis: 3d10.
Laura: Yeah, 1d10 for damage.
Matt: Yep, go for it.
Laura: That is an eight-sided dice, yay!
Matt: There yougo.
Laura: An eight.
Matt: That'd be 25.
Laura: I get another attack, so I'm gonna do that. Natural 20! (all cheer)
Matt: Nice, all right, go ahead and roll damage, double the dice and add your modifier of seven.
Liam: That arrow just went slow mo.
Laura: Double the dice. 15.
Matt: 15, all right. So what happens here is you pull an arrow out, as you whisper a couple of words under your breath, you see all these thorny spikes being to shoot out the shaft of the arrow. You release it and as it strikes in the front of its face, the arrow actually splinters, sending a bunch of these thorns all over its torso, piercing an inch or two into its armor with each blast of these thorns. It kinda rears back and tries to shake itself off. As it does, you get a little bit of a look as Grog backs away from it, checking to see the wound he left. You take your secondary arrow, aim for the red soft spot, boom, slips right past the armor plating, doing the extra damage on the interior of its physical self. Awesome, that's your turn I believe.
Ashley: Good turn.
Matt: Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, is my hand still stuck in its mouth? (all laugh)
Taliesin: I would like it to be.
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah, you could've left it there.
Taliesin: Do I have an advantage to hit if my gun is in its mouth? (all laugh)
Matt: You are considered grappled if you leave your hand there. You can remain grappled for advantage on the attack roll.
Taliesin: Done. So I get to roll twice?
Matt: You do.
Marisha: This is a whole new meaning to point-blank.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19, that'll hit.
Taliesin: Okay, I spent some grit on this, and did some interesting modifiers.
Matt: How much grit did you spend?
Taliesin: Two points of grit.
Matt: Okay, this is the--
Taliesin: The Deadshot. And I also took a negative five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot, and I'm using my fire modifier. I'm just being an asshole. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That's... 16 and 20, 35 points of fire damage inside of its mouth.
Matt: So, your hand inside, you pull back and fire, knowing which barrel is next. You hear this dull(muffled explosion) sound, and its eyes kinda pulse for a second, in intense fury and pain, smoke just billows out the sides of its mouth, and its nostrils, and it begins to kind of shake its head, lifting you about a foot off the ground, painfully, but you think it's worth the deal. Well done.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Liam: Aw man.
Matt: I will say that ends your turn.
Liam: Thank you Gary Gygax, wherever you are. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. The duergar, currently seeing the situation, and the change of tone, go and grab their weapons.
Travis: Change of tone. (all laugh)
Travis: Shit got real.
Matt: This duergar is going to move up, back to you, Scanlan, as it sees that you were the one that took over the general.
Sam: Dicks, bring it.
Liam: Dicks.
Matt: This one comes rushing in.
Marisha: Aw, come on.
Liam: Freakin' tank in the room.
Marisha: There's a bigger problem, bro.
Matt: Opportunists, man. It rushes after you, actually.
Liam: ♫ Why can't we be friends
All: ♫ Why can't we be friends
Matt: All right, the attack against you, Scanlan. That is gonna be a 17 versus AC. All right, this one is actually also physically growing in size as it comes towards you.
Sam: It's getting hard. (all laugh)
Matt: You suffer 16 points of damage.
Orion: Such a bummer.
Matt: As the war pick comes slamming into your side. You see it's coming, but you're just not fast enough. It hits you, on impact, it may have cracked a rib, you're not sure. The one that's coming up against you, rolls, that's going to be a 17 versus armor class.
Liam: Fuck you.
Matt: You see it and just duck out of the way, its war pick slams into the stone wall next to you, with a horrible screeching stone sound. High-AC rogue, yo. All right that ends their turn, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: I'm looking in, I'm like, oh, that's no good. I look at where he made the crack in the armor, where is that, is that in the head?
Matt: It's in the head area, right over here.
Orion: Right, awesome. I'm going to kind of motion towards the mind flayer, and give a telepathic wink.
Matt: It is on the ground.
Orion: Yeah.
Sam: Are you flirting with it?
Matt: You make a telepathic wink.
Orion: And I'm going to cast Telekinesis, and I'm going to pry open the metal. I'm not going to target the creature, I'm going to target the armor.
Travis: Nice.
Matt: Interesting thought, okay. See if it-- the 17 is the DC?
Orion: Yes.
Travis: This could be cool.
Matt: All right, it fails. So here's what happens. For the effect of this. It suffers, I'm gonna say it suffers about 2d6 points of damage from the tearing. So go ahead and roll that.
Orion: Six damage.
Matt: So six damage, however, you have effectively reduced its armor class by five.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: In doing so.
Sam: Ooh!
Orion: And I'm going to spend two more sorcery points, and do the spell again. I'm going to do a-- I'm gonna do Firebolt, right in the hole. And I'm going to use my metamagic wand to fire the spell.
Marisha: Fire in the hole!
Matt: All right, go for it!
Sam: He has so many dice, it's crazy.
Orion: Oh, that hits.
Taliesin: Actually, does that crit? Does your 19 crit?
Matt: No. Usually, 20 is only crit, except for, I think he has a bonus ability.
Sam: Critical Role by the way, name of the show. (all laugh)
Matt: It's okay, you're good, and you're a fighter, which means eventually you'll end up with four attacks per round anyway, so you're fine.
Orion: Can't do that.
Taliesin: I'm looking forward to it.
Matt: Damage, what you got? Scanlan, you're on deck, by the way.
Sam: I'm ready.
Orion: I zap him, I zap him for one.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Orion: No, no no no, I empowered it. Full, it takes ten damage. 'Cause I empowered the spell.
Matt: That's correct, so. As you pull down with the ray, it streaks down across the ceiling portion of the building, right into the fleshy, exposed part of its armor, now it looks like it has this giant jagged scar in the side of its head, where you can see muscle and sinew pulsing with each of its movements. You blast into it, you can see this darkened black portion of its interior flesh, it's now charred, slight embers beginning to percolate and burn on the outskirts of the impact. Well done, you gonna stay where you are?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: Scanlan, what you got?
Sam: Okay, I'm going, I know he'll get a hit on me, but I'm gonna run away from the guy behind me, run straight at the general, and just open out my arms in an outstretched big hug, and I'm like, come here big guy, come here! And I give him a big hug, and upon touching him, I cast Banishment on him and send him to another dimension.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Matt: As you move away, the duergar is going to attempt to make, as a reaction, to make an attack on you.
Sam: It's okay, it's all cool for Pike.
Matt: That's going to be a 13 versus armor class.
Sam: Does not hit.
Matt: You hear it coming, as you're walking, "buddy!" (all laugh)
Matt: Duck under a war pick.
Matt: With advantage on its saving throw. What's the DC?
Sam: DC?
Matt: The DC on your spell?
Sam: Well, if I'm doing it through my cone, it's 19.
Matt: I will say for this, you do not have it through your cone, because you had your arms open, you didn't specify, however, it still fails it's saving throw. The general, as you reach up, he has his war pick ready. Pulls back its war pick as the flames burst in. (all laugh)
Matt: Then blinks out of existence. (all cheer)
Orion: Nice move.
Ashley: One down, one down.
Sam: Oh, he's gone, oh, where did he go? I don't know.
Matt: How long does it last, by the way?
Sam: It's concentration. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. All right.
Liam: Scanlan Shorthalt, playing Vegas, ladies and gentlemen.
Sam: Do I get a bonus?
Matt: You do get a bonus action.
Sam: Okay, I'm just going to sing a little ditty to Pike, just to give her a little inspiration. I'll just do some pelvic thrusting-- a little (guitar), that's a flute, by the way. (all laugh)
Orion: Super, play that thing.
Matt: His electric flute gives you a d8 inspiration dice, so you can add that to any attack rolls.
Liam: He can do anything with any instrument.
Ashley: Sweet licks on your flute. (all laugh)
Matt: All right, so, Keyleth.
Marisha: So, upon seeing this big thing crash in, and I'm like, oh. Now you're really angry. But I just kind of analyze him and I say okay, and then I go, (grunts), and I turn into a rhinoceros.
All: Ooh!
Matt: Okay, I don't have a rhinoceros mini on me, so we'll use a bear for the time being, but we'll know it's a rhinoceros.
Sam: Why don't you have a rhinoceros?
Matt: 'Cause I was not prepared for such things.
Liam: Way to slack off, Mercer.
Matt: Hey, I'm gonna order a rhinoceros now, you happy? I'm gonna go to Toys R Us.
Taliesin: Get the whole animal collection. Actually got them, the whole set.
Matt: So you transform into a rhinoceros, now basically facing an armored beast with an armored beast.
Marisha: Kaiju battle. (all laugh)
Matt: Whatcha got, whatcha doing?
Marisha: I'm charging him.
Travis: Activity in the Breach.
Matt: You leap down, go in for the attack, this duergar already used its reaction, so it can't attack you.
Marisha: So if he fails to save, I knock him over. That's plus seven, so 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Marisha: Awesome!
Matt: Does save though, is not knocked over.
Marisha: A strength save?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Aw, damn it.
Matt: This is a big creature.
Marisha: He does, I do 2d8 of bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Seven, nine, 14 damage.
Matt: 14 damage, all right. You have multi attack or did you get the one hit?
Marisha: Well, I charged, yeah.
Matt: Okay yeah, so the charge is the hit. But you slam into it, your horn gores, you can see actually, you slam it into the side of the armor wound that Grog left and then Tiberius pried open. Part of it gets pulled back, and you see a quick splatter of some sort of bloody splash as you're staring to actually pull apart its interior. The horn is jabbed in there, and it manages to shrug it off at the last point. You do significant gore to its side.
Liam: Good musical riff.
Marisha: Oh, wait. No no no, that's right, keep going. It's actually 15 damage. I always forget that I have a plus one to attack.
Matt: 15? Yeah, don't forget that. You need to remember that. After taking the arrow wound, and after everyone else attacking around it, it's going to try and get a different situation. It's going to jump. It rears back, and leaps into the air.
Sam: Oh jesus.
Matt: Landing right on top of Clarota and Scanlan.
Sam: Oh no!
Ashley: Wait, does he get, do we get--
Matt: You guys all get attacks on it as it jumps away.
Marisha: We all get attacks?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Do I?
Matt: No, you do not.
Marisha: We get advantage, right?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Did he take me, no he didn't take me.
Matt: No, actually, you are still in its hand. In its mouth, it carries you with it.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: Okay, so 19, you hit.
Liam: 24.
Matt: Hit.
Travis: 26.
Matt: Hit. No, it's the three of you, so that's it. So all of you guys just roll damage for a basic attack.
Sam: Come on, kill him before he gets to me.
Travis: 24.
Matt: 24 damage? 24 damage you said? Nice.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Was I close enough to him to get an attack?
Matt: No you weren't, unfortunately.
Liam: 11.
Matt: 11, all righty, and?
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: So, as it lands. All of you guys have to make a strength or dex saving throw, your choice. For Percy.
Taliesin: Dex.
Matt: And Scanlan, and I'm rolling for Clarota. Clarota fails.
Taliesin: 20.
Matt: It's okay, it's okay, Scanlan. It's okay, you can do this.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: He's coming back from the other dimension. I rolled a nine.
Orion: Did it hit the floor or did you go again?
Sam: No, I used the one that rolled on the floor.
Laura: Roll it on the table, that doesn't count.
Matt: So Clarota is not prone.
Sam: Dungeon Master, does a roll on the floor count? What happened?
Matt: I usually roll on the table. I usually prefer to roll on the table.
Sam: It's even worse. (all laugh)
Liam: That'll learn ya.
Matt: You guys are knocked prone on the ground, and you all take 14 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 14 points of slashing damage. As he just lands on top of you. Yeah, so 28 points of damage, as it crushes you, and its claws sink into you. Clarota takes the same.
Liam: Did it drag Percy through the air?
Taliesin: Yes it did.
Laura: It did?
Taliesin: My arms are still stuck in its mouth.
Matt: You're not knocked prone, but you do take 14 points of crushing damage, as its mouth bites down on your arm again, for free.
Taliesin: That's fine.
Matt: It's going to actually release you, Percy. So you're there.
Marisha: Think your arm might be a bit busted.
Matt: It turns, and makes a bite attack against Scanlan.
Sam: As he does I distract him. (air horn blowing) (all laugh)
Sam: Playing my shawm.
Matt: That's the sound a shawm makes?
Sam: Cutting Words reaction.
Matt: Okay, so as your reaction, go ahead and do that, so roll the d8.
Ashley: (imitates horn)
Travis: It's like the start of a Pitbull song.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay, he rolled a 27. Reduced it by seven to 19. So even with the reduction, it's not enough, you're on the ground. It sinks its teeth right into you. You take, let's see.
Liam: These games keep getting better.
Matt: You take 41 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Scanlan!
Sam: No worries, I'm just at negative 36 now. (all laugh)
Marisha: Really?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: Wait, how did that happen?
Taliesin: That happened fast.
Liam: He's unconscious, he's in bad shape, but we're gonna get him.
Matt: Scanlan's looking rough, Scanlan is now just being thrashed around in the mouth of the creature.
Travis: How many hit points do you have?
Matt: His limp arms and legs just (thumping) as it's kind of just running him around and across the air.
Liam: Hashtag save Scanlan. Strings of gnome blood are being flung across the room.
Liam: Oh, he's so little though, he's so little.
Matt: Pike, your turn.
Ashley: Okay, so time for a Cure Wounds. So I guess. Let's see.
Matt: You can't even see him right now. If you want to Cure Wounds, you have to touch him.
Ashley: I'll go, yeah, I'll go.
Sam: I'm being thrashed around.
Ashley: Can I just go, he's over there?
Laura: He's in the mouth of the thing.
Liam: She's 25 speed.
Matt: So you can move five squares.
Ashley: Okay.
Marisha: Didn't you get that speed boost?
Ashley: How close can I get to him? I can't see the lines in the squares.
Orion: Don't forget your boots, Pike.
Ashley: Oh, I have sprinter's boots! I have sprinter's boots. Okay, so I'm gonna use my sprinter's boots. I can-- While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action, and click the boots' heels together, if you do, the boots double your walking speed for one minute.
Matt: So you can move ten squares, takes your bonus action.
Ashley: So then, I'm so sorry, I can't see the squares. So if I can get ten to get over there.
Matt: So you go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, there is a ledge there, and he's blocking the way up, so nine, ten, make an acrobatics check to actually jump and climb up onto the--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: With disadvantage, 'cause you have plate armor.
Liam: But what about her--
Matt: Disadvantage, you roll twice and take a lower.
Ashley: Wait, wait, hold on. Can I cast Guided Strike? Which adds ten to--
Sam: I gave you a dice. I gave you a dice.
Liam: Which means you're-- Ten.
Matt: Total of ten?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That's exactly what you needed. (all cheer)
Matt: That was the baseline. You run up, it takes all the strength you can feel, you're gonna be sore in the morning. All your muscles tense as you pull yourself up, with all the inertia from the run, your parkour up to the top, land, Scanlan's there, currently being flung around, you manage to reach up and grab him, and get in a brief tug of war with the bulette creature.
Ashley: Hey, get away from him, man!
Matt: As you cast Cure Wounds. Go ahead and--
Ashley: So that's Mass Cure Wounds, so does that heal--
Matt: Is it Mass Cure Wounds, or just doing Cure Wounds?
Ashley: I'll just do Cure Wounds.
Matt: So at what level are you using?
Sam: Don't chintz out.
Ashley: I'm gonna use it at the highest-- I'll use it at fifth level.
Sam: Cast whatever you can cast.
Liam: It's one or multiple people.
Sam: Can you do it at a higher level?
Ashley: Yeah, I'll do it at my highest level that I can cast, which is--
Sam: Let's not cheap out on Scanlan here.
Ashley: Sorry guys, I'm just warming up again. (all laugh)
Travis: Let's not skimp on Scanlan.
Liam: Remember when I brought you back from the dead? Remember that? Remember that?
Sam: Remember when my kiss healed you from death? Just throwing that out there.
Ashley: -- which I think is eight.
Matt: So it's 5d8 + 5. 5d8 + 5 is how much you're healing him.
Liam: You're gonna be all right.
Ashley: My spell attack bonus, plus eight?
Matt: You don't have to worry about the bonus, you're just touching him.
Ashley: So 5d8 + 5.
Matt: Is what you're healing him, yes. All right.
Sam: That's three.
Liam: I think you did it four times, yeah.
Ashley: 18, plus five.
Sam: I thought that was three, no?
Ashley: Yeah, 23, 23.
Sam: Plus five.
Liam: That was plus five.
Laura: Are you still unconscious?
Sam: But now I'm only negative 11.
Ashley: Wait, what?
Sam: I've taken almost 100 points of damage in this.
Matt: You're unconscious, how it works in this, and this is different from Pathfinder-- Yeah, you go to zero and you stay there. You are now up to 23.
Liam: You don't go below zero, you hit zero, and you're there, making rolls to see if you die.
Laura: You only have three chances if you roll, fail, three times, you die.
Matt: And if something hits you while you're unconscious, it's an automatic fail. Now you're 23 hit points.
Sam: Hey, I feel great, guys! (all laugh)
Matt: You're still in its mouth being shook around.
Sam: Oh shit! (all laugh)
Sam: What is this ride? This is crazy!
Matt: Pike, that's your turn.
Ashley: I can't do anything else, right?
Matt: Clarota's going to get up.
Liam: Come on Clarota, show us what you got.
Matt: Clarota looks pretty rough. Rears back.
Liam: Got to bring that mental power and that arcane magic, let's do it.
Matt: Taking a cue from the opening you left, Clarota pulls back its hand, you see a familiar spark of bluish electrical energy as Clarota reaches for unleashing a torrent of electrical arcane energy forward, into the form of a Lightning Bolt. Blasting across the bow of this giant creature. Let's see. Does not make its saving throw, so it's 32 points of lightning damage.
Laura: Clarota!
Matt: As the back of its armor is now seared, and you can see parts of its armored flesh are kind of blackened and charred and slightly crimping. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, so I've got enough room to run up to its anus, which I'll do.
Travis: As you always do.
Liam: It's got plenty of people around, so that means I can Sneak Attack him.
Matt: As you rush past, before you attack? This duergar that was right by you, that has currently grown to a larger size gets a free swing at you.
Liam: Ain't no thing.
Matt: That's going to be a 21 to hit.
Liam: Okay, that hits.
Matt: All right, with its war pike it takes-- deals 14 points of damage to you.
Liam: Who cares, I'm saving my gnome friend, okay. Here I go. 14, it's a 25 to hit his butt.
Matt: 25 hits.
Liam: This is my keen dagger, with vorpal blade, two plus seven is nine, that's just nine. Where's a pencil, that's a pencil. And then we add my Sneak Attack damage, which is six, seven, ten. 15. 21, plus nine, is 30.
Matt: All right, nice.
Liam: To the butt. Specifically to the butt.
Matt: As you rush up, you take a moment as it's thrashing about, and you can see what looks, anatomy-wise, to be probably where it expels whatever it eats.
Liam: The hole? Right in there.
Matt: You go ahead and just slash and eviscerate there.
Liam: How do you like me now?
Matt: Even back there it's heavily armored, it takes, you carve through, and it-- You've definitely left a lasting impression on this bulette.
Liam: Pucker up, baby, pucker up.
Sam: Hashtag, armored anus. (all laugh)
Travis: What, what, in the butt.
Liam: This is D&D in 2015, people, 2015. So that's the first attack, right? Now I get a second attack?
Matt: The general also, by the way, appears as the concentration spell was lost as you were unconscious.
Sam: I must have stopped concentrating for some reason.
Matt: However, it is right in front of, it's like. It's now in his face.
Liam: Second attack. 22.
Matt: That hits. Okay, and that's a four plus ten, ten points of fire-based damage to the butt.
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Travis: Preparation H? Fire damage to the anus.
Matt: That brings us to his turn.
Laura: The general's?
Matt: The general's turn, who now is there from the bulette, sees it, looks over and sees you.
Travis: It's right in front of him!
Matt: Kind of sitting there with your bloody hand. It's still flaming, swings back, and goes for your head.
Taliesin: God.
Matt: That is a 23 versus armor class.
Taliesin: Ah, yeah, that's gonna hit. Armor class sucks.
Matt: Plus the fire damage.
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 39 I wanna say?
Matt: Well, you take 31 points of damage. Including the fire damage from the pike, it goes for its second attack against you.
Travis: This thing sucks.
Matt: That's gonna be a 22 versus armor class.
Taliesin: That's gonna hit.
Liam: It's a tank.
Travis: One.
Matt: You take... That's gonna be 21 points of damage.
Taliesin: I'm out. Okay, Percy being pummeled and pummeled again. Loses, your gun falls from your hand, as you slump to the ground, your eyes roll back, unconsciousness and darkness.
Sam: We're droppin' like flies!
Matt: Taking you. That brings us to--
Ashley: Everybody knows shit's fucked.
Matt: Grog.
Travis: What, me? Bah! How tall is the thing?
Matt: Tall? I'd say it's probably about... 20 feet tall? 15, 20 feet tall?
Travis: Can I climb up on its back?
Matt: It's not your size, it'd be really, really tight, pinning in there.
Travis: I would like to run up to its right side and flank it.
Matt: Over here?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: So you run around. Which you can do, 'cause you're a freaking barbarian.
Travis: (snarls)
Matt: All right, go ahead, you're making your attacks. Go for it, three strikes against it.
Travis: 21. Hits, right?
Matt: 21 definitely hits.
Travis: 16 plus eight, hits.
Matt: Definitely hits.
Travis: Natural 20! (all cheer)
Travis: Does that mean I get extra?
Liam: Double damage, it means double damage.
Travis: Oh, double damage, okay.
Matt: So first strike.
Ashley: Kill him, kill him, kill him!
Travis: 16?
Matt: 16 damage?
Travis: Yes.
Laura: 21.
Travis: 21, thank you.
Liam: Stay in school, kids.
Travis: Stay on the table.
Matt: It's the critical now, so double the dice roll.
Travis: 20, thank you, and. 15, plus that, 20.
Matt: You double the dice, then add the modifier.
Travis: Oh, double the second one.
Laura: So that's 40 on the last one.
Sam: Jesus.
Laura: So 61, 76.
Matt: How do you want to do this, Grog? (all cheer)
Ashley: Oh, you killed him?
Liam: Yes!
Matt: How you wanna do this, Grog?
Travis: I would like to chop down into the fleshy bit, and after I've sliced--
Matt: The fleshy bit is on the opposite side, by the way. So you're now at an unarmored side. However, it's still holding Scanlan in its mouth, shaking him around, so, how do you wanna finish it?
Travis: Can I get to its mouth at all?
Matt: I could say for the flavor of this, yeah, you manage to just barely make it over here.
Travis: I would like to swing through and catch the corner of its mouth, open its mouth wide, and then I'd like to reach in, and with my teeth, pull its fucking tongue out of its head, and start thrashing it side to side. (all laugh)
Matt: First you rush up with your ax, using all of the aggression, you take it and swing it, barely leaving you with a shave. You gash the side of its mouth, and draw this giant wound open. As it does, you actually snap, and cut through the tendons that clench the jaw, causing it to fall open and slack. Scanlan spills out of its mouth, hitting the ground with a dull thud. As its mouth is now open, it kind of rears back. You shake your head angrily, as the froth is gathering at the corners of your mouth. You drop your ax from one hand, grab the jaw, reach in, bite down on its giant meaty tongue. Using your hand at the back of it, you pull and yank and you feel the muscle tearing and tensing before, eventually it comes free, and is now dangling about 25, 30 pounds, of very very wet, tongue meat. With your third attack, how do you finish it? (all laugh)
Travis: What do you after you're biting its tongue in your mouth?
Matt: That's what I'm asking.
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: It's looking really rough, but you still need to get that final death blow. What are you doing with this, Grog?
Ashley: Rip him apart.
Travis: Yeah, I'm gonna King Kong his jaw. I'm gonna take the broken part, the top of his head, and just pull apart.
Matt: Okay, so you drop your ax entirely, the tongue still dangling from your mouth. You reach and put one foot up into the bottom of the jaw, using your other hands you push and push, you hear it crack, and pull, as it tenses and is trying to push down. It has no tension because the jaw was destroyed. You pull back and hear a sickening snap, as the armor plate buckles underneath where the neck joint would be on such a creature. Its eyes kinda roll back for a second, and it begins to slacken. As it does, you reach up with your fist, and penetrate the bottom of where its brain would be. With a sickening (suction) sound, it goes entirely limp and collapses on the ground.
Liam: And that's why you're on the team. (all cheer)
Travis: And as it falls, the tongue that's hanging in my mouth, I look to one of the dwarves that's left, I go, who's next? (all laugh)
Matt: We're gonna end it there for the night. (all groan)
Matt: Damn guys, well done.
Taliesin: I'm sleeping.
Sam: Oh, Percy's dead, hashtag save Percy.
Laura: I want more chicken.
Matt: Before we finish, I'd say go ahead and throw a heal up on him.
Marisha: Oh yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Ashley: Good plan.
Matt: It's nasty, man. You guys picked that, by the way.
Laura: Oh seriously?
Travis: They did? You dicks!
Taliesin: You suck.
Zac: That was the chat room.
Orion: Try harder next time.
Matt: We'll be doing more of those as time goes on. Not all the time, but whenever I have the opportunity to put it in there, I'm gonna start asking for you guys to help me figure out what to throw at these adventurers.
Liam: You sadists. (all laugh)
Zac: We shouldn't tell them the other options, should we, just in case we wanna save them.
Matt: Oh no, they'll come back in, don't worry.
Ashley: 25.
Taliesin: Oh wow, I feel much better.
Zac: So you guys, we're gonna be doing a Q and A.
Matt: Yeah, for anyone who wants to stay over.
Zac: Anyone who wants to stick around, the audience has a ton of questions for you guys. For the audience, it's a sub-only Q and A, so if you're been wondering whether or not you should sub, let me give you some reasons why. Number one, you can ask these guys questions in a little bit. Number two, every 50 subs, we're giving away tabletop promo kits that are like $250 worth of special stuff, and we will ship that internationally, doesn't matter. Even in Antarctica. We want someone in Antarctica to do tabletop day, do you know anyone?
Matt: I don't.
Zac: We had someone last year.
Matt: Well shit, we gotta reach out then.
Zac: They're gone, they were like the only people there, and they're gone.
Matt: There's nobody there left, they were the last bastion. Well, somebody needs to move to Antarctica in the next few days and let us know, so then we can totally use that.
Zac: We also do a Minecraft server, for subs only, but if you want in on that, there's no automated message for that server info, so just make sure and message the Geek & Sundry account, and we'll get you that sub IP address for the Minecraft server. I know we have more, there's lots more stuff. We do some other sub-only chats throughout the week. lots of emotes, other fun stuff. But we're gonna go ahead and roll some videos while we get set up for the Q and A. This was a lot of fun, oh! I would like to challenge you guys to do a quick little donation drive for the charity that you guys support.
Matt: Yeah, for 826LA. Had it going up in the chat room, if you have the opportunity, you wanna help support these children getting side educations and tutoring.
Zac: You guys wanna tell them about, just to get them psyched up for it? 'Cause we can get that command going.
Marisha: Yeah, 826LA, they're a non-profit organization that helps primarily with literacy and creative story children for children between the ages of like five and 18. They have a really great young authors book that you can buy that's a collection of all of the kids' book, and you can also go and check out the time travel mart, there's one in Echo Park and then there's also one in Marina Del Rey. But you should just google 826, 'cause I know there's one in Seattle, I know there's one in like Atlanta. New York, San Francisco. There might be an 826 in your city.
Liam: 826LA probably, right?
Marisha: 826LA is who we're raising money for. But yeah all of the 826 store fronts are a little bit different, depending on where you go. They're super cool.
Matt: Guys, please, check it out, it's awesome. It's a good group of people, what they do is fantastic. If you have the opportunity please do, go ahead and donate to the charity.
Matt: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning in for the fourth episode of Critical Role, with the grand return of Pike, our cleric. (all laugh)
Matt: Necessary. Glad to have you back, I'm sure everyone here is glad to have the healer back.
Laura: Especially today.
Taliesin: Very happy today.
Matt: And a surprise return of Laura, so.
Laura: What a time to join the game.
Matt: Heck yeah. All right guys, well, we're gonna take a little bit to set up for the Q and A. Those who can stay, feel free to, those who can't, totally understand. We have kids and families to get to. Those who can will be here for the Q and A for the next hour or so.
Zac: One more thing, just so they know we're following through. We have the picture for you guys to sign. So Niareth won this, when we reached 1,000 subs, so I think Pike is all that's left for that.
Matt: Pike is left to sign this Player's Handbook.
Sam: I haven't signed it.
Zac: And then we've got the picture. So we'll pass that around while we're doing the set up.
Matt: Do any of you have the gold marker?
Zac: I'll find it.
Matt: All right, cool. Yeah guys we're gonna go ahead and set up for this, we'll see you in a little bit for the Q and A, thank you everyone for watching. Thanks guys. Awesome day at Critical Role, thanks.
Ashley: Bye!
Wil: Hey nerds, I'm Wil Wheaton, I know right? And guess what? It is back. International Tabletop Day has returned, this year on April 11th. What is that, you say? What is Tabletop Day? Well, if you don't know, then shame on you. International Tabletop Day is a worldwide celebration dedicated to the tabletop games we love to play with the people we love. People we like, people we've never even met before, it doesn't matter, last year we had over 3,000 registered events across seven continents and over 80 countries, that is amazing! But this year we're going to make it even bigger. "Will Wheaton, how can we make it even bigger than last year?" That's what she said. Start now. Trend #TabletopDay on Twitter, because that was awesome. Broadcast your plans on the internet, make a video, share pictures, start a blog, create a dating profile for other sexy gamers in your area, whatever you want. Celebrate it in your own way, but we wanna hear from you. Be sure to use #TabletopDay, or @TabletopDay to let us know. It is up to you, world. Visit TabletopDay.com to register your event, or find one near you. You can also download exclusive content and check out some of our favorite games. We will be streaming our own live event, here in Los Angeles for you to watch. And there will be more on that soon. You love tabletop games, and we love you, so join us in the global celebration, on April 11th. Play more games. Hey everybody, I'm Wil Wheaton, and I am coming to you semi-live from the Twitch TV set here at the Geek & Sundry stages in beautiful downtown Burbank, California. I am here to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Tabletop's RPG show, coming this June, but were afraid to ask. Or have been asking for close to a year and I've been saying, "We'll tell you at some point in the future." You can consider this the big announcement. It was incredibly difficult to cast this show. We needed people who were very comfortable improvising, who had experience playing role playing games, and who were available when we planned to shoot the show. It was surprisingly difficult to get a pool of people who fit all of those criteria, and choose the most awesome among them. So your cast playing in this wonderful show are: Yuri Lowenthal, Laura Bailey, Hank Green, and Alison Haislip. I'm really excited to have these people all together. They're all my friends, they are all wonderful storytellers, and they are going to be a tremendous party of adventurers. I'm only gonna try to kill them a little bit. The most frequently asked question since I announced that there was going to be a Tabletop RPG show is, hey Wil Wheaton! Why are you so awesome? The second most frequently asked question is, what system are you using to power this game? First and foremost, I needed a system that was going to support the way I play roleplaying games, and that is telling a story collaboratively with a group of players with me as the GM. I looked at some very well known systems like Dungeons & Dragons, and Savage Worlds, I looked at systems that I love, like Fate Core, and I even looked at the True 20, a d20 modern system. And I really wanted to use something that was released by an independent publisher. I wanted to bring something to the forefront of the roleplaying world that maybe not as many people are familiar with as I want them to be. But I wanna play the way that I played when I was falling in love with roleplaying games when I was a kid. I wanna be able to sit around on a couch and some chairs with my friends, not have to worry about a map on a table in front of us, and just work together to use our imaginations to tell a story. But there's a system that I really love that's elegant, it's easy to learn, it's easy to teach, it's very easy to understand, and it really just gets out of the way when you want to tell a story together. And that is the Adventure Game Engine that Green Ronin Publishing used to drive the Dragon Age tabletop roleplaying game. I asked the developer three years ago to please make generic, so that we can build a setting and put on top of it. They said actually this is something we really wanna do. And it's come together. We have been able to work together with Green Ronin to develop the fantasy Adventure Game Engine. This is gonna take a lot of the things you know from the Dragon Age RPG, and put it all together to support our world, which I have had the best time creating. I sat down three months ago with some amazing writers, and just started brainstorming about what kind of world we wanted to explore. But what I kept coming back to is, I love science fiction, and I love fantasy. Why not put them together? Why not build a world that is inspired by the 1978 Heavy Metal movie, and 1980's amazing Saturday morning cartoon show, Thundarr the Barbarian. I thought it would be great for characters to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures, and instead of them using crossbows, they're using laser rifles. I've got it all worked out, we have a huge team of writers that put all this together that built an amazing codex that gave terrific logic to all of these decisions that we made. We're not gonna tell you what they are. You may discover some of them during the course of the season. So what is the name of this incredible world? The title of our show is Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana. You can sort of come up with your own ideas about what those words mean. I know, but I'm not telling. 'Cause that's not how the Wheaton talks. Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here at Geekandsundry.com on June 2nd. For those of you not in America, Titansgrave: The Ashes of Valkana will premiere right here on Geek & Sundry on two June. So I hope that you're as excited about this as I am, and I hope that you will tune in, and then watch us for ten straight weeks of incredible high adventure story telling, and until then, play more games.
Ivan: Hey guys, Ivan here, the host of Game the Game, on Geek & Sundry's new Twitch channel. I'm here with Becca, Ify, and Hector, to get you excited about International Tabletop Day. So International Tabletop Day is going to be on April 11th, and all of our friends at AEG have brought us an amazing edition of Love Letter in order to play with you today. That's right nerds. It's Batman Love Letter. Now Batman Love Letter is a game of logic, deduction, and risk, in which you try to capture or hold the highest value card in your hand by the end of the rounds. In the meantime we'll all be playing cards in order to eliminate each other. But whoever has the highest-value card at the end of the round will win a token. So who will be the greatest detective in all of Gotham? It's gonna be Batman.
Becca: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it'll be Poison Ivy.
Ify: You guys both are wrong, it's going to be Bane.
Hector: It's probably not gonna be Robin. (all laugh)
Ivan: Now, normally we will play until seven tokens, but for the purposes of this video, we'll play until three. Whoever gets three is gonna win. Let's play. Pass out your cards Becca, one to each.
Becca: Burn the first?
Ivan: Burn the first. You have to burn a card before you even begin, because there is a mystery card that isn't in play normally. So keep that in mind when you're playing.
Hector: Burning a card, who are we playing with? The Batman villain Firefly? (all laugh)
Ify: Leave the jokes to me, Robin.
Hector: All right, fine.
Ify: Just so you know, I'm doing a set at the comedy store, and I need three friends to show up.
Hector: What night is it? I'm busy that night.
Ify: I didn't even give you the time yet.
Ivan: Hector, why don't you go first?
Hector: Robin.
Ivan: Robin, the man wonder.
Hector: Okay, here we go. I'm gonna play Robin. I've got protection for my entire next round.
Ivan: Right. So every single time you play a card, normally it has an action that is attached to it. So I'm playing Catwoman, who allows me to look at another player's hand. Poison Ivy? Noted. Now it's your turn.
Becca: It's my turn, so I draw a card. I'm gonna hang on to that one, maybe. And I also play Catwoman. And I'm going to look at Bane's hand. That's terrible.
Ify: You make fun of me but you lack the understanding of my strategy. I will play the Batman. I can't guess Robin's because he has immunity, but I can guess Poison Ivy's.
Ivan: If he can guess correctly, not only does he get a token, but she's eliminated from the round, and now there's only three of us available. So it's one step closer to victory. What's your guess?
Ify: My guess is Two-Face.
Becca: Incorrect.
Ivan: Robin?
Hector: Thanks, Batman. All right, here we go. I'm also gonna play Batman. I'm gonna guess that Poison Ivy has the Joker card.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Darn it. Jiminey Jillickers.
Becca: Now you have to do something terribly embarrassing, right? Or is that just Half Scrolls?
Hector: Like maybe wear a Robin costume, cool, sounds good. Oh, already doing it, great. So great.
Ivan: I have two cards and I'm going to also play the Batman. You've been picked on a lot, Poison Ivy.
Becca: I've been picked on so much.
Ivan: You played a Batman.
Hector: Get him Batman.
Ivan: I'm gonna guess you've got a Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Ivan: (groans)
Ify: No survivors!
Ivan: (laughs) All right, I'm done, go ahead, Poison Ivy.
Becca: If anyone's wondering why so many Batman cards are being drawn, it's because there are five in the deck. There's either one or two of all the other characters. So I draw, and I will play, myself, Poison Ivy. This card says, choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand, and draw a new card. Ivan, you look pretty confident. Discard.
Ivan: Discard, all right.
Becca: And draw a new hand.
Ivan: Had a Two-Face.
Ify: It's time for me to draw.
Ivan: I have a hard time thinking that we're gonna get anything out of you in that mask.
Ify: Oh, you'll see.
Becca: I'm sorry, what?
Ify: You'll see.
Becca: What did he say?
Ivan: I think it's something about seals?
Becca: Did you need help opening a seal?
Ify: I'll play the Batman, and I will guess Becca again, she has the Harley Quinn.
Becca: Incorrect.
Hector: Geez, we're terrible at this game.
Ivan: We're really, really bad.
Becca: I'm great at it.
Ify: Sooner or later.
Ivan: He's in there, or he's there. Not there, there. Not there, there.
Becca: There?
Ivan: There.
Becca: Where?
Hector: I'm going to play my own version of Bane. That was terrible.
Becca: You don't have the mask.
Hector: Myself and another player can secretly compare hands, and whichever hand is lowest is out. So I'm gunning for you, Poison Ivy. Because you kissed me that one time, and then you didn't wanna hang out with me afterwards, like that was really mean, so.
Becca: I had ulterior motives.
Ivan: I'm not looking, Batman's not looking.
Becca: I'm out of the game.
Hector: You're out, yes!
Becca: I had myself again.
Ivan: Which means you have a higher numbered card.
Hector: Yes, that is correct.
Ivan: Higher than five.
Hector: Good detective work, Batman. Real genius, this one.
Ivan: All right. This is the last card of the deck, which means after this, whoever has the highest card, wins.
Hector: Duh, Batman, we know, God.
Ivan: I'm playing Robin, Robin. All right?
Becca: That makes me think he has the Joker.
Ivan: Well, we'll find out won't we? What do you got?
Ify: I had myself.
Hector: Boom, Harley Quinn beats Bane.
Ivan: And the Joker beats Harley Quinn.
Hector: Darn it.
Ivan: I got you, Joker.
Becca: Take your token.
Ivan: I will take my narcissistic token that has my symbol on it.
Hector: This is just what Batman needed, an ego boost. Batman needed an ego boost, great.
Ify: Robin.
Becca: The deb chef, the deb chef.
Hector: You seem to live with a multi billionaire, yet can't afford contacts. What's the deal with that?
Becca: No burn card, no burn card.
Ivan: Oh, great. So since I won the last round, I get to play first, because I am the greatest detective. And I got a Catwoman, which means I think I'm interested in Bane's hand. Whatcha got, Bane? You got crap, is what he's got.
Becca: Choose any player including yourself to discard his or her hand and draw a new card. Hector, burn your card.
Hector: You got it, but it's Robin, and I'm not gonna tell you again. All right, I had Batman, which is cool, because he's the least value card in the game, so that's just gonna help me out, so I'm just gonna grab a new card.
Ify: All right, I'm going to draw. Draw a card. Oof, oof, oof, such a good card.
Ivan: Who are you gonna use it on, Bane?
Becca: It's probably Batman.
Ify: I'm gonna do a Batman card. Robin, do you have Poison Ivy?
Hector: (laughs) No.
Ify: My turn is over.
Hector: All right, it's my turn. Dick Grayson and Jason Todd, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, Carrie Kelley, John Blake, help me. Okay, here we go. My girl Selina Kyle, Catwoman, bam. And I wanna look at Bane's hand. Show me back here buddy, show me back here, whatcha got?
Ify: Got this.
Hector: Okay, good to know.
Ivan: All right. I'm going to just play my ward Robin.
Hector: You're welcome.
Ivan: Grant me immunity.
Becca: Batman. I'm gonna guess that Bane has Poison Ivy.
Ify: You're wrong!
Becca: You'll never have Poison Ivy.
Ify: I'll use Catwoman.
Becca: To look at another player's hands.
Hector: Pause for error.
Ify: I will look at Poison Ivy's hand.
Hector: Don't do it Bane, don't fall into that venus fly trap. Get it, 'cause it's a trap, 'cause it's. It's a plant based pun.
Ivan: Good job.
Ify: Ah.
Ivan: There it is.
Ify: Ah. Ah!
Ivan: Robin, Robin go ahead.
Hector: Okay, here we go.
Ivan: What's it gonna be?
Hector: I'm gonna play Batman. And I'm gonna guess that Bane Has a Batman card.
Ify: You are wrong.
Ivan: For once he doesn't have a Batman card.
Ify: I want to point out to the watchers. Hector looked at my hand.
Hector: Oh I did, that's true.
Ify: And saw me play the card. He knew exactly which card was in my hand. And chose the wrong card.
Ivan: This is why you're the boy wonder, and not Batman.
Hector: I'd like to point out, that my chest has made me very uncomfortable, and I'm clearly out of my element, and dressing me up as Robin was a good call everybody, good call everyone. Good call guys. Wow.
Ify: I really thought that was game over for me. I was wrong.
Hector: Oh my God. Your annoying voice has really gotten into my head.
Becca: That's his greatest power.
Ivan: I also have the Batman. So we know he doesn't have a Batman, you know what it is. Thanks Robin. Useless. So I'm gonna guess that Bane has Harley Quinn.
Ify: You are wrong!
Ivan: Damn. I tried. All the clues are there, just one missing element.
Becca: I played Batman, I'm going to guess that Bane has Two-Face.
Ify: You are wrong as well.
Ivan: He has the Joker then, or something. How can you throw that many Batmans at a single man, and not get what he's got in his hand.
Hector: He really did break you, he really did. And now I'm Nightwing, great, that's how long that took.
Ify: I'm going to say. Two-Face can trade hands with Becca.
Becca: (sighs)
Ivan: That's where it was. Robin?
Hector: It's my turn.
Ivan: Diddly fingers.
Hector: You guys think you're gonna win this? You don't know Dick. Greyson, because that's my real name. I'm gonna play Bane.
Becca: Bane-in it up.
Ivan: What's up, who's gonna compare?
Hector: It's gonna be you, Batman. Let's see what you got, old chum. Oh hoh, bye, you're out. (laughs)
Ivan: Batman card, so. Batman's out.
Becca: Batman's the worst.
Hector: Oh my gosh.
Ivan: How's it feel to knock a man down from his tower?
Hector: It feels great.
Ivan: Right, okay.
Hector: How's it feel for not giving me--
Marisha: Great for my back.
Zac: We're live.
Matt: What's up everyone, we got this camera right here in the middle, right?
Ashley: Hello.
Liam: Oh, hi.
Matt: Thank you guys for watching. Hope you enjoyed yourselves. These guys all being crazy players, and kicking ass, and occasionally getting knocked unconscious, and nearly eaten.
Zac: Any mods want to put this in sub mode for us? Let's do sub mode.
Marisha: So you have to sub. Bye everybody who's not a sub.
Ashley: Bye!
Zac: They can still watch, they just can't ask questions.
Orion: Oh. Okay.
Marisha: Well, your word is not important.
Liam: Laura had to bugger out.
Ashley: Wait, is that a little icon of you?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: What?
Orion: Yeah, he's an emoji now.
Ashley: You're an emoji?
Matt: It's weird.
Taliesin: He's made it.
Ashley: You've made it.
Matt: All right, so how are we doing the questions? Are we just picking as we go?
Zac: You can moderate yourselves.
Ashley: Laura and Sam did leave.
Matt: Unfortunately.
Ashley: Laura had to go to a thing, and Sam had to go to a thing.
Matt: Sam's thing is kids. Sam has two kids. Liam has two kids, but he--
Ashley: Hey look at-- (all laugh)
Matt: I am so sorry, everyone.
Liam: I mean he's pretty good at Dungeon Mastering, right?
Ashley: Yeah, he's pretty good.
Orion: Someone asked what alignment we are. First question, what alignment are our characters?
Marisha: We're all good.
Liam: Chaotic good.
Ashley: Chaotic good.
Orion: Tiberius is chaotic good.
Travis: Chaotic neutral, bitches.
Liam: What was your first roleplaying experience? I saw that go through.
Taliesin: GURPS in high school.
All: GURPS.
Matt: The second edition of Dungeons & Dragons in high school.
Travis: This.
Ashley: Was my first, yeah.
Liam: This guy just started. I did AD&D in high school, and I DM'ed while playing, which is totally cheating. This is the first pure experience I've had.
Orion: This is my first campaign also. I was a Magic the Gathering fan.
Marisha: I actually had Matt as my first DM, way before All this started. So I played a few other games, and then, now I'm back to the OG master.
Liam: I saw, when and how did you all start playing together? The reason this started is because, I directed Matt as Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 6, and every time he came in he would say, "hey, you know, I'm running a game, you can come in and just do a one off." And I was like, "oh, I got babies, I can't do that, I can't do that, I can't do that." And then finally once for my birthday I thought, I can do a one off, it'll be the only time we'll do it, just see how it goes. Scanlan and I did a podcast together, and every week we would do some new thing, and we're like fuck it, let's play D&D. We all did it and everybody got snake bit, and it's been the best thing that ever happened. To me at least.
Ashley: Yup.
Orion: Our character alignments do matter on how we play the characters, an earlier question.
Matt: Yeah, they do definitely matter. A couple quick answers here. The conversion from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition was decided because, as we're going on to this show, and we had so many players, combat tends to get bogged down, and a lot of floating modifiers in Pathfinder. For large groups like this it's difficult to keep it flowing and moving. I felt once I had taken a look at Fifth Edition, that the combat system was a little more simplified, and a little easier to make freeform and just roll with it. So that was a much better decision. Plus Dungeons & Dragons generally has a better name recognition than Pathfinder, so when you're putting a show out there, it's probably easier to do with very minimal transition, it took a little bit of customizing, like for Percy's gunslinger. We just had to customize it, we made it ourselves. We sat down.
Taliesin: Took a day.
Matt: Took a day, and we worked out, some of the stuff we wanted to keep, some of the things that didn't break it, we wanted to make it interesting. It is a martial archetype for the fighter class. So it does give the bonus a fighter class does. Nothing is too overpowered about it, other than just having custom weapons, and some cool grit-based abilities that we kinda transferred over from Pathfinder. It's interesting. It's a good challenge to see how it works out.
Taliesin: It is, it's working out. I'm digging it. I keep reading and finding things I'm not doing that could be more interesting, so.
Matt: Keeping your hand and firing into the mouth of a bulette is fun.
Taliesin: That felt great.
Liam: Travis, everybody's asking about your shirt.
Travis: Oh. I think it's a website called redbubble.com? I just googled Grog, and there was that.
Taliesin: Just google Grog.
Travis: I needed it right away. Right, right.
Liam: I'm also seeing, why did we switch from Pathfinder to Fifth Edition?
Matt: I answered that a second ago.
Liam: Oh, you did?
Matt: Yeah, the idea being that the reason we switched was it was easier for large-scale combat, and the system was a little more simplified, and I felt for such a large party it'd be easier to do. Plus character creation for any guests we have in the future, so that was the main reason. I love Pathfinder, but at this size, it's good. Answering your earlier question too, I saw someone ask, a good party size. Legitimately, my preference is between four and six players. This works because they're amazing players, and because we keep it very freeform, and not getting bogged down in minutia too often. The four to six players I think is a good sweet spot.
Marisha: I see, does Keyleth have limitations on what animals she can transform into? Yeah, for the most part I can only transform into beasts and I have to be under a certain challenge rating. So right now, at my level, I can only turn into beasts that are a challenge reading of three or lower.
Matt: A third of your druid level, right?
Marisha: Yeah, a third of my druid level which is nine right now. But for the most part I can change into almost anything as long as it's under a challenge rating of three.
Matt: Pike, how do you feel about Scanlan? Do you return his affections?
Ashley: Oh, well. I'm on the fence about him. He's really pretty great, but I don't know. I'm not really sold yet.
Marisha: You know Pike, I feel like we haven't actually girl talked about this.
Ashley: I know, we never girl talked about it.
Marisha: We should.
Ashley: I know, we should talk. I just, I really like him, I think he's really funny. I really the fact that he's a musician, but.
Marisha: That's hot.
Ashley: I don't know, I'm not really sold on him yet.
Marisha: I'm just concerned if he could treat you well.
Ashley: Oh no, you know what?
Marisha: He's got bad habits.
Ashley: He likes to frequent brothels and things like that, which, you know. I'd wanna give him his freedom and his space. I don't know if I'm into it.
Taliesin: If I say it so you can understand it, what's the point?
Liam: Someone's asking if we like presents. I think we'd all like fan art.
Matt: Fan art's awesome, we love it.
Liam: Immortalize our shitheadedness, that'd be good.
Marisha: Oh, it's true.
Ashley: Another couple people on there were asking about my ears. And I really like supporting small businesses. And there's a store on Etsy called Tiny Tangerines, and she makes these by hand. And makes like deer, and bears, she makes a ton of stuff.
Matt: That's really cute.
Ashley: Check her out.
Liam: We still got that little one. Socrates asked what was a favorite moment before we started streaming the show? Our first game was pretty amazing.
Marisha: Our first game was great, I've got some good memories from that one.
Liam: Most of us, I was giggling uncontrollably, I couldn't believe we were doing it. And just watching my friends, who I work with all the time, just dropping into character, there was no like, oh, let's see, what will I do, what am I doing? I will move, I will roll. Like Bailey, Bailey dropped into character from the get-go, and was a ringer. But the moment I was thinking of was when Pike died. Pike died.
Matt: Like died died.
Liam: Shortly before we switched from private to public. It was emotional. A couple people started crying, I teared up. We put two and a half years into this, and we're all very connected to it. I'm not gonna get into it, but I've had a hard couple of years personally, everything's fine, but this was like therapy for me. And to see one of my friends go down?
Ashley: It was sad.
Liam: It was fucking emotional.
Marisha: I don't think a few people were crying, I think everyone was crying.
Orion: I was crying.
Ashley: I was definitely crying. I was like, "no, I love doing this so much!" I don't wanna, I mean, when you spend that much time with people, over two and a half years, you get so attached, and attached to characters.
Marisha: We know these characters almost as well as we know each other now.
Matt: Factoids, the tower you made for us in Minecraft is awesome. Seriously, well done, look at the pictures, it's great, we're gonna have to actually go through it.
Marisha: Wait, we have a tower?
Matt: A guy built an entire tower for the group.
Ashley: No way!
Marisha: They built a castle Greyskull?
Matt: Essentially, on the Geek & Sundry Minecraft server. No. Wait no I did see that! It was huge.
Zac: It towers over the entire --
Liam: Of what?
Matt: Of him! Someone made a sculpture of--. Did you make that or somebody else? You made that?
Zac: Oh no.
Matt: Okay, somebody else made it for you.
Liam: Do we have $50 in the budget to go on eBay and get a Castle of Greyskull set? Put it on the set somewhere? Let's do that.
Matt: There we go. I see a couple quick questions.
Orion: To answer your question, there is an origin of Tiberius, fully written. I won't say it all right now, but he comes from a political family, and there's a whole bunch of layers to him. He is a thought-out character. The buffoonery is half-planned.
Marisha: I mean, we're all really deep, thought out characters.
Orion: Well, they asked if I actually thought out a story for him. He does have a thing for this character named Allura.
Matt: Yeah, Arcanist Allura, the one that actually sent them on this mission, he has kind of a thing for.
Orion: She's super awesome. Hot, I think she's hot.
Matt: She's pretty hot.
Ashley: Super hot.
Matt: The gunslinger class info, I actually posted on Twitter a few days ago, it's in my dropbox if you look through my Twitter. It's on there, otherwise, we'll probably put it up on the website, when all the website stuff is up there. I'm happy to release it now. It's pretty balanced, it's fun. Might have some tweaks down the road, depending on how things play out. You should go to my Twitter, you'll find it there.
Travis: We're gonna have a website with all our characters.
Liam: Yeah, we're working towards that.
Matt: Working on it, yeah. Like a lot of things right now, it's a work in progress.
Liam: Someone asked what kind of food would everyone like?
Orion: Ooh, like Thai food.
Liam: I like Indian.
Matt: Ooh, Indian is good.
Ashley: I really noticed--
Zac: Let them know not to order food.
Liam: Don't, that's a terrible idea.
Orion: We just had a bunch of chicken.
Marisha: Oh you mean like right now? Yeah, don't do it right now.
Zac: If you tell them what you want, all of a sudden I'll get a call, like, "your food is on the way!"
Marisha: Yeah, no, not right now, maybe next week.
Travis: Matt, you're going to Wizard World in Philly. But we will not be joining because we don't own a private fucking plane.
Marisha: But I'll be there. Is anybody else gonna be there?
Travis: Oh really?
Marisha: We'll be there.
Liam: Somebody asked something, like, what do we hope is the result of this show? I can't remember the wording. Obviously we're doing this because we love each other and we're having fun together, but I also hope, D&D has been, its entire history has been like, "oh, it's this weird thing that guys do with dice in a room." Anyone can do this, I love video games, I work in video games, but D&D has changed my life. It is social, it is person to person, it is real, because it's people in a room doing shit together, and that's kind of lacking a little bit in our world, and I would say find some friends. I mean, I love that there are sort of online tools to play with people across the country, but if you can find three or four people in your town to do this, I'd say do it. Do it.
Travis: Yeah, do it.
Marisha: There's something really amazing about the fact that we're all essentially kind of building and communally developing a story together, and that's something that not a whole lot of things can grant you, and we don't really get in today's society much. We're all kinda creating this as a thing. And I think it's good that we're like, hey, this is socially acceptable. D&D's cool, everyone should play D&D.
Matt: Actually, the IT Crowd episode of D&D is one of the best on camera examples of a D&D game night thing.
Orion: That is an awesome episode.
Matt: Fucking hilarious, and a great, truncated version of this is kinda what the game is. So good on you.
Orion: Cut to them weeping.
Taliesin: So many questions going so quickly.
Matt: I know.
Ashley: I want a Grog shirt that says "do it."
Taliesin: And the kitty shirts were an accident. This was not planned.
Marisha: Oh yeah, our kitty shirts.
Liam: Someone's saying what edition to start with? I would start with the most recent, because you know they're gonna keep updating it over the years.
Matt: Fifth is great, Fifth is a great entry point.
Liam: It's really loose. I feel like all of us felt like, we were doing Pathfinder, and... Fucking loved it, otherwise we wouldn't be doing it, but it was really intricate, and we were doing it every six or seven weeks, when we were off-air, so. We felt like the rules were really complicated and we'd lose track of it. We loved doing it, obviously, but Fifth Edition is really fast and loose. I recommend that. And Travis just stuck his finger in my ear, he kinda does that. He hits me in the nads a lot.
Matt: This is a homebrew campaign. I wrote it all just kind of for the hell of it. Custom, don't really base it on anything existing. I feel like I'm playing more in that world, and I always hate the idea of, in the middle of DMing, having to go to a module, or having to look for a rule that wasn't my own. It feels more detached. There are modules that are great, and I've run great modules, but for me personally, with the pacing, and the flow of the game, I prefer to do homebrew.
Liam: Connected to that, someone asked, if you had any tips, and I'd like to know the answer to this too, because I'm running a game for my eight-year-old son and his friends who are about to start, do you have any tips for new DM's?
Matt: Yes. Let's see. I could do a whole panel on that. Tips for new DMs. Preparation is important. You wanna outline cities, come up with ideas for NPCs, that you think would be essential to a story, or like people that really run elements of the town. Simple notes can be like, they're this race, this is their disposition, if you have a particular voice you wanna try for, make a note of this kind of voice. So whenever you come back to them you have a reminder. And spend a lot of time building that structure, you don't have to be too detailed. Always leave room to play in the world, because you never know what your players are gonna do. Be prepared to improv. I prefer loose preparation, and then just kinda rolling where the players take you.
Liam: Although you wrote a monologue for Clarence, right? Because that was very intricate. We were all just ready--
Ashley: Yeah, there's no way you just thought that up.
Matt: There are certain elements, part of the notes I take is for certain NPCs I'll write down key information that they know, and depending on how you ask them, what you say to them, and what you try and extract from them, they might give you some of the information, they might not, if you coerce them, or intimidate them. Or if they're willing to give up the information, I have all that written down. So for that information today, you guys were asking him, and since you allied with Clarence, he was willing to discuss with you. So I had all that prewritten, but depending on how much you said, it was what you guys asked.
Liam: Do you have random encounters ready, in case we're like, "ah, fuck it, I don't wanna go down to the dungeon, I wanna go back up and beat up some dwarves." Do you have shit kind of ready?
Matt: Yep. I have a stack of different creature and encounters already prebuilt, based on what you guys may encounter. Tonight was an example of players being able to pick what happened. But also it's one of those things where it depended, I don't know where you guys are gonna go. I present a story, I present an idea of a general throughline, but how you guys go from point A to point B, that's entirely up to you. Sometimes that can be a very long, meandering line, sometimes it could be a direct ray, so.
Travis: There was a question, how much do you improvise, and when is it appropriate to improvise?
Matt: A lot, and always.
Marisha: Always, yeah.
Travis: The answer is yes.
Matt: I've had whole games where I've prepared a session, and none of it happened, because people just put an entirely wrong direction. Not wrong, but a different direction. So the whole game was just me pulling everything out of my ass.
Marisha: Like that time we walked through the back door of the Thieves' Guild, that was fun.
Matt: Yeah, there was that.
Marisha: What's up, Thieves' Guild. 'Sup.
Orion: Donkey Kong, Pikachu.
Travis: What?
Orion: Somebody asked me what my favorite Smash Brothers character is.
Travis: Oh.
Liam: Somebody asked how we pick the character class that we picked. When we first started this game, and I said, "hey, it's my birthday, I wanna play a game." Laura really likes rogues as well, but I made sure that as fast as I fucking could.
Travis: She was pissed.
Liam: So she, yeah. She plays rogue, in like Dragon Age and everything. That shit's a favorite class of hers, so I know I got it out there. Also, the reason that we're twins is because Laura and I have the exact same birthday, May 28th.
Ashley: I didn't know that.
Marisha: I didn't know that either.
Liam: That's why we're twins.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: I knew-- I came in late to the game, and there were only a couple options left. And I had never played, so. I picked gnome because I was like, oh, that's funny. And then cleric, I didn't really realize what a cleric was. And how detailed it can be if you've never played. And important to the game. So when I started I was like, well shit, this is a little tougher than I thought it would be. But it's been awesome, I love being a cleric.
Liam: I'm so glad we pulled you in.
Ashley: Me too, man, me too. Oh, also, someone asked, who is Pike's deity. And it's Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, among other things.
Matt: Which is carried over actually from Pathfinder. Fifth Edition has its own suggested, there's never a definitive pantheon. But they have the deity pantheon. But we're carrying over Pathfinder deities that were prominently in the campaign up to this certain point, because why the hell not? We're not gonna make her change her deity, that would be weird.
Marisha: Travis, how did you pick your character?
Travis: What? Oh. I asked what the biggest playable character was, I think. One that liked to fight, drink, and fight.
Liam: One of the greatest pleasures for me, and I'm obviously a huge nerdlinger, and this is just me reliving high school. When I was talking to Sam about starting all this, and saying hey, let's get together, it's what I wanna do for my birthday, we pulled Travis in, Travis is fucking tight, look at him. He's not the stereotypical D&D player, and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us. Play Dungeons & Dragons, please play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: It was so good.
Ashley: It's the best.
Liam: It'll make you so happy.
Orion: What about you? Keyleth?
Marisha: I remember at the time I had a, we were playing another campaign, and I had like a rogue assassin, that you were in with me. And I had a kind of assassin character who was super seductress, and really high charisma. And I remember when I joined this game, I didn't really know any of you guys really all that well, and I was kind of new to this world, so I ended up going with a kind of druid, and I kind of deliberately made her introvert, in a weird way to kind of reflect my newcoming to the group, but I was like, "whoa, it'll be like I can be quiet." so Keyleth has a really low charisma, but I kind of spin it in that she's naive, and doesn't really know. And that's why she says things like, "but Clarence." (all laugh)
Marisha: "You're just special." Because she's naive, and kind of quiet. So she was just different than anything I've played before. But I really love being a druid. Druids are great.
Taliesin: I played a lot in school. Other than Matt, I probably had the most experience playing D&D, and playing roleplaying games.
Travis: Yeah you did. Genius.
Taliesin: So I was really excited by the gunslinger in Pathfinder just 'cause it was something I hadn't done before. So I found it the most interesting and unusual, but I was not, and I also felt it was a hole within the group that could be filled very well.
Liam: Thedouginator keeps asking you, Matt, how you brought the party together the first day of play.
Marisha: Wait, we haven't heard Tiberius' story as sorcerer. Then we can answer that question.
Orion: When this was going on, I asked Matt if there was a caster yet, like any glass cannons, and he said no. So I debated between a wizard and sorcerer. When we went over the different mechanics, how a wizard and a sorcerer works, I was more drawn to that. And I'm a huge RPG guy.
Liam: You're so entertaining.
Orion: To piggyback a quick question, to seal off the Tiberius thing, somebody asked if any of our voice acting influences our characters. Tiberius, absolutely. I played Elminster Aumar in the Neverwinter MMO. Which is a D&D MMO. And when we started this I'm essentially doing Elminster, but I made him super bubbly.
Taliesin: No, someone asked how the group, yeah.
Matt: We got together, first session, essentially, was in a swamp town named Stillben, and the group at the time had, for their own separate reasons, been in this town, needing money, and had kind of come together as a mercenary group out of necessity. So the first session was them having known each other from a circumstance where they all ended up helping out an individual in the city, long story short, they had a small rapport, and knew at least each other were useful, and needed cash. And there was a job board in the town. So the first session was them being hired to look into a conspiracy within this swamp port town, Stillben. That was their first real adventure together. And when that finished, they kept going from there.
Orion: Uh, troll penis story.
Ashley: Troll penis. (all laugh)
Marisha: That's fair.
Orion: I know you guys keep asking.
Liam: Take it away, Mercer.
Matt: There was a battle. Subterranean battle that involved the party sneaking upon a group of two trolls that were around a fire. The idea to work past this came to Tiberius to transform himself visually into a female troll so he could Bugs Bunny them. Hey boys, you know, that thing. Not knowing the temperament of trolls, especially ones that are deep underground, and don't get to see female trolls very often, they immediately just got extremely aggressive, and he found himself almost between a rock and a hard place.
Orion: I was getting raped by trolls.
Matt: The party then descended upon these trolls, and in the middle of battle, at numerous times, I believe Percy once and Laura the other, both took specific shots at each troll's dick. Rolled a good shot with enough damage to blow them off. Now being a troll, they regenerate. But it was still a good effect, and when the battle was over, it was decided by the party to at least take one as a trophy and place it in the bag of holding.
Travis: That was decided by me, thank you.
Matt: By Grog, and as such, it stayed for a while, until it was used as an implement of distraction in another encounter I believe.
Travis: It worked.
Matt: Yeah, it worked. That was where troll dick came from.
Orion: It was spitroasting.
Liam: Jake Bodro asked what's it like playing for three hours in front of 2,500 people? I think our games have gotten a little bit better, only because when we play privately, there were sometimes lulls, where we weren't sure what to do, we would go off to bathroom, we would take a break. But now there's a little bit of the element of theater to it. Just a sprinkle of it. And it kinda of gooses the energy up.
Orion: I'm doing the same thing for the record.
Travis: I keep seeing this one. For the 11 year old Sadie, the son of Odin shall have that cookie!
Matt: Aw, that's sweet.
Ashley: There you go.
Matt: There is one bag of holding in the group, and Grog always has it.
Travis: A troll dick and a bulette tongue.
Matt: There are many things that go into the bag.
Travis: It hasn't gone in that bag.
Taliesin: Is there still a cow in the bag?
Travis: No, Dork the ox.
Matt: Dork the ox is probably not.
Travis: That's when we first learned its limitations.
Matt: Why does Scanlan have so many awesome spells? Bards in Fifth Edition have one of the options they can choose. As they level up, can choose a couple of spells from any spellcasting class, which is great, and the boon that bards kinda needed to be more combat-effective. And you can choose the School of Lore or the School of Combat, I think, for the bard. He chose the School of Lore which allows you even more spells from other classes to boost your repertoire, so he became a fucking amazing bard.
Liam: Also, Sam Riegel did a lot of a capella in college.
Travis: He did, he really did.
Liam: He helped write several seasons of The Voice, which was all about a capella, so Samis sort of a ringer for the bard class.
Matt: Yeah, kinda had to happen that way.
Travis: Can Marisha do her dwarf impersonation?
Marisha: Nope.
Liam: Yordee yorda--
Marisha: Yorda youree yourdee yourd.
Ashley: Someone asked if Grog could keep one of his women in the bag of holding. You can't put living things in the bag of holding.
Taliesin: As we've learned.
Matt: You can.
Marisha: With Dork.
Matt: They just die.
Travis: There's no air, it's like a vacuum. A magical vacuum.
Matt: Dork the ox did not survive.
Travis: One giant dead ox came out of the bag.
Liam: Someone keeps asking if any of us have hirelings, or henchmen, and the simple answer to that is no.
Matt: That's not true.
Liam: Just Trinket.
Orion: At our Keep.
Taliesin: We do.
Liam: Oh, that's right!
Travis: Yeah, we battle-tested them.
Orion: We have a Keep back in--
Liam: Right before we started.
Travis: The game before we came here. After they saved the kingdom of Eman, the sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, as part of his gift to the group for essentially saving his family and the city itself, had a Keep constructed for them, and took about six months or so, and the Keep was finished, and then the party's first session was them finding who they're going to hire to take care of the Keep for them.
Liam: It was like one episode of the Sims.
Matt: Kind of. It was great too, 'cause Grog's whole idea of making them to see who would be the better hire was to break the pool cue and be like, "who survives?" Make them fight, it was pretty great.
Taliesin: For Tone17, I played a modified Malkavian, and a Smetty if you can believe such a thing, which was badass.
Matt: There you go.
Liam: We've been playing for two and a half years. Someone wanted to know how long.
Taliesin: Oh my God, really?
Travis: Did we tell them about your podcast with the recording of the very first one?
Liam: If you want, Sam and I, it's kind of languishing, but we have a podcast together called AllWorkNoPlay.
Travis: It's amazing.
Liam: We're both parents, we have kids, so we have no time to do anything. Enough time to take a shit. The first or second episode, the first episode is about us playing the first game, and there's audio from the first game. Again, go to iTunes, or to AllWorkNoPlay on Pod Bean, and you'll hear about two minutes of us dealing with a puzzle that Matt threw at us.
Marisha: It was timed.
Liam: Yeah, it was timed, there was an hourglass going off. It was us discovering D&D really for the first time. AllWorkNoPlay, all one word.
Marisha: Actually one of my favorite stories that I tell all the time is about you, from our first game, 'cause if you remember, I didn't play. I just kinda helped Matt help you guys. I was like a D&D minion. And I remember I was helping you, and I remember you were like, "So, if I just wanted to go up and punch those guards, I could do that?" And I was like, yeah, well you would go up, and you would punch them, and then Matt would tell you how you'd do that. And then you went like this, you were like.
Travis: Computing.
Marisha: Yeah, you were like, "so, we can do anything?" (all laugh)
Marisha: And I was like, yeah.
Liam: Taliesin on game one was actually not Percy, he was a dragonborn paladin?
Taliesin: I was a dragonborn paladin.
Liam: You fucking blew our minds, we were like, "what do I do? Can I do damage points to stop this puzzle." There was this tunnel with all these moving parts, we thought we were gonna be crushed, and he was a dragonborn for the first episode. It's in the recording on the the AllWorkNoPlay podcast. And he just breathed ice on this water-based--
Taliesin: Contraption.
Liam: And froze it, and everyone was like, "you can do that? You can't just roll dice and hit it?" And that's when we kind of understood oh, it's whatever the fuck you want.
Taliesin: That was such a good game for learning the basic mechanics. Such a well put together game.
Orion: Matt does control the music while we play.
Matt: Yes, I have playlists. They were much more broad playlists before, unfortunately on the stream, we have to use only approved royalty-free music, so it took me a while to figure it out previous to this.
Travis: I do miss those Madonna songs.
Matt: I know. I used to play a lot of Bush.
Marisha: Hey, would that count as fan art? If fans made us music?
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Could we then use that? Yeah? He's nodding.
Zac: They can send us whatever they want.
Marisha: Some consent forms? Yeah.
Travis: If one of your characters died, would you roll a new character?
Orion: Music people out there.
Marisha: Any music people. Anything atmospheric.
Liam: No, no, that's an important question.
Travis: Ignore it.
Liam: No, it's important. Someone's asking, if we die, would we roll in a new character? And plus, we just started this show, so part of us were wondering like, what if we die the second episode? What happens? We recorded this opening to the show that's coming.
Matt: So here's how I run the world. I feel that one of the problems in some RPGs is that death becomes flippant when magic allows you to completely undo it. In my campaigns certain powerful spells like Greater Restoration, Resurrection, things like that are a challenge, meaning you can definitely undo death, but a lot of it is based on your capabilities as a spellcaster, your attachment to the people you've been traveling with. So if ever a character does die, a resurrection can be attempted, but it is a challenge. Which means there's a possibility of it failing. In which case, if the resurrection fails, the soul is lost, the character is permanently dead. The player then can leave and never come back if they want to, but they have the option to create a new character, and be reintroduced to the campaign like half a level lower than the rest.
Ashley: That would suck so much.
Liam: When Pike died we had, all of us, many series of dice rolls to do, and it was very story-based.
Marisha: Yeah people are asking how she came back.
Liam: Yeah, I mean, luckily we were in a big city, there was a huge temple. There were very wise clerics who were good at bringing people back. But still, we all had to roll. There was three rounds we had to roll, he might have fudged numbers, I don't know. But we were all still scared. We had to all, the majority of us, had to have good rolls three times in a row. Scanlan had to put--
Travis: The tears of three women in the room.
Liam: The tears, Scanlan had to kiss her on the head, he put a figure that he carved of her, it was very elaborate. This one was majorly in tears. Laura was in tears.
Ashley: I was in tears.
Taliesin: Laura was hyperventilating.
Orion: And when that was going on, I remember, when that went off, being still Tiberius, I was like in half character but half not, and I was not crying, I was like, (grumbles) the whole time, and as soon as she sprung back to life, because the cleric--
Matt: Breathed in her first breath after that.
Orion: We luckily, because I know it was a tight roll.
Matt: It was a very tight roll. It was a DC of 14 in the final roll, and because Scanlan brought out this figure of her that he had carved for her like two months beforehand as a gift, sets it down and kisses her on the forehead, and it was kinda the final connection point. He needed 14, he rolled a 12, but, because he-- There's a plus two modifier to the skill check, being a bard, and that was what he needed, he just made it. Basic, basic--
Liam: Someone's asking if we drink while playing, and the answer is no. (all laugh)
Travis: It's just water in those tankards.
Taliesin: Coffee.
Marisha: I almost did, yeah.
Orion: When she came back to life is when Tiberius, I was like, "oh my God, she's okay!"
Ashley: I think also having-- Because with magic and everything like that, just bringing somebody back to life so easily, since we don't have that as much as maybe other games-- It's heightened, so every time someone gets hurt, we're all, I think now, after having that death, all of us are like, "where are you at? Where are you at?"
Orion: Where are you going? I wish I could turn to Sam, but he's not here.
Ashley: We're all so stressed out now, which is, it's kinda cool.
Matt: Mortality's a real thing you have to deal with, and up until Pike's death it was kind of a thing people weren't considering. It just happened so suddenly.
Liam: One I see keep coming up since we started is how would we react to life if we were our characters? I don't know, or differently from our characters? 'Cause I wouldn't stab my children when they frustrate me.
Matt: I'd be in a padded room. (all laugh)
Marisha: I feel like everyone tries to make decisions in a game that their character would make in real life, 'cause that's kind of the point. I take into consideration that I have shitty charisma, whenever I open my mouth. I feel like we all try and take into consideration our background and our alignment, because that's, you know.
Taliesin: I feel significantly more badass than my character.
Orion: I feel... Tiberius is just me with magic. So that's how I feel.
Travis: Grog was easy, he makes bad decisions, which is just all that I do.
Matt: Pike died when they were fighting what was called a treachery demon, or a glabrezu, which had basically infiltrated the Sovereign Uriel, and the city of Emon. And when it revealed its final form, it got one lucky critical hit on Pike when she was too close, and just instantly took her out. That's how she died. Someone's asking if they can (laughs) send us equipment we need for the show. Zac.
Zac: Yeah, they can.
Matt: What do you need?
Zac: We'll put it on the wishlist.
Matt: There you go, it's on the wishlist.
Orion: There's a wishlist?
Matt: I didn't know there was one, but now there is.
Zac: Castle Greyskull on there.
Liam: How do we feel about Team Demihooman, and inspiring them to play D&D for the first time? I think the number one reason we all wanna do this is because we love each other, and we love this game. The second thing is we all knew, we kind of felt like-- We're gonna make Dungeons & Dragons cool again.
Matt: Try at least.
Liam: And make it open for anyone to do, there's no reason not to do this. If there's someone you know who doesn't understand it, don't worry about it. Just find some friends and connect with them.
Matt: I find one of the difficult things is explaining to somebody who has never played an RPG, or a game of D&D at all, they're like, "how does it work, what is it?" And it's hard to explain, so if anything, now we have an example with this show. Other than the IT Crowd episode, or the Community episode, which are both great examples for quick little succinct things.
Taliesin: If we had the power to bring one guest player for one session.
Orion: Oh, that's easy. Tom Hanks, for sure. (all laugh)
Marisha: Mazes and Madness.
Zac: Everyone is asking for you guys to somehow get Vin Diesel.
Marisha: I was gonna say, Vin Diesel.
Orion: He lives for this shit!
Matt: Vin Diesel's good. Top of my list is Stephen Colbert, because I know he also plays.
Ashley: That would be amazing.
Taliesin: I would love to see Joss Whedon do this. I admit I would like to see Joss Whedon play D&D. That'd be interesting.
Zac: That might be possible.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm throwing that one out there.
Orion: What, Tom Hanks isn't?
Marisha: Felicia's got some.
Matt: But he's also a super fuckin' busy man.
Orion: Guys, tweet at Tom Hanks to come play with us.
Travis: I'm Morgan Freeman, and I rolled a one.
Matt: Right now, Critical Role Hanks. See if we can make it trend. Patton Oswalt would be great.
Orion: That'd be hilarious.
Zac: What about Dan Harmon, just so I can get fired, can we do that? (all laugh)
Matt: Yeah. Hardwick used to play D&D with Patton Oswalt in the mid-2000s. I can't even imagine what those games were like.
Orion: I'd like to like-- Amy Poehler, I'd like to have one of those.
Zac: She might be open to that. She's a partner with Legendary.
Orion: I'd love her, Tina, Tina Fey.
Liam: Someone keeps asking about Troy, I don't know if Troy Baker is ready.
Orion: I don't think he's ready for this jelly. You guys think he's ready for this jelly? I don't think so.
Matt: Whenever it comes up in conversation, Troy always gives me that look of like... "All right."
Travis: You can see him swimming in the infinity of--
Marisha: "That's not cool."
Liam: He has some preconceived notions.
Marisha: "My scarves are cooler than you."
Matt: Once we get him like a proper plus two enchanted scarf.
Ashley: Can we ship Grog and Vex?
Travis: Grog and Vex. No, I'm here to annoy Vex by smacking her bear around, and she's here to tell me not to kill myself. "Don't jump into the crevasse, it's 1000 feet deep."
Ashley: Troy Baker is Pike's distanced dad. (all laugh)
Matt: That's pretty funny.
Liam: Answer this question I like, I saw it a couple times, how did you guys get involved in streaming for Geek & Sundry?
Travis: Virgin sacrifice.
Matt: The best way I know that happened was, we had been playing for a while, and we all work in the industry. People began to hear about our voiceover D&D game, weirdly. Like I'd come into sessions with directors I've never worked with before, they'd be like, "Oh yeah, you're the guy that runs that D&D game." How did that happen? How is that my thing? I'm cool with it, like heck yeah, my little high school self is like, I'm okay with being known about that. But then over time eventually Geek & Sundry contacted us. Felicia had heard about it. They called me in for a meeting, and we spent a number of months trying to figure out what format we were gonna try, if we wanna do it like multi camera, filmed canned episodes, then eventually the Twitch possibility came up, and we were like no, this is a much better format for us. And that's kind of how it happened.
Liam: Are you kosher with me, you took this film, there's a video of you breaking the news to us that Geek & Sundry came to you about it. Are you kosher with me sharing that video?
Matt: Yeah, I don't see why not.
Liam: All right, I'll find a way to put it through my Twitter. So just keep your eye on my Twitter.
Ashley: Wait, what are you sharing?
Liam: There was a video that Orion took when Matt told us about Geek & Sundry coming to him. And us all sort of toasting and laughing.
Orion: Reacting.
Liam: Giggling like idiots.
Matt: Why is D&D Pathfinder making you so much more attached to the characters than a regular RPG? If you mean like a video game RPG? I mean you get attached either way, but with this, because you are so much more fluid, with how you can influence the world, and the character, and the way the character reacts to the world and how it can influence it is so much more--
Marisha: Personal.
Matt: Personal, a good way of putting it. It's just that much more involving, and you invest so much into that atmosphere. And it depends on the group, some people just like to do dungeon crawls, and kill and get loot and experience, and that's totally cool too. For me at least. I like 'em both for different reasons. I still play the crap out of video game RPGs.
Liam: Someone asked if given the chance, would we like to do a live game at a convention like Acquisition Inc.? I'd like to do, although there's nine of us, so that'd be kind of--
Ashley: That'd be a long game.
Zac: We may be asking you guys to do that soon.
Liam: Oh good, then yes.
Matt: As long as you're handling the tech, I think we'd be fine with that.
Liam: I'd like to do it.
Zac: We may be streaming from Comic Con, I don't know. We may be asking if you guys are gonna go through that hell hole.
Liam: The answer is yes.
Orion: Can we get a jib? I like crane shots.
Marisha: Ooh.
Ashley: A helicopter? A helicopter shot.
Orion: Put it on the wishlist.
Zac: Put it on the wishlist, a jib.
Liam: How many of you aside from Matt have run a game of D&D or another RPG? In high school I ran a D&D game, I ran a Rifts game for a little while.
Matt: Rifts, yes.
Liam: I ran a cyberpunk game for a little while.
Travis: Really?
Liam: Yes. The last two months I have been helping my eight-year-old son and two of his friends from school create characters. And I wouldn't have done this if Matt had not forced this shit into my life. I wouldn't have done this, but I'm about to start running a game for my son, the half-elf druid, and his two friends, the dragonborn fighter, and the dragonborn rogue.
Travis: What if they die?
Liam: That's just how the cookie crumbles, motherfucker.
Travis: Oh man, you are teaching life lessons.
Marisha: Gotta teach lessons.
Travis: Go Fish and then D&D.
Taliesin: I ran a Rifts game as well in high school. Then I ran a game of Vampire the Masquerade, and I was in a bunch of them.
Liam: Of course you did.
Taliesin: Couple rounds of Paranoia, and Hole, because that's funny. Hole was amazing.
Matt: Which you gave me books for. For my birthday, which was awesome.
Marisha: I was a part of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer tabletop RPG for a while. Yeah, it's actually quite fun. I was a pyromancer.
Orion: Somebody asked a fun one, they asked if we play, what's our favorite video game?
Marisha: What's our favorite video games? Oh that's a hard question.
Orion: Is it?
Marisha: There's so many!
Orion: Well we can skip it.
Liam: Metal Gear, Dragon Age.
Ashley: Probably Portal, Portal or Dragon Age.
Matt: Portal's great.
Liam: Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, I played 'til I had blisters on my thumbs.
Matt: Symphony of the Night, yeah, dude. What is a man?
Taliesin: Borderlands 2, and I'm happy--
Ashley: Borderlands 2.
Liam: Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64.
Orion: Oh shit.
Liam: Baldur's Gate, which I played again on my iPad a year or two ago. Somebody, oh go ahead.
Orion: I was just saying.
Liam: Somebody asked how we focus in the room with the sexual magnetism that is Scanlan Shorthalt.
Ashley: Ooh, it's tough man.
Liam: I don't know.
Taliesin: I wear a codpiece. I wear a codpiece that keeps everything in check.
Matt: I'm heavily sedated most of the game, just for that reason. Otherwise the clothes would just come right off.
Liam: I just let myself get a gigantic boner every week.
Matt: Does anyone play League? Generally.
Marisha: Sometimes. We're playing Heroes of the Storm more now.
Orion: I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. I like all kinds of games. I definitely would say if I had to pick one RPG, cause I'm an RPG guy, I love Chrono Cross, that'd be my favorite game. I've played that more than I have Chrono Trigger, which is way too many times.
Travis: Dragon Age race/class. Ash, anybody that plays?
Matt: Elf rogue.
Taliesin: Human fighter.
Travis: Always the mage.
Liam: Travis, stupid question, Thor, Odinson, or Hulk, in a knock down drag out?
Travis: Oh (scoffs).
Orion: Type-0 also, dammit.
Travis: Contractually, Thor, realistically, Hulk. I mean I am Thor, I can't say any other guy.
Taliesin: Hulk's on a scaling power level, 'cause he just gets too mad.
Travis: Yeah let's just be real about that. That's Hulk.
Matt: Tried new Final Fantasy yet?
Ashley: ChocolateSweets a bunch of times has asked would you guys consider cosplay for the games?
Taliesin: Well technically. We already did.
Marisha: You'll see, maybe next week?
Matt: He's trying the best he can. We have an intro coming up some point soon.
Zac: Halfway done.
Matt: Halfway done, we all shot loosely in character costumes inspired by everyone's characters, so you'll be able to see that soon.
Taliesin: If anyone would like to make us costumes.
Liam: One man doing it all.
Travis: A million arms.
Ashley: I think it would be kinda hard for me to play the game in cosplay, 'cause I have probably the most armor now.
Matt: You do. You wear the most armor.
Orion: That's a cool question. If you had to switch characters Matt, if you had to switch characters, which one would you be?
Marisha: If you had to trade places with one of us?
Orion: Yeah, if you would switch characters.
Zac: That question was Matt included, question was for everyone, if you guys could switch characters with anyone, who would you pick? Including Matt.
Ashley: I would probably switch with Liam or Travis.
Taliesin: Tiberius would be mine, I'd take Tiberius.
Liam: Scanlan, I would be Scanlan.
Matt: I would be Scanlan, bards man. Bards are my favorite class.
Marisha: I'd be probably either Scanlan or Pike.
Travis: I'd be Trinket.
Matt: Yeah you would.
Travis: Why are you peeing on everything?
Marisha: Bards and clerics are great.
Orion: I'd definitely be Grog. Just the complete opposite of what I can do.
Taliesin: I'm a WoW player on occasion, I haven't played in ages.
Orion: For the Horde.
Matt: Player wants to play a lizardfolk monk, what's my opinion about the idea? That's fine, I mean a player can play whatever they want to, as long as you as the DM want it in your campaign. Just make sure they have more to their character besides "I'm a lizard monk!" have a good reason why they trained as a monk. If they make a cool personality behind it, work it into the social structure of their lizardfolk people, and see whether the monks will be shunned or accepted, are they an outcast of the society? Think of those ideas, and make a cool character based on the story, from a fighting standpoint? That'd be cool. I used to play a lizard monk in Ruins of Kunark back in the old EQ days. Oh man. That was a while back.
Liam: Someone asked when Trinket came into the mix. Day one.
Travis: Day one. She had that shit like that. She knew she wanted a pet bear.
Marisha: He hasn't died yet.
Orion: He hasn't died, it's amazing, this thing has not died. He should have died so many times.
Matt: She spent all of her character focus in having a pet from combat, and then never puts it in combat, because she doesn't want it to get killed, and it's fucking hilarious.
Travis: We put it jeopardy situations before.
Matt: Yeah, you have. Every time she goes, "never again!" And I'm like, all right, well.
Taliesin: The day that bear dies, it's gonna get ugly.
Ashley: It's gonna be bad.
Orion: It's good to change her, as a character.
Travis: Alignment shift.
Taliesin: So much black to wear.
Marisha: Douginator asked me a super detailed question. So I don't wanna blow over it, 'cause it was awesome. He asked me how my path has gone, and my personal Aramente journey, and how working with the group has helped and slowed it down. For the Air Ashari and for Keyleth's journey, it's kind of expected to take her maybe ten, maybe 20 years? It takes her like, the Aramente is expected to take a long time, and part of it is her kind of proving herself a hero. So she kind of ended up tagging along with this motley crew in order to kind of help her so she's not doing it alone. So it's a good thing that she's tagging along. But she also has to deal with sometimes the moral dilemma of maybe choices that she might not normally make if she wasn't with the group that she has to go with.
Liam: I see two questions I wanna address. One is what is each of our favorite kill?
Orion: I was gonna say that was a good one.
Liam: And the second one is what's the story behind the Super High Intensity Team? (all laugh)
Liam: Let's start with the kills, and then we'll get to the SHITs. My favorite kill, I finished off a blue dragon we faced. We all chipped away at this dragon, someone who had disguised himself as human for a long time, then we came to their secret cubbyhole, and they revealed themselves. We chipped away and chipped away, then at the end I sort of parkour-ran up a wall and shoved the daggers into its neck, and just slid down its entire body and finished it.
Orion: My favorite kill is actually--
Liam: Until today.
Orion: When Pike kicked the bucket, and that moment all of us realized what happened, and there was an instant shift in real emotion, where whatever the hell, I don't even remember who we were fighting, because I went like, fucking cast this, and everyone's just, kill this thing, because we all cared so much in a real life situation, where we hated this thing, with real emotion, and we just slaughtered it.
Taliesin: The demon-possessed royal family was my favorite.
Liam: That was the same thing.
Taliesin: Yeah, that was my favorite fight. Just using the light, also we were shooting, I was getting to shoot holes in the glass.
Matt: The entire throne room had a glass dome overtop, but because the family had been possessed by the shades, these shadow entities, it was all covered. They were able to force these spirits out of the physical bodies without killing them by being able to tear off the cloth or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in and use that as part of the battle tactic, it worked out really cool.
Marisha: Yeah, that was fun.
Travis: My favorite kill wasn't even an enemy, it was when Scanlan summoned that pony, when we were facing those five wizards. (all laugh)
Travis: He summoned this pony, and then I turned and abruptly cut its fucking head off, and reached in and grabbed its organs, and smeared its gore all over myself, and started screaming. And Mercer was like, "okay."
Orion: The fight ended there.
Matt: Roll intimidation, with a bonus.
Travis: Butchered a pony for intimidation.
Matt: Yeah, it worked.
Marisha: I think one of my favorite Keyleth moments, it wasn't a kill, but when we were in the crazy, Michael Jackson, Neverland Ranch, sorcerer dude's plane of existence.
Matt: The Dread Emperor.
Marisha: Yeah, when we were in his plane of existence, and we encountered that big tree rock monster, and I just happened to take Command Plants, and he happened to be a plant monster, so it just worked out perfectly, and I was just like, "we don't wanna fight you! back down." and avoided an entire battle.
Taliesin: Getting the magic carpet was also pretty badass.
Marisha: Oh yeah, that was a good story.
Liam: Another fabulous moment that you guys have to know about is we wanted to get into a tower at one point, and there was a very intelligent sort of right-hand man to whoever owned the tower. Scanlan just started fast-talking, which is his defining characteristic. Took his finger and put it right here as a mustache, and said, "hi, I'm Burt Reynolds." (all laugh)
Liam: And he rolled, either Scanlan rolled a 20--
Travis: I think it was a natural.
Matt: He rolled a natural 20.
Liam: And you weren't expecting it to work, in any way, shape, or form, and you went, "okay."
Travis: Mr. Reynolds.
Marisha: Burt Reynolds just announced that he's gonna be at Philly Wizard World with us, so we could theoretically tell him that story.
Matt: I have to.
Ashley: Burt Reynolds would be a dream guest.
Orion: Him and Tom Hanks.
Travis: He'd have to play on a bearskin carpet.
Matt: The whole family history organized.
Ashley: I've only had one kill.
Travis: But, it was what?
Ashley: And it was a dragon.
Travis: Yeah, dragonslayer.
Ashley: But the thing that I, probably the whole battle with the family that was sort of possessed when I actually died, that was probably one of my favorite battles. Maybe not after I died, prior to. When I got to finish off the dragon--
Taliesin: Was that on Christmas?
Ashley: The dragon? Yes. That night was so amazing because we had, we made it a winter festival. So we all came in our pajamas. It was close to Christmas, that's why it was a winter festival. It was like our little Christmas party.
Marisha: Our holiday episode.
Liam: That was sad for me because it was my idea but I had health problems at the time and I had to bow out, and I was very, very, very sad.
Matt: But you made it to this year's. I made it the following year, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we had a whole little thing, it was really nice.
Matt: I would love to play D&D with Dame Judy Dench.
Marisha: Heck yeah.
Matt: You guys can tweet at her so you can get her to agree.
Liam: The SHITs. How did we become the SHITs?
Matt: Yes. So the party had run into a, debearded, actually, shaven dwarf named Grimthorn, who wanted to represent them for, what is occasionally, a roving brawling guild, essentially. Like underground fighting rings that happen around the world at different points throughout the year. It may come up again, we'll see. But they had to think of a team name. And Scanlan. Recommended the Super High Intensity Team. Which stuck for a while, so the group name, against the better judgement of, I think, a lot of the group, became The SHITs. So their name for a while was The SHITs, they were announced as The SHITs in the ring, when they won the tournament. That was when the pony was cut in half, to intimidate the opposing team.
Travis: Scanlan's idea also.
Orion: Tiberius and Keyleth were not happy.
Matt: SHITs stuck for a while until eventually they got rid of the SHITs, as all of a sudden they were about to go to the winter festival parade in their honor for saving the entire city of Eman, and the Sovereign Uriel said, "what should we announce you as?" and it was decided not to announce you guys in front of the city at your parade as The SHITs.
Ashley: I was super into it. Still love The SHITs.
Matt: Instead the name became Vox Machina. So if you've heard them say that, that's the official team name they've created for themselves as a group.
Orion: With credit to Sam as well, which was voted down was also the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. Which I was a huge fan of. I really wanted it to be the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood. But Vox Machina sounded cooler.
Ashley: The Brotherhood of the Sisterhood of the Order, or something like that?
Marisha: The Order of the Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Orion: So Tiberius recognizes as the Vox Machina/Brotherhood of the Sisterhood.
Liam: LargoSensei keeps asking, what are your most cathartic voice acting experiences? I'm gonna guess for Ashley that's The Last of Us, since that's your fucking heart ripped out of your chest.
Ashley: Probably, yeah.
Liam: Gollum was pretty sad for me, because he's a miserable bastard. Also Angel from Wolverine, the X-Men.
Orion: Wait, does cathartic mean sad?
Liam: Well it just means get your fucking demons out. Chew it up.
Taliesin: Mine's really old, it's probably either Monster or Paranoia Agent. I'm gonna go that far back. Yeah, all the way back.
Matt: Fate Zero for me had a moment that was pretty intense emotionally, that I really enjoyed.
Travis: Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic. (all laugh)
Matt: Sonic Boom, yo.
Marisha: Boom, Sonic Boom.
Travis: What's that?
Liam: Infamous, maybe?
Travis: Oh, yeah.
Liam: Pretty fucking sad.
Travis: Brothers. Brotherhood. Brotherly love.
Orion: I'd say for me it was doing Type-0. Not so much the actual lines, 'cause I had a lot of fun. I don't know if that's cathartic, but. Completing an actual real life dream goal. I've said this a couple times before, but the last day I was recording the last stuff, I was literally crying on the way home, because I finally got to level myself up. And this thing kept it up, and it was really cool.
Travis: Matt, who were you in Fate-0?
Matt: I'm Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu Emiya.
Travis: Bless you.
Matt: Thank you. That's the dark assassin character.
Taliesin: Saw a question about Percy's home, and his family. Percy has a really really big family, that I don't mention in the video, and he has not been home yet. He has no interest in going home yet, 'cause that's terrifying. So we have not dealt with that.
Matt: That's going to be interesting when that comes around.
Travis: What's under the freakin' lake?
Liam: What's under the freakin' lake, Matt?
Marisha: Yeah, what's under the lake?
Matt: You were told.
Orion: Yeah, it's one of those big--
Matt: Aboleth.
Marisha: Oh yeah that's right, I did write it down.
Matt: Which you encountered one underground.
Marisha: Yes, I was a shark.
Matt: Put the slime into the water. You could only breathe water and couldn't breathe air.
Marisha: Remember, 'cause I was like, "I'm gonna be crafty and turn into a shark," and then I started immediately drowning.
Orion: How do you keep players from getting OP, Matt?
Matt: Make the monsters more powerful.
Orion: Behind the scenes, I'm always constantly up his ass, trying to make Tiberius as OP as possible, and he's always stopping me a lot.
Matt: Balance is important. I mean, the characters, everyone here has really good characters that have a lot of cool abilities, but they also have a lot of challenges that come at them that make them, not only use those abilities, but also, monsters can have cool abilities too.
Liam: Bracheon89, you said Stephen King plays D&D?
Ashley: Yes, that's what I was trying to say. What?
Liam: Bracheon, we're going to wait for your answer. How do you know he plays D&D?
Ashley: Are you sure?
Liam: Let's get him in here.
Matt: I'd love that.
Taliesin: The group's worst decision in D&D was the dragon, I think.
Marisha: Oh yeah, Grog?
Taliesin: Grog.
Travis: Listen, there was a shitload of gold.
Ashley: I still don't think that was a bad idea.
Orion: Oh, when he started hoarding all the gold?
Marisha: We still don't know if that--
Liam: Takes a lot of stupid.
Marisha: He might have been an ally. We might have killed someone who was valuable.
Taliesin: You were still freaking out like a month later, you were feeling really bad.
Travis: Well, I did almost get us killed.
Ashley: I feel like it was a good decision.
Matt: To be fair, it's the only time I've ever had a player rage loot before. (all laugh)
Matt: You went into a rage, and used it to just loot more. And then the dragon revealed itself, and you looked at it, and you just kept looting. (all laugh)
Travis: You guys take care of this.
Ashley: That was hilarious.
Matt: That's Grog.
Liam: Somebody keeps asking, and we'll do a show of hands here, Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones?
Ashley: Oh, come on.
Marisha: Ooh, that's tough.
Liam: What do you prefer? 10 seconds to think about it, and then I'll--
Taliesin: That's like Star Trek or Star Wars.
Marisha: Yeah, hard.
Liam: They're asking the question.
Zac: Don't be afraid, come on.
Travis: That's tough.
Liam: Lord of the Rings, fuckin' Lord of the Rings. There you go, there's the answer.
Ashley: I don't know, man.
Taliesin: Lord of the Rings, but I see Game of Thrones on the side.
Liam: I love Game of Thrones.
Marisha: Of course we do.
Travis: Lord of the Rings.
Taliesin: We wouldn't have Game of Thrones without Lord of the Rings.
Marisha: That's the thing.
Liam: Maybe possibly not Dungeons & Dragons without Lord of the Rings.
Ashley: This is true, it's the OG. I don't know what that even--
Taliesin: You said that. That just came out of your mouth.
Ashley: Please let's leave it alone. Moving on.
Travis: That's the OG.
Ashley: What is this, what do we have over here? Well, who was the old gnome that Grog saved in his intro video?
Liam: Pike's daddy.
Ashley: No, that was my great great grandfather.
Travis: That's right.
Ashley: Yes, great great grandfather Wilhand.
Travis: Wilhelm, hand? Wilhand.
Ashley: That's right.
Liam: Wilhand the money.
Travis: Grog has an intelligence of six, he's gonna get names wrong from time to time.
Liam: Everybody, if you could choose whatever fantasy world to live in, what would it be?
Travis: Marvel.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Orion: I would live in the... Next Generation world, universe.
Taliesin: You had me at Marvel.
Travis: Yeah.
Zac: Here's the thing, you could live in Marvel what you live in, if you couldn't live in that world as a superhero, just as a normal person.
Travis: Right, not in New York. Anybody that lives in New York in the Marvel universe is just stupid. Like rent's gotta be $1.50.
Taliesin: Terrible idea.
Matt: I'd say Myst. So I can just write my own worlds to infinity from there.
Liam: Lord of the Rings.
Matt: Or Amber as well.
Ashley: I was gonna say Lord of the Rings. Maybe Rivendell.
Marisha: I'm gonna say Final Fantasy 10.
Matt: Grey Havens. If you're gonna do Lord of the Rings, do Grey Havens, 'cause you're far enough away from Mordor, where it's generally not gonna be a problem.
Liam: I wanna be one of the Fellowship. Ashley Johnson lived in a Marvel universe already, right?
Matt: That's true.
Orion: See, and it's a big hassle.
Marisha: It was a big hassle.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: Before the stream, our D&D session--
Marisha: High insurance rates.
Matt: Before the stream our D&D sessions would happen once every month to month and a half, more like month and a half.
Liam: Why is Matt Scarlet Witch?
Matt: I'm down with it. 'Cause I alter reality. Power makes sense. Our sessions used to be once every month, or month and a half, and they would be about six to eight hours. But the problem is we'd play so infrequently, every session I'd have to remind everyone what happened, and it was hard to schedule. Part of the reason we're even doing this show, is because it's technically work, which allows those of us who have families and children more of an excuse to come more often. So yeah.
Liam: Googoo17, Arkazey keeps asking, what's your favorite nerdy t-shirt you own? Mine is one that says Mordor World Tour, it looks like a rock 'n' roll t-shirt, but it says Mordor World Tour.
Marisha: That's cool. Favorite nerdy t-shirt.
Taliesin: I've got a Sons of Anarchy Doctor Who t-shirt, I'm a really big fan of. I'll wear it next week.
Marisha: I've got like an army, kind of soldiery, looking t-shirt that says Chimera, like Chimera Corps.
Matt: That's actually the one I was gonna say, that's my favorite shirt too.
Marisha: I like your displacer kitty you've got.
Matt: Displacer kitty's kind of cool. Adorable.
Taliesin: I like your shine on me shirt.
Matt: Oh God. If you guys haven't watched. Chris Dane Owens, on YouTube, Chris Dane Owens, Shine on Me. It's a music video, watch it. Chris Dane Owens, Shine, or Shine on Me, YouTube, do it.
Taliesin: I love that you own the shirt from it.
Matt: I bought a shirt from it, 'cause it's that amazing, I had to.
Travis: Did anyone tell Pike that Scanlan killed the naga for her?
Matt: I don't think someone's done it yet.
Liam: Scanlan had his first kill. You saw it, right?
Matt: You saw it on the stream.
Ashley: I saw it, me, Ashley saw it, but Pike did not hear about it yet. Who knows, that could be the thing that seals the deal. I'll be like, you killed the naga? Okay, let's do this. (all laugh)
Marisha: Any betrayals in the game?
Matt: No betrayals, disagreements, and occasional--
Travis: Trippings and beat-downs.
Matt: And stealing of flying carpets.
Ashley: I actually did step, I kind of did hurt Liam one game. Or Vax.
Liam: The game we played together? We did just the two of us one night.
Ashley: There were some of the girls changing in a room.
Matt: I forgot about this.
Liam: I was very curious to see you naked. But that's kinda fallen on the wayside.
Ashley: Vax was very curious to see what a gnome looked like naked.
Liam: Never seen it before.
Marisha: So you did a little peeping tom?
Liam: Why wouldn't I wanna expand my horizons?
Matt: So he rolled stealth.
Ashley: So he rolled stealth, and he did, and saw or whatever, and then when I came back out, and I found out about it.
Liam: Looked good, it was compact.
Ashley: It was just a small human. And I think I stepped on your foot, and gave you some damage.
Liam: Maybe a hit point.
Ashley: Yeah, a hit point or two.
Matt: You earned it.
Ashley: I earned it.
Orion: Somebody, seagullblaster--
Liam: No, Vax didn't spy on Vex, sorry, go ahead.
Orion: Asked-- Tiberius said something about the Palestone, and what it is, and this is, somebody asked a different question, this is kinda gonna answer both. I, and everybody else, wrote backstories for Matthew to essentially give him so he could construct our universe. Tiberius' particular quest is looking for particular artifacts. Essentially I made him like Mulder. Nobody believes in the city that these things exist, except him, so the truth is out there kinda thing. So I made up these five different artifacts that do different things. And I don't know what they do until I might maybe find them, and if I do, it's up to him, to Matt, to determine what they are, if they are anything. They might be nothing, I don't know. I've found one item so far, and it's awesome, and all of us have given him bits and pieces, and that's how he constructs our story with things that you throw in yourself.
Matt: Yeah, and each player, all their story lines work into the world. Not all of them will happen immediately of course, some people have had personal encounters and story encounters already, some are yet to occur, and there will be points throughout the campaign where the party will probably have to move and individually deal with each person's story to some extent.
Marisha: Dealt a little bit with each person.
Matt: Touched a little bit like-- In Eman, we've seen Vex and Vax's father.
Liam: Vex and I ran into to our father again for the first time in many years, it was a little frosty.
Matt: Had a new family.
Liam: Have a little half sister.
Travis: Matt, you have a favorite voice? And does it hurt to do the gnarly monster voice?
Matt: If you do it for an extended period of time it can be kind of shitty.
Ashley: I don't know how you do this new one.
Travis: Breathing in and out.
Liam: That's inward singing, man.
Travis: It is inward singing.
Liam: And then I'm fucking singing, and then--
Matt: Actually, it's funny, a bunch of my NPCs that I've done since high school have ended up turning into characters I've booked. I'll go into an audition and be like, "I'll go ahead and do Nutibe Curios, from my Second campaign," and I'll end up doing that character. Alof in Pillars is a character I NPCed back in high school.
Liam: That's awesome.
Taliesin: They still haven't heard my favorite voice from this campaign yet. 'Cause we haven't gone back to the city yet.
Matt: Oh, Gilmore?
Liam: Gilmore is a wonderful magician who owns a shop.
Orion: Was that the fancy--
Liam: Yes, in the city of Eman, he's got a big friggin' crush on me, and wants me. Wants me and some day you and I will actualize that.
Matt: We'll have to roleplay that.
Liam: Maybe in a game. Maybe not.
Travis: What do we think is taking over the hive mind?
Matt: What do you guys think is taking over the hive mind?
Marisha: Well we know it's named--
Orion: Obviously some butthole.
Ashley: I think I might have an idea.
Travis: Yeah, you had a vision that we don't even know about yet, right?
Ashley: Well.
Travis: Taking those mushrooms, having those visions.
Ashley: Taking those mushrooms.
Liam: Someone asked how do game devs find us for acting work? We all audition, hundreds of people audition, for every role in Los Angeles, we all just try. Today I worked on a superhero game, and the guy who was directing me for voiceover said, "hey, so what are you doing for the rest of the day?" And I said, well, I'm gonna go to the gym, I'm gonna do this, then I'm gonna go do that, do you know about that D&D show that a couple of us are doing? And he's like, "yeah, I heard about that." And the guy who had written the game went, "yeah, I've watched every episode." (all laugh)
Matt: So awesome.
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Ashley: Someone wants to hear Gilmore's voice.
Taliesin: I think we should save that for, wait until they actually meet Gilmore.
Travis: Yeah, we can't give it away.
Matt: Gilmore's a fun one.
Ashley: Gilmore's awesome.
Matt: Gilmore is very Broadway. He's very--
Taliesin: Not the gargoyle.
Matt: No, no. I could see him being a character in a John Waters film.
Taliesin: Oh my God, yeah.
Ashley: Totally.
Liam: Give him a pencil-thin mustache.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm trying to catch up.
Travis: Greater overall motivations?
Matt: That may or may not be secret, depending on the characters.
Marisha: What is each person's favorite D&D monster?
Travis: A dead one.
Liam: I liked it when Grog got it on with a, what was it, a nymph?
Travis: What?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: You don't know man, I went through the portal, handled my business like a champ.
Liam: In the air.
Travis: I don't kiss and tell. Nobody knows. I got what we were supposed to get.
Liam: A nymph could have attacked us, but Grog looked her in the eye, and she liked what she saw. Then he disappeared for a little while, and he came back and he was in a really good mood.
Travis: I flashed her the look, man. She was mine, what can I say?
Taliesin: I like the little green gelatinous cubes. I think they're fun, and then if you make 'em right, you can just make 'em out of jello, and eat them when you're done, that's awesome.
Matt: I don't wanna answer that question necessarily, because I might be using them in the campaign at some point.
Orion: Which one?
Matt: Nothing.
Ashley: So that means we haven't used 'em yet.
Matt: But overall, I just love the tarrasque because it's like the game ender. It's the godzilla. It's the one DM's move where he's like, "I'm done with this campaign, hey guys, you're gonna fight a tarrasque, either you're all gonna die, or you beat it, and you beat the game!" So the tarrassque is always fun.
Orion: Is it the final boss?
Liam: I've always been fascinated with the mind flayers. You're fucking throwing an army of them at us. 'Cause they're dangerous.
Matt: Yeah, they're terrible.
Liam: And they're so outside of the norm.
Matt: And hey you stealthed up, and pretty much killed one in one round today.
Orion: That was insane. When the mud on the face, and the stab in the fucking back of the head.
Matt: You guys black ops'ed that entire barracks.
Liam: I'm proud of the knife.
Taliesin: I know what you're talking about.
Travis: Grog and Scanlan have no bastard children, that we know of. Or that you can prove.
Liam: Other streamed D&D games, like Rollplay hosted by itmejp?
Travis: No.
Liam: No. Maybe we will, though.
Orion: I won't.
Liam: Everyone play Dungeons & Dragons.
Ashley: My favorite NPC character is a little butler who I think became--
Travis: Yes!
Ashley: He's the cutest little thing you will ever see, and I think now he works at--
Taliesin: He works for us now.
Matt: Yep, you guys hired him, and he's currently helping keep your Keep in good shape.
Ashley: What's his name?
Orion: The old fellow, right?
Matt: I'm trying to remember, I'll have to go look at the list again. I have so many NPCs, I have a hard time.
Ashley: He's just the sweetest little thing you ever did see.
Matt: Grog's flatlined intelligence, anything like that happen before? That was the first of that type of situation.
Travis: I went unconscious once 'cause I fell, how far did I fall?
Taliesin: Wow, you fell.
Orion: Oh, that was a crazy one too.
Matt: They were there fighting in an underground cavern, and at the very, very top of this giant, like 170-foot ceiling, which they had all kinda floated up to, and put a rope, anchor in.
Travis: I was ready to Toro the bull.
Matt: The first umber hulk you guys ever encountered, ended up pushing Grog out of the hole, bullrushing him. Had the rope tied around his waist, but unfortunately Grog weighs about 600 pounds, rope snapped, and he took enough damage to go from full health to unconscious and bleeding out in one round.
Marisha: 'Cause he confused you, right? And you just hari-karied off the hole?
Travis: I was gonna dodge and be all awesome, and say ole or some shit, but I was just out.
Marisha: That was when I was a spider tiger. 'Cause I cast Spider Climb on myself, and I was in tiger form, so I was spider climbing all over the place.
Matt: That's also one of my favorite risky rolls, which was after that happened, Tiberius, you pushed the umber hulk onto the ground, or through the hole, it fell.
Orion: I had this amazing spell with Pathfinder called Aquasphere, orb, and you can like, capture large creatures. I literally can waterbend a sphere and carry this dude and drop them down, it was amazing, I miss it so much. Continue the story.
Matt: So essentially Tiberius decided, 'cause Grog was unconscious, and the creature was down there. All of them were stuck 170 feet up, in this little hive essentially. Tiberius said fuck it, he jumped out of the hole, swan dove down, and cast Featherfall on himself at the last minute, had to make a concentration check because of the wind rushing past, and having to cast a spell while falling. It's a very difficult thing. He had about a 40% chance of success, 60% chance of instant death, and he made the roll. I love risky moments like that so much, I love 'em.
Travis: It was pretty legit.
Orion: I did it again and held that fucker, it was intense.
Marisha: I'm wondering when we're gonna face a beholder.
Matt: That'll be nasty.
Marisha: That's my favorite D&D monster.
Orion: With all the eyes?
Marisha: They're like a big floating head with a giant eye, and they've got tentacles, with eyes on the end of 'em, and each eyeball does a different ray of effect.
Travis: A beholder?
Matt: Nasty.
Travis: You know what that is too?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: They're nasty.
Ashley: Bad news bears.
Marisha: They're super awesome. One of these days we're gonna fight one.
Matt: One of these days.
Liam: They're a signature character of Dungeons & Dragons. They represent D&D.
Travis: What made the dwarves get bigger today in the battle?
Matt: That's actually an ability of the duergar.
Liam: Viagra.
Matt: Yeah. They can summon through sheer force of will, and just the way they've been bred over time, they can increase their form for a short time to increase their damage, and be just a general asshole, so. It's an ability the duergar have.
Travis: Long lost son.
Liam: I'm gonna guess that none of us have been to Sweden?
Matt: I have.
Ashley: My dad was from Sweden.
Matt: That's awesome. I've been to Gothenberg.
Taliesin: That's not surprising.
Orion: I have not, but I would like to go.
Marisha: Yeah, who wouldn't want to go to Sweden?
Liam: Makes sense. Pale and blonde.
Matt: Have you been?
Ashley: Never been.
Matt: It's beautiful, I spent two weeks in Gothenberg, Sweden, on business years ago. It was gorgeous. Food was amazing. Nothing like walking down the street and seeing a giant gothic stone structure with an archway and a gargoyle perched, and you walk in and it's a 7-Eleven. It's pretty hilarious. All the architecture there is old, but it's been repurposed, it's great.
Liam: If you had to choose would you pick to receive an extra level, or Matt's hair?
Matt: God damn it.
Liam: Matt's hair. (all laugh)
Ashley: Hair, obviously.
Marisha: Receive an extra level or Matt's hair.
Travis: You can't get hair like this without unicorn blood. My God.
Matt: I'm gonna shave my head one of these days.
Liam: Shave his head, he can't DM anymore.
Matt: I'd wither. It's like Sampson. I would just like become this little raisin, I'd be David Tennant.
Liam: The beholder strikes for the-- mawp. Mawp.
Matt: Let's see. What are the questions we got up there?
Marisha: It is 11 38, by the way.
Liam: What is the most outrageous and unexpected thing to come from a natural 20? That was Scanlan.
Ashley: Probably the--
Liam: Scanlan as Burt Reynolds.
Marisha: Oh right.
Matt: We'll take about five more minutes of questions. Five or ten more minutes of questions, then we gotta take off.
Liam: How long will you be doing this show? 30 years.
Matt: Considering we've been playing for two and a half years, and everyone's level nine, we can keep going for quite some time. Whether or not we continue past that, means either we do a new campaign, or we go into epic or mythic levels? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I mean, I'd love to keep playing for as long as people wanna play, but also people get busy, life changes, we'll see how it goes. I'm in for the long haul as much as everyone else is.
Liam: Matt, multiple people are asking what the music is that we're hearing on the show.
Matt: What you hear in the show is a combination of a gentlemen named Kevin Macleod, who has a website called Incompetech, which he produces really amazing, royalty-free musical tracks. I've used them for many web series for many years. He's very talented, and I contacted him, and asked him permission to use on the stream. He's like, "yeah, anything on Twitch, go for it." And the other half are a lot of soundscapes I use from a company called Platemail Games, which make great custom RPG soundscapes, and some tracks that are just creepy, and dwarf cityscapes, and dark forest night. It's a great, great resource. Those are my two big ones for this Twitch stream.
Orion: And yes, we did roll for our starting stats.
Matt: Yeah it was 4d6, drop the lowest, arrange as desired. So it was a powerful campaign.
Liam: What was the most nail-biting moment the group has seen? It was Pike's death.
Marisha: Pike dying.
Matt: Definitely. Do you prefer being the DM, or do you like mixing it up and being characters? I never get a chance to play games really. It's kind of one of those, always a DM, never a bride circumstance.
Liam: You wanna play with my kid?
Matt: Yeah. I'll be an evil character and murder them all, you're going to regret it immediately, make 'em just cry.
Liam: "Listen, that's the game, suck it up!"
Matt: Yeah, turn it into Mazes and Monsters.
Taliesin: Is that why you play so much War Machine, is because for once you don't have to be responsible?
Matt: Probably. I occasionally, I got to play a game of Diaspora for a while, with Philip Eisner, the guy who wrote Event Horizon. So playing a sci-fi kind of horror-based universe with him running, that was great. That was very brief.
Liam: Matt, can you give us any teasers of things to come?
Matt: No. See as they happen, man, that's part of the fun, the mystery of it all. I know what's coming. I got stuff planned for years. It's gonna be fun.
Liam: Do you have any advice to get into voice acting? Learn to act, study acting, go to where the work is, keep acting, in anything, in fucking anything. Go to where the work is. Act.
Matt: What age did you play your first tabletop RPG game? For me it was Second Edition Dungeons & Dragons, and it was freshman year of high school.
Taliesin: GURPS, 13. I was, yeah, 13 years old, GURPS.
Ashley: Favorite tabletop games, not D&D?
Liam: Get Hulk Hogan to play.
Orion: That's not D&D?
Taliesin: Mansions of Madness.
Marisha: Mansions of Madness is great.
Orion: Is MTG, Magic the Gathering a tabletop? Is that considered tabletop?
Marisha: It's a card building game.
Orion: Magic.
Marisha: War Machine.
Matt: War Machine is really fun.
Marisha: I'm a Cryx player.
Matt: It's awesome.
Ashley: I'm just starting.
Matt: You're the awesome Retribution.
Orion: I'm Circle of Orboros.
Taliesin: We played with Scanlan, of course we do.
Travis: It said do you ever think about sexuality while playing, besides Grog, of course. Scanlan does, I'm sure other people have.
Taliesin: It's hard not to think about it with Sam.
Travis: We just pay for it.
Liam: Are we gonna release more background information of your campaign?
Matt: Yes, actually.
Liam: We are?
Matt: Time has been hard, but I'm trudging through. What I'm gonna make essentially is a video recap of the previous two and a half years of the campaign. I'm gonna narrate it, it's gonna be very simple. It's gonna be just information, with the occasional slides of stuff in the background. But I'm working on a video, kind of like your guys' intros, that'll be a synopsis of the story up until this stream stared.
Travis: Claymation, that's awesome, man.
Matt: I will destroy you, I will fucking stab you.
Liam: If you want, it's not much, but I have a Vine account that's under the name VoiceofOBrien, and I took a lot of Vine videos from our private game. So it's not a ton, but you'll see us acting like shitheads.
Travis: That's seven seconds at a time.
Marisha: Seven seconds at a time, yeah. I think I still have the video of you trying to woo the nymph lady.
Travis: Try?
Taliesin: That was a good video.
Marisha: It's basically just you flirting with my boyfriend.
Taliesin: I have some videos of the tarot game, and a couple of us
Travis: Matt is now a nymph.
Matt: Yeah, we sat there, and, hey man, I've had to flirt with quite a few of these people as characters, it's interesting.
Liam: Who's your favorite NPC that you brought to life for us?
Matt: Oh, that's a tough one. There's been a lot of good ones. I really enjoyed Grimthorn, the dwarf that was--
Liam: Clarota is pretty good.
Matt: Yeah, Clarota is great. He was the one eyed dwarf with the shave, that was taking you guys to the fighting ring. He was fun. I'm enjoying Balgus as well, he's a good one.
Marisha: Ballsack.
Liam: Ballsack.
Marisha: Do we have nicknames for all of our NPCs?
Matt: You know, I really enjoy Arcanist Allura Visoren.
Orion: So do I!
Matt: She's an awesome, powerful, headstrong elven sorceress, who is part of a, not a secret, but a very powerful circle of magic practitioners around the world, and also a member of the council of Tal'Dorei. She's one of the largest allies that this group has had through a lot of the adventure arcs, and I love playing her, she's great.
Liam: Grog, have you even thrown a gnome as an attack.
Travis: The very first time we played, I picked up Sam and chucked him across a room. That was full of a trap.
Marisha: Fastball special.
Travis: And it worked. It was awesome.
Matt: What character type would I play if I ever got a chance to play? I would probably be a bard. I wanna make a bard that actually conducts the battle. Meaning, sits there and watches the fight, and he's conducting, like music happens when other people attack. Cymbals go off, and drum beats, and all of his abilities are tied to music, so he's actually conducting the battle like a symphony. That's what I wanna make.
Marisha: That's cool.
Ashley: That's badass.
Matt: One day.
Liam: Would you ever play an evil character? My contingency plan, if I get killed, I don't know about evil, but he won't be as nice as Vax.
Matt: Evil characters have to be discussed with the DM. I'm iffy on the evil character, unless they have a good reason, and a personality that isn't going to completely derail the campaign. Doing an evil campaign, that's fine. But if you're building a character that is going to inherently be a troll, and basically diminish everybody else's good time in the story, it becomes a problem.
Zac: It's the internet though, man.
Matt: I know. If you make a cool, interesting evil character, that can be evil but still like, like a good example would be in Baldur's Gate, Edwin.
Zac: What if one of your guests, that came on for one night, would they be allowed to be?
Matt: Yeah, they'd be allowed to. They may not survive.
Orion: Tiberius might not--
Marisha: Or kill them.
Liam: I don't know about evil, but if I have to come back, I might be a lot more selfish.
Matt: In it cool news, tabletop columnist, offering to DM a game for me. I may have to hit you up on that some time. 'Cause that'd be awesome.
Taliesin: He deserves a break.
Zac: How do you remember all the voices that you've done of the NPC's over the years?
Matt: I make notes and audio files.
Travis: You do?
Matt: I do. As a reminder in case I forget.
Travis: Jarvis. (all laugh)
Matt: I have notes written next to every NPC, like an accent or dialect that I chose for them, a general texture. Kind of like what you'd see for breakdowns for a character you're auditioning for. I basically make that for each NPC to remind me of what I've done. And if it's a particularly weird voice that I don't know if I could replicate in the future, after the session I'll go and do a little audio file of me doing the voice so I can go back to it later.
Travis: You're a freak of nature, man.
Taliesin: Seriously.
Matt: Good question.
Marisha: There's a lot that goes into it. I think Matt, just to put it into perspective, for everyone in the chat room, I think Matt probably spends close to eight hours, at least, on each time before we play. Or I guess at least we used to.
Matt: For our big session, I'd spend as much time preparing as we did playing. I'll put it that way, I spend as much time preparing as we play. So for these sessions, I'm spending about three hours a week, preparing, what, three to four hours a week? For old sessions that was bigger.
Liam: Someone asked, what was the reaction to discovering you had a magic flying carpet? Which you can see if you go to Matt's YouTube channel. There's a video that Ashley made of us playing, and you see our reactions to that.
Marisha: Who was it, was it you, or Vex? That tried to float down with the carpet, and then we realized it was magic?
Liam: Yeah, underneath.
Marisha: But we tried to just use it like a parachute.
Matt: It was a crumbling tower, it was Allura's tower. You guys went into, realized she was missing, because the tower had been attacked. You set off essentially a defense system of her arcane tower, which caused it to crumble into a tiny pearl.
Orion: Tiberius jumped out the window and just cast Featherfall.
Matt: Yeah, and just kinda glided away. You turned into an eagle and grabbed the gnomes. The rest of the party had to try to rapidly escape a crumbling tower that was compacting on to itself.
Marisha: I think it was mainly the twins in the tower.
Liam: Hey, Grog almost died once. He fell from a great--
Matt: You fall a lot, but when you fall on to something, that thing is fucked.
Matt: All right, we're winding down here, 'cause we gotta leave here shortly guys. Two more questions.
Liam: Three more questions.
Zac: Closing messages before you guys go, too.
Matt: Oh yeah, all right, so we'll do a couple more questions, then we'll go to closing messages. Who wants to pick?
Liam: Let's make it a magic three.
Marisha: Let's do a good one.
Matt: Three, three questions, make 'em quick. Let's see.
Marisha: Waiting for a good one.
Matt: How much does Grog weigh? Grog weighs approximately 600 pound we decided.
Travis: Just under 700.
Matt: So he's kinda rough.
Travis: It's all muscle, bitch.
Matt: Yeah it is. Muscle and brains.
Travis: Muscle and wang. 500 pounds and a hundred-pound wang.
Matt: Any of you consider running a game for fans of the stream? Actually, I've run a couple games at conventions for some groups. I had a couple of sessions I ran, actually in conjunction with Wizards, they sent stuff out for us.
Taliesin: And for charity.
Matt: Yeah, we've had some charity D&D games out here in L.A. So we've done them before. I'd consider it if there was time available, and a venue that allowed it. So if it does happen, we'll definitely announce it here.
Travis: Best item in your inventory?
Orion: That's for a magic item?
Travis: Oh, did we already say that? I'm just blanking.
Orion: No.
Taliesin: It's hard to read this quickly.
Matt: You guys have some good questions.
Travis: My brain's turning into applesauce.
Ashley: I know, me too.
Liam: Do you realize how lucky you all are to have such a nice group of friends?
All: Yes.
Matt: Very much so.
Taliesin: The world is cold and unfeeling.
Liam: Let's close it on that. I love these guys.
Matt: And I like to think that this is, because there are so many good people out there in the world, and we were lucky enough to find each other through weird circumstances. And there are so many good people in the world out there, don't close yourself off to it. You'd be surprised how many awesome--
Travis: How long does it usually take the woman in the back to tie her boot?
Marisha: I'm multi-tasking.
Matt: No, that's the question we end it on. That's the question.
Marisha: I've just been tightening my laces while I've been kicking it back here.
Zac: I'm gonna squeeze in here really quick. So I have some thank you's I wanna call out while you guys are here. I figured they'd appreciate me calling them out the most while you guys were on screen. 'Cause they like you guys for some reason.
All: Aw.
Zac: So these are all people that have sent us stuff off Amazon, to help make the studio better. So Danielle Denny.
Ashley: Thanks Danielle!
Matt: Danielle, thank you so much Danielle.
Zac: Bradley Dealman?
Marisha: Dalman.
Matt: Bradley Dalman.
Liam: Do we know what they sent us? Can you tell us some of the things they sent?
Zac: I have, I-- Well I mean they're like-- new microphones for that station and lights.
Marisha: That's amazing.
Zac: Wii controllers.
Matt: Brad, thank you, that's amazing.
Zac: And other stuff for tech we needed that we didn't have. Shane and Russell said thanks for all your hard work, and everything you are doing.
Matt: Aw. Thank you Shane!
Zac: Ty Odlinger.
Ashley: Ty!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson.
Ashley: Timothy!
Zac: Timothy B. Hudson, he went nuts.
Matt: Timothy!
Taliesin: Triple threat.
Zac: Kathel T. Stockdale.
Ashley: Cool name, Kathel.
Zac: Yeah, that's rad. Luis Archuletta.
Matt: Luis Archeletta!
Ashley: Luis!
Zac: Steve Chua.
Matt: Steve!
Zac: Here's a little something to help you guys out. Another one from Chua, here's a little something to help you guys out. And I know there's more coming in, this is what we've got so far. Thanks everybody.
Matt: That's so cool guys, thank you.
Zac: And they also have asked that a couple of you guys come on Honesty Hour sometime.
Liam: What is that?
Zac: It's a show I do on Monday nights, where it's 100% no-holds-barred. I will answer any question that they ask.
Travis: What?
Orion: I would love to do that.
Travis: Sounds like a horrifying idea.
Zac: Okay, they've asked specifically for Ashley, they've asked for Matt, and as for, actually I think everyone has been asked at one point in time. So I'll say maybe I'll have you guys once a month.
Ashley: When is Honesty Hour?
Zac: It's usually Monday nights from nine to, whenever the fuck. Like it went to 1:30AM the other night.
Crew: Isn't it really an Honesty Time?
Zac: Don't do it! It's only for subscribers. It's not that bad, because they ask really great questions, a lot of them have been about how have you gotten through certain aspects of depression, or what kind of thing--
Marisha: Oh that's good.
Zac: It's pretty inspirational.
Liam: How many times have you been hit in the nuts in your life?
Zac: I can say twice. And would probably explained how it happened, and what I did. It's just story time. Sometimes the questions get a little inappropriate.
Matt: That's okay.
Zac: That's fine.
Matt: But like for the most part, the audience here's been so awesome, they're all super intelligent with great questions. I'd be down, I'd totally be down.
Ashley: Wait, is this Noncompliant?
Zac: Yeah.
Matt: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, I got the Noncompliant tattoo this week, actually.
Marisha: Oh yeah, I saw your picture.
Ashley: That's amazing.
Zac: We have a comic book show on Tuesday.
Travis: (air-horn sound)
Zac: Real talk with Zac. But thank you guys so much for doing this. The subscribers really wanted to do it, so hopefully you guys enjoyed as well. And we will come back next week.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yay!
Zac: Tomorrow, if you guys are at Wonder Con, are any of you guys gonna be at Wonder Con?
Taliesin: Saturday.
Marisha: I don't know, maybe.
Orion: I'll be there Saturday.
Matt: I'm sadly not gonna be there.
Zac: I will be there tomorrow from 12:30 to one, for a meet and greet, which I'm going to pretend is an autograph signing, and I'm going to bring my own pictures.
Matt: Yeah!
Zac: We're gonna have fun with it. Going in costume. Becca and I are going in costume, and then Hector and Ify will be at four. And then Hector and Ify are doing a Q and A, or no, a trivia game that night on the stage for Geek & Sundry and stuff like that. So Geek & Sundry will be there, you guys should stop by.
Liam: Thanks for all those greater than three's, guys.
Matt: Less than three's.
Taliesin: Greater than three, too.
Zac: The computer, the story behind that, is during the charity drive, we had a robot read off all the donation messages. And the robot would say, and when they made a heart, it would say, "we less than three."
Matt: So beautiful.
Zac: So we turned that into a thing.
Liam: (robot voice) We less than three you.
Matt: It fucks me up every time you do that.
Zac: Cool. Thanks guys!
Taliesin: Forgot you speak-and-spell.
Zac: Thank you so much.
Marisha: Bye.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome back, everyone, to the next episode of Critical Role! This week, we have a full party. We'll be continuing just after the climactic battle with the twisted beholder, K'varn. We're going to go ahead and play a couple of videos here while we're waiting for the rest of the party members to settle in, so we'll be back here in just a few minutes. Sit tight and we'll get this party started. We have some fun announcements, some cool gifts that came in we'll be opening towards the end of the session today, but we'll go into those details shortly, so see you in a little bit. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn!
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. (roar) With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by side-stepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, (knife scraping) the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods; she preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear-- her own stolen Trinket-- to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, guys! Welcome back. Thank you for your patience. We have the whole group, finally seem to have defeated the horrible atrocity that is 13th-level Los Angeles traffic. (cheering)
Zac: What's up, internet? I've got a quick announcement.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Guys, we have a big giveaway today, when we get to 3,300 subscribers. I think we're 50 away or around 48, something like that. When we get to 3,300, we're giving away a dice box, a signed t-shirt, a starter set, and a signed Player's Handbook all in one box for a lucky winner, so if you guys get those subscribers rolling in, that's what helps pay for this show and pay for the entire channel as a whole, so get on that! And we wanted to say thank you to Aaron's Books in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for sending us this stuff to give away to you guys. (cheering)
Matt: Seriously guys, seriously, that was so cool of you to send that out there, and we want to say, happy sixth graduation, Aaron, congrats to you, well done. (cheering)
Zac: Aaron's a little young to be running a bookstore. That's all I have to say.
Matt: I consider that a very fine entrepreneurial position. You're getting started young, good man.
Zac: So guys, enjoy the game.
Matt: Thank you so much, and thank you again, Aaron and Aaron's books. That's awesome, guys.
Travis: Who was that strange masked man just now?
Matt: I don't know, it's so weird. Okay, so a couple quick things. First off, thank you guys for coming back and watching. Last week we had a few members away, so we had a fun little mini-game with a few folks, some who had played before, some who hadn't, and it turned out very interestingly. I hope my DM's tips were helpful for some folks out there. There's been some great feedback, and hopefully we'll do more things like that in the future for off-days. So, thanks to you. Welcome back, we're getting back into the main story line. Couple other quick things I wanted to mention: first off a big shout-out, birthday shout-out to Kit Buss, our fantastic artist for the show. (cheering)
Travis: Happy Birthday, Kit!
Orion: We love you, Kit.
Ashley: Happy birthday!
Matt: She's awesome, she's amazing, and I've seen a couple little previews of the next piece of art she's been working on and it looks pretty awesome. I think you guys are going to dig it. So she's not done, when she's finished drinking her birthday shots, then I think we'll hopefully see that soon. (laughs) Awesome, thank you so much, Kit!
Marisha: Yes, shots first, then draw.
Matt: Exactly, it's priorities! Also, anyone have any announcements they want to mention before we start the game? Any upcoming stuff?
Travis: The Justice League thing!
Matt: That's true, yeah! DC Kids on Youtube just released their new Super Friends animated series that both me and Travis are in.
Orion: Who are you? Who do you guys play?
Matt: Well, you play Lex Luthor.
Travis: Lex Luthor, and you play Superman.
Orion: Son of a bitch!
Sam: Interesting choice.
Taliesin: You can feel the tension.
Matt: It's a really, really cute show, it's a lot of fun, it's very much a playback to the classic Super Friends cartoon, that kind of comedic atmosphere. You should check it out.
Sam: You're Superman?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: (Clarota voice) Does he talk like this?
Matt: Yeah, it gets a little weird around episode three. I don't think DC's happy with how we treated the license for that one. (laughter)
Travis: That's the best.
Matt: That's every character I do now. Matthew Mercer, reading for Superman: (croaking noise) Also, if anyone else has any other announcements they want to mention?
Marisha: Yeah!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: You go first.
Orion: Whatchamacallit, a few weeks ago me and Matthew wore these really cool shirts with the vermilion bird from Rubrum, which is in Type-0, the Final Fantasy that we're both in! That shirt was made from Greven, g-r-e-v-e-n, at Redbubble, and we wanted to thank him for those shirts, along with this awesome Final Fantasy shirt, made by August8913, where she did this super cool, it says Nine on the back, his says Trey. Thank you guys, for the really cool shirts.
Travis: Aw, yeah! Jumped on the jam, boogie-woogie jam-slam.
Marisha: I'm going to be at Lock and Load this weekend in Seattle, which is the War Machine Hordes con for Privateer Press.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah! It's awesome, I'm going to be dressed up in my Scar costume. It's going to be awesome, I'm going to be doing a big transformation with Espionage. Yeah, and we're actually going to be pushing the stream; they're going to be streaming it and Geek&Sundry is going to be hosting the Lock and Load stream, so tune in and watch me prance around at Lock and Load in Seattle.
Taliesin: Those are impressive shoes to prance in, by the way.
Marisha: Yeah, some intense stripper heels, yeah.
Orion: Who'd you play?
Matt: Kreoss.
Orion: You were Kreoss, by the way, War Machine Tactics, Matthew Mercer is Kreoss.
Matt: Kreoss, Asphyxius, couple other guys.
Orion: Yeah, yeah, check it out.
Matt: It's fun, it's on Steam.
Liam: Asphyxius?
Matt: Asphysius is the character's name, lich lord Asphyxius, he's bad in town.
Marisha: I'm Haley and Deneghra and Fiora.
Laura: We're going to be at MetroCon next weekend.
Matt: Awesome! MetroCon next weekend.
Travis: (sings) In Tampa.
Laura: (sings) In Tampa, Florida.
Travis: Tampa, Florida.
Matt: Okay. Real fast, before we get to that, I will be, for those who are near--
Marisha: You already did it?
Travis: How many did we have to go?
Zac: 50.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: 50 subscribers.
Matt: Well, we already hit the mark!
Marisha: Don't we normally hit that in, like, a show?
Matt: That works, you guys are amazing!
Ashley: Yes, that's awesome!
Orion: Thank you, everyone!
Matt: I'll finish my last announcement, then we'll go to that.
Zac: I'm going to go ahead and start the giveaway.
Matt: Go, start the giveaway!
Travis: When is the next giveaway?
Zac: We're going to do-- Those pictures already exist, they shared them with the chatroom. Yeah, so we're going to do this. We're going to do a whole other set of these when we get to the next 50.
Marisha: Oh, a whole other set? There's another one?
Zac: Technically, we have four sets.
Liam: See you in five minutes.
Matt: So we have four sets of those to give away. Every 50 subscribers another set goes out, guys, so that's amazing.
Orion: I could have Sam fart on this for you, if you want.
Sam: Again? Already done, friend, already done.
Matt: Whoa. Okay, there we go. (laughs)
Travis: The world just ended.
Matt: That was close. I just rolled a one on my camera save. Final announcement before we get to the game, for those who are-- (shushing noises)
Orion: Sorry. Okay.
Matt: Can't all talk at once. Also, this weekend I'll be in Sandusky, Ohio, at Colossal Con along with such great folks as Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, other fun greats--
Travis: Is that at the water park?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Son of a bitch.
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, because water parks are totally sanitary. Hot tub's going to be great.
Travis: The dysentery afterwards is--
Zac: Flyingsquid63 is the winner.
All: Flyingsquid63!
Matt: You are the winner of the first set. Congratulations, that's awesome.
Ashley: It's an awesome name.
Marisha: Oh look, and it's green. You're winning green speckled dice, like squid colors.
Matt: There you go, that worked out well, very Cthulhu-ian.
Marisha: I'm justifying. Shut up, Liam! (laughter)
Matt: Well awesome, so we hit our next 50, we'll do another giveaway, we have three more of those packages to give out, guys, so hopefully keep that up. All right, anything else or should we get back into the chaos?
Marisha: Yeah.
Ashley: I'm scared!
Matt: You should be.
Ashley: I really am.
Sam: We beat the bad guy! It's fine, it's all fine.
Matt: Where we left off.
Orion: I forgot to ask you something before the game, it's fine.
Matt: It's okay. The party, as they ventured deep into the Underdark beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, they sought and discovered Lady Kima of Vord, a folk hero, a paladin of Bahamut who had been captured and tortured by the duergar that lived beneath it. After saving her, they discovered that there was an even deeper, darker, more dangerous evil brewing beneath the surface. There was an illithid, or mind flayer, city of Yug'voril deeper within these cavern structures, and currently the Elder Brain of the colony was under the control of an entity known as K'Varn, they came to find out was a self-mutilated and advanced beholder, who had come into contact with a dark artifact known as the Horn of Orcus that was actually gifted many many, many many, like hundreds of years ago by the god of undeath himself, Orcus, to one of his avatars. Somehow it found its way to this beholder, and gave it enough power to where it gained complete dominion over this colony and these caverns as a whole. The party fought their way through and made a few allies, including the ousted mind flayer, Clarota, seeking to return to his colony, has been fighting alongside them, as well as Lady Kima, the paladin they came to save. Upon finding their way into the final cavern, they used their magic carpet to completely go around the giant city of Yug'Voril, perch on top of the temple in the center of the city, and using a polymorphed fomorian giant (laughs), cascading down hundreds upon hundreds of feet, through the glass structure on top, managed to break their way into the temple, after which a very dangerous battle with K'Varn the beholder took place. A number of very close calls. I posted the stats for them after the fight, if any of you guys got a chance to see it. They made saving throws where it counted, or we'd have a lot more party members that'd be permanently dead. But they managed to take him out; using Tiberius's Telekinesis, they tore the horn from its forehead and the beholder fell to the ground, unmoving and finally killed, as opposed to its undead form, and that's where we begin. As you guys all sit there looking around yourselves, adrenaline still pumping in your ears, the flow of blood.
Orion: Pike--
Ashley: That's me! What do you need?
Orion: Do you have spell of Restoration, the thing that can reverse stone?
Ashley: Yes, I do.
Orion: Clarota, what do you suggest we do? Do we stay, do we leave, or do we-- what do you? There are hundreds upon thousands of illithid rushing at us right now, and they don't like me very much, by the way--
Laura: We should get out of here!
Matt: At which point, Clarota turns to you and says, "You. Bring her." Points to Kima, who is still frozen in stone mid-wielding her maul.
Ashley: To carry her?
Matt: "Stay but a moment; I will talk to them."
Sam: Talk to the hive.
Orion: Very good. Wait, do you want her un-stoned, or still stoned?
Marisha: Well, hang on. Maybe before we unstone Kima, we talk about what we should do with the Horn.
Orion: This is exactly what has to do with the Horn. Is there any way, Pike, could you perhaps half-cast it and hold the spell, don't quite undo her legs from stone, I don't want her to be mobile. I want to ask her--
Ashley: I don't know if I--
Sam: If I may, very quickly, are you with us, Tiberius?
Orion: We will discuss that when we get out of here.
Sam: Because you disappeared for like, the whole fight. Are you with us?
Orion: I am with you.
Sam: Are you going to disappear again?
Orion: To be fair, Scanlan, I never disappeared to begin with!
Sam: Well, you weren't there when we needed you the most. You were out doing God-knows-what.
Orion: Quite the contrary. If it wasn't for me, you'd still be fighting that damn thing.
Sam: What on earth are you talking about?
Orion: Silence. (laughter)
Sam: Dispel Magic. Yes, I did.
Orion: Counterspell.
Sam: Do I have a will save?
Orion: No, you're done, you're quiet.
Matt: That low enough level? No, unfortunately.
Orion: The idea, which I will share-- we don't have time to do that--
Sam: I turn him into a goat.
Orion: He has to say that, it doesn't work.
Matt: I know that. (laughter)
Orion: So the idea is, Pike, if we ask her why she wants the horn, if there is any other reason but to destroy it, we have to--
Sam: Okay, then I'll Banish him.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: How about-- well, hold on.
Taliesin: He can't stop it, he can't talk!
Matt: Also requires verbal casting.
Sam: I have to touch him, right?
Matt: You also have to be able to speak.
Sam: Fuck!
Matt: So while you're talking to them, Scanlan is tapping you and mouthing words angrily.
Orion: The idea is, if she doesn't want to destroy it, I say there's something awful, and Keyleth, I believe you want to destroy it, yes?
Marisha: Well, yes, I mean why does she want to take it back up to the surface if it's that terrible?
Orion: I know this is, did you say Orcus, is that his name?
Matt: Orcus, yes.
Orion: This thing is no good at all.
Marisha: Why don't we just throw it in some lava?
Orion: Where is some lava? I would much like to do that.
Marisha: Well, we're around lava, right?
Travis: We were.
Laura: We're not around lava now.
Taliesin: It's a thing of earth. Perhaps taking it to the surface is necessary to destroy it. Why don't we have a conversation with her?
Orion: But she wanted to take it back to Emon. That is not appropriate, we need to destroy this.
Taliesin: Let's get some information first.
Orion: I dispel Silence.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's get some information, let's figure out--
Sam: Oh hi, hi there.
Orion: Sorry, I just wanted to get the point across.
Ashley: I can un-stone her.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her, it's not like she can take it from us.
Ashley: That's my last 5th-level spell, so we might need to rest.
Taliesin: If something horrible happens, we're going to run anyway at this point.
Matt: I assume you guys have come down in here then.
Orion: I'm staying up, can I not--
Sam: Then how did we have this whole conversation?
Orion: Oh, then I'd be down there.
Laura: I was planning on staying up. I'm not leaving Trinket up there.
Matt: Okay. Good.
Taliesin: Why don't we find out what happens next? And if we have to, you can teleport us out of here, correct?
Orion: Oh, I have a wonderful escape plan.
Marisha: Okay, so Clarota, how much time do we have before something happens next?
Matt: As you say that, Clarota turns, and the two stone doorways on each side of the temple shift open and you notice three mind flayers glide in from the side of the room.
Laura: I notch my arrow.
Orion: No, no! Stop, no don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Matt: Two small, bi-pedal, brain-like creatures.
All: No! No.
Matt: At which point, Clarota puts his hands up like this.
Travis: I'm grappled, so.
Matt: Yeah, you're still being held back, but you can try to break from the grapple if you want to roll an athletics check.
Travis: (laughs) I would like to, just because these things ate my fucking mind away. Seven.
Matt: Nope, you're still held against the bars.
Taliesin: You're like an extra in Big Trouble in Little China.
Travis: Oh, it's a 12! I looked at acrobatics.
Matt: Still not enough, unfortunately.
Ashley: Wait, but I cast-- nope, never mind! Keep going!
Matt: Okay. As they begin to move in, and are hovering forward, looking around the room, taking in the scenery, but they're all focused toward the center, they're all just moving towards the Elder Brain. And they make their way up towards it, looking very intent and very frightened at the prospect of what maybe has happened in this room. As they all approach, you can see that low, dull, kind of purplish glow of the Elder Brain is still pumping, but slowly brighter and brighter, almost like it's coming to more life. You can hear the cage rattling of the various entities that are still inside, like the one that's still grappling Grog off to the side. The horn of Orcus, which is still being held aloft by your Telekinesis spell, is just hovering through the air, slowly rotating on its own, little strips of K'Varn's flesh still freshly tumbling from the side.
Orion: And it's at the halfway point between where she is and where I'm standing.
Matt: So right here?
Orion: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Not this big, of course.
Orion: It's really heavy, guys!
Matt: As they all move towards the center, Clarota, with his hands up, turns around, pulls back the hood, and steps towards the other mind flayers, hands stretched out, moving up to the point here.
Ashley: (whispers) Can you instill an inspiration?
Sam: Inspire him? I think he's pretty good on his own.
Orion: "Don't do anything." I'm saying this on the ears.
Matt: The three illithid look over and notice Clarota, and there's a good 20 or 30 seconds of silence as they just look at each other. At which point, Clarota kind of turns around to the rest of the group and looks at them, looks at all of you and lowers his head a little bit as the mind flayers move in towards Clarota, one reaches over and pulls the cap from the back of his head, removes it, at which point Clarota raises up, and if you think you've ever seen an entity with tentacles for a mouth smile, the creases in his awful, rubbery, fleshy face almost give a look of joy, of rediscovered connection, and he looks out to the rest of you and bows a head for a second. I need Grog, Scanlan, Tiberius, Vax, and Pike to all make--
Travis: Tiberius, if he fucks us.
Sam: I think he's about to.
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Oh, I'm grappled! I'm raging, but. Fuck yes! Intelligence saving throws?
Matt: Intelligence saving throws.
Travis: Thank god I rolled high.
Orion: Natural 20.
Travis: (laughs) I get a negative two modifier, that's such bullshit. (laughter)
Matt: Not very wise, there, Grog.
Travis: 17.
Sam: Is this a charm?
Matt: This would be-- no, it would not be.
Marisha: So wait, am I still an elemental? Is that the deal?
Orion: It's 23.
Matt: 23, 20. Scanlan?
Sam: 12.
Matt: 12. Pike?
Laura: She needs better dice.
Ashley: I rolled a six.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Ashley: Six total. (laughs)
Travis: Oh. 17.
Matt: Okay! So. Currently, all the mind flayers at once, including Clarota, angrily lash out with a Mind Blast. You feel your brains all of a sudden fill with searing, horrible pain. Some of you manage to shrug it off, but the rest of you find your bodies locking in place. All right, everyone who failed their save, which would be-- Keyleth, what'd you roll?
Marisha: You didn't have me roll.
Matt: Oh, you need to roll as well, sorry, you're in the blast there. You're still an earth elemental.
Marisha: I thought I was immune to this kind of stuff. (groans) What do I-- not good.
Matt: Not good? All right, that'll be 22 points of psychic damage to Grog, to Pike.
Travis: I passed, right?
Matt: No, you passed this. You're fine.
Laura: Teleport us out of here!
Orion: It doesn't work like that. It's what I was trying to say earlier!
Matt: Scanlan, you are currently stunned, you are actually unable to physically move. Pike, as well. The rest of you manage to resist the Mind Blast, but at this point in time you can now see that this crew, including Clarota, now reconnected with its people, your purpose serving its end, you're about to be swarmed by the rest of the entire city.
Travis: Son of a bitch, taint, fuck!
Matt: Let's roll initiative, guys.
Marisha: We should've gotten out of here!
Travis: I never trusted that Magneto motherfucker! Fuck.
Matt: All right, so. 25 to 20?
Laura: 21.
Marisha: 21, as well.
Matt: Nice. 20 to 15?
Orion: 19.
Taliesin: 17.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: All right, 15 to ten?
Liam: 14.
Sam: 13.
Matt: All right, Grog?
Travis: Eight. Against mind flayers. We're fucking fighting brains and mind flayers again.
Laura: We're all going to die.
Marisha: Okay, wait, you guys run.
Matt: Vex, you're up first.
Marisha: I can start bringing down the palace.
Laura: I'm stuck at the top. Until we can run, we're stuck, because there's only one flying carpet.
Travis: Tiberius has got something for us, right?
Laura: I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the Elder Brain and shoot Hail of Thorns into the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yes! I like that idea!
Marisha: I'm going to start bringing down the temple! Are we okay with that?
Travis: We're still in it.
Orion: Not while we're still in it.
Marisha: Well, I mean it'll take some time, I'm sure.
Travis: Or it could happen really quick.
Matt: As you guys do notice-- you guys are beginning to see what looks like shadows seemingly coming out from the outside, and you hear what seems to be slight cackling of things sort of in the doorways. So you're shooting Hail of Thorns down into the Elder Brain? Go ahead and roll for the attack.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 will hit, yes.
Sam: We're going to be dead in ten minutes.
Matt: What, the teleportation one?
Orion: We'll talk about it later. Plan B, it's ten minutes.
Matt: One minute.
Orion: Sure!
Matt: Pretty sure it's one minute
Marisha: Wait, does this mean you can go and we'll distract?
Orion: No, don't look at it! You said one minute, that's the DM, DM is god.
Laura: Do I roll regular damage, plus the Hail of Thorns?
Matt: I thought it was.
Travis: If someone asks you if you're a god--
All: You say yes.
Travis: You shouldn't look! You shouldn't waste your time.
Matt: Spellcasting time  one minute.
Orion: Oh, yes, I'm so glad I'm wrong.
Laura: 39 on the first hit.
Orion: How many of us are down there?
Ashley: 39?! Yes!
Marisha: All of us except for Laura and Trinket.
Taliesin: And I'm on the carpet, so I can head that direction.
Laura: And then 18 for the second.
Matt: Okay, so you release the first Hail of Thorns. The arrow shatters into a whole--
Laura: And anything within five feet takes damage, as well.
Matt: That'll be all four of them. How much damage do they take?
Laura: They take the same amount unless they make--
Matt: Unless they make a what? Do they have a saving throw against it?
Laura: Oh wait. Yeah. They take half damage on a saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Against what? So two of them make it, two of them don't.
Marisha: Look, look, I do double damage to objects and structures. That's the thing, I'm really good at tearing shit down.
Orion: Now, sometimes fighting isn't the right thing to do!
Marisha: That's why I'm not talking about fighting, I'm talking about collapsing buildings!
Matt: All right, so Clarota and the one nearest to it get behind a pillar for a second and manage to reduce the damage a bit, but the other two are completely pierced all over their bodies where shattered pieces of these kind of jagged thorn arrows exploded all over them and the Elder Brain. The pulsing begins to-- you hear this shrieking in your mind, like the actual presence of the Elder Brain is starting to yell out in pain. You feel it's hardy but hurting. I mean, it's very hefty, it's a large chunk of matter, so god knows how long it would take to take that one down, but it's definitely-- (laughs) it hurt. It's not happy with that. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are?
Laura: I want to do my second attack.
Matt: Yeah, that's right!
Laura: Yeah. 15?
Matt: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. You actually fire down and it hits the stonework and the arrow splinters against it. Stay where you are?
Laura: I don't know what else to do. I'm stuck up at the top.
Matt: Jump? What could possibly go wrong! Okay, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Sam: Keyleth!
Marisha: I think my best use-- I agree we need to get out of here, but I'm going to--
Matt: You have shadows moving in from the two open doorways on each side right now.
Marisha: What, so the Elder Brain-- is this a wooden well, or a stone well? What is this?
Matt: Essentially it's a giant stone platform that houses the Elder Brain at the center.
Marisha: Here's what I can do. I can start breaking the well, or I can start blocking entrances. I can start pulling down--
Travis: That one, the second one.
Taliesin: The second one.
Marisha: The second one?
Travis: The second one, close the doorway.
Marisha: All right. Who's coming in from where?
Matt: This is one doorway. That's the other.
Travis: I thought he said it was big.
Marisha: All right, I am going to-- I can make it there, right? That's 35 feet?
Matt: That-- ooh, that's maybe not enough. Yeah no, that's longer than 35 feet.
Laura: Just bull rush and tear down the well.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Fuck it, do what you want to do.
Matt: What do you want to do?
Marisha: All right, all right!
Matt: Just letting you know, just putting this into perspective, here: you're fighting four illithid in the room. You have a city swarming on you right now.
Laura: We need to get out! Or take down the Elder Brain.
Marisha: All right. I am taking down the doors.
Matt: Okay, what are you doing? Are you casting a spell?
Marisha: No, I'm going to start-- can I bull rush, not necessarily right next to the door but like right here, and I'm going to elemental-slam into the wall and siege monster this.
Matt: What's the movement speed of the earth elemental?
Marisha: 35 feet.
Matt: 35 feet? As it's still able to move through stone as well?
Marisha: Yeah! Well, actually, no. When I move through stone I think I can move 60 feet!
Matt: Okay, it is a thick floor. You actually shift into the stonework of the flooring itself and coast through, popping up right out there. That'll get you right at the doorway. You can see there is a slow spiraling incline, like a small-- like an inclined pathway that you can see four illithid making their way up right now, with some large looming stomping sounds coming up behind them.
Marisha: Perfect! So I materialize, using my girth to take up the door, and then I just go (deep voice) boom! And start bringing it down.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make your slam attack or attacks, depending on how many--
Marisha: Slam, I guess.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Get it, Keyleth. (cheering)
Marisha: 26!
Matt: 26, okay go ahead and roll damage on that. Since you are an earth elemental, you do extra siege damage against structures, don't you?
Marisha: Correct. Double damage. So (laughs) okay. So does full damage, plus five, so that's 21-- 42 points of damage.
Ashley: Yes!
Matt: 42 points of damage. So the stone structure, which is pretty rigid and this is an old, old structure; the strange, weird, non-Euclidean design of it has a slight warbling feel to it. You take both of your earth elemental fists and slam them into the side. As you do, the structure gives way and a good 30 feet or so crumbles down around you. You can feel the stones raining onto you. Because of your proximity, you take four points of impact damage.
Marisha: I like it! It feels good! This is what I bathe in!
Matt: This entire doorway is ruined, and there's a good 15-foot pile of stonework now blocking that entranceway.
Marisha: 15-foot pile?
Matt: Yeah. But there's a hole above it, where the stone fell through. So there is about 50 feet up a section of the wall that is collapsed down.
Marisha: Whatever, it'll make it harder. Right, that's my turn.
Matt: Okay, do recall that mind flayers do levitate.
Travis: Aw. (groans) God! Maybe not now, they don't?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Yeah, okay--
Matt: You can also see forms swarming through the other doorway over there.
Laura: Teleport us!
Orion: This isn't good.
Laura: Fly us! Get us out.
Orion: How far? Scanlan's only like a foot away from me, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: I'm right next to him!
Matt: Yep.
Orion: Oh!
Travis: Beam us out, Scotty.
Orion: Shit. Okay. I cast Fly on myself.
Sam: (laughs) Bye, Tiberius! (laughter)
Orion: I redact that, actually. Is it possible-- I'm at least standing next to him, right?
Matt: You are.
Orion: I don't have to use a move action right now. I can, like, look at him.
Sam: I leap!
Orion: Okay, can I give him-- can I take off my Ioun Stone as an action, and swap his crown?
Matt: No, I'm pretty sure-- if the item says "attunement" on it, you have to spend a short rest attuning yourself with the weapon. If either of them does.
Orion: But he didn't. He hasn't attuned himself to the thing yet.
Sam: To what?
Matt: Right, but your Ioun stone-- you mean take it from him?
Orion: Yeah!
Matt: You would have to attune it to yourself in order to use it.
Orion: How long does it take?
Matt: It takes a short rest.
Orion: Shit! Okay, that changes everything in a very bad way.
Matt: What are you doing? The other doorway isn't blocked, you have mind flayers running in, you have probably more and more swarming from underneath the temple, probably over at some point, from what you've seen of the temple structure.
Orion: Okay, so I'm going to attempt to crush the Horn. With a thousand pounds of pressure.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Because my Telekinesis is still going.
Matt: That's true.
Orion: I can't do anything else without dropping this thing because as soon as I do anything else, I drop the horn. So I have to do that first.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action, go ahead and roll for that, for the crushing of Telekinesis.
Travis: Oh god.
Orion: What am I adding?
Matt: You're adding your modifier, which I think is five.
Orion: Oh, 23.
Matt: As you focus intensely, you feel that the Horn itself-- the sheer force of the artifact is far too powerful for your meager magic to have any sort of effect on its physical structure.
Orion: I thought so.
Matt: As you focus your arcane intent on crushing it, you feel almost like the back of your brain begins to crawl with cold energy, and if you could hear-- if you could hear laughter come from something that is inanimate, you're hearing it coming from the Horn right now.
Travis: Fuck that horn.
Matt: That's your action.
Orion: I'm going to--
Laura: Float it into the Bag of Holding!
Orion: I'm going to maneuver around the chaos because I'm not within range of anybody to hurt me, right?
Matt: Not currently, no.
Orion: So I'm going to hop on the carpet.
Liam: This is all taking six seconds, by the way.
Matt: 30, that's as far as you can get.
Orion: Well, I can run.
Matt: You already used your action to Telekinesis.
Orion: Oh. That's stupid.
Matt: That's how it works.
Orion: "Hey, Percy!" (laughs) That's my turn, that's all I can do. And I still maintain the thing.
Matt: Okay. That brings us-- end of Tiberius's turn, to Percy.
Taliesin: I'm going to start flying straight up, and while I'm flying straight up, I'm going to take... two shots with the Pepperbox at the big brain.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Sharpshooter. That's a 21? That's 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Taliesin: And should I do both hits?
Matt: Yeah, roll both.
Taliesin: Oh, and-- no, that's right, I don't critical at 19?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: No, I need a specialty. Damn it! And that hits, so both hit, and they're both with Sharpshooter, so that's nice. (sings) I haven't pulled my dice out yet. There we go.
Liam: Come on, gunslinger!
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice! 25 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: All right, gotcha.
Taliesin: Oh, sorry. I forgot, sorry, four points of fire damage.
Matt: Okay, good. All right, so as you (gunshot) turn over the barrel of your weapon, fire again, the second one bursting into flame as it hits the top of the Elder Brain, you can see both bullets sink into the flesh. There's no impact; they just seem to be absorbed in by it. The flame one, you see a jet of flame go from the inside and the flesh of the actual large Elder Brain quivers for a moment. You hear another shrieking, angry pain growl in your minds just by the proximity of this entity. You don't see it doing too much to it, but it's definitely hurting it. That ends your turn?
Marisha: Things can hurt really bad and not do that much damage.
Matt: Clarota spins and comes up behind you--
Laura: Don't be a dick.
Travis: Remember our days watching Saved by the Bell together?
Matt: You are stunned currently, so it gets advantage on that. So that's 24. All right, so Clarota's tentacles wrap around your head-- (gasping)
Travis: Whose?
Matt: You immediately take 15 points of psychic damage and you are currently grappled.
Sam: And stunned.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: (sings) Grappled and stunned, so grappled and stunned!
Matt: All right, that comes to Pike! Pike, you're stunned currently, mind still reeling from the pain; go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Ashley: Ugh, okay.
Travis: We're just trying to stay alive.
Ashley: I just rolled a one.
Matt: Your physical form is still unable to pull yourself out of that continuous psychic pain, you're like (groans) trying to just tear your mind out of it, unable to do so. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I click my Boots of Haste and I'm going to-- where's the thingie, do we have a thingie here?
Ashley: What do you need?
Liam: The light.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: All right, great. How's this work? Like that. If I can run right between Pike and this little brain jerk right here, does that get me within five feet of Elder Brain if I'm there? I can't tell from the structure.
Matt: You can rush there, you would have to get up onto here.
Liam: Yeah, that's what I want to do, and then, I don't know. That's not my full double-movement, I don't know how that affects the number of attacks I have Hasted, but I just want to stab it as many times as I can, standing on top of this thing.
Matt: All right, got it.
Liam: Where's the meteorite die?
Orion: Fuck you, couch!
Liam: Using my poison dagger.
Travis: Prison shank that thing.
Liam: Yeah, yeah, I'm going to shiv him in his shank or shank him in his shiv, whichever is the more accurate phrase.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for attack twice.
Travis: Can you scream out "lobotomy" while you do it?
Matt: As a note, as you rush by, for an attack of opportunity, the intellect devourer does reach out and strike at you with its claws.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: Rolls a one. You just kick it off to the side, it rolls on its side, its brain matter (clunks) on the ground.
Liam: Do I get two or three attacks?
Matt: You get three if you use your bonus to attack.
Liam: First one misses. Second one is-- oh wait, the first was a 17, is that--
Laura: That doesn't miss.
Liam: Hit or miss, it's a brain, right, I'm standing--
Matt: Total 17? That would still-- it doesn't miss, but as you strike down for it, there's a psychic field that's defending it, and your blade is held at bay by the protective sphere.
Liam: Okay, then I'm using now dagger of venom is 26.
Matt: Okay, that does hit.
Liam: Okay, so that's four plus six is ten, because this isn't Sneak Attack or anything.
Matt: No.
Liam: That's ten plus a poison for a DC of 15?
Matt: Okay. It makes its saving throw. Rolled a 17.
Liam: So that was that, and then the third attack I'll go back to the keen dagger. 14.
Matt: 14. The second one strikes through, the poison tries to pulse through but once again it resists the impact; the third dagger comes down and before it even gets halfway towards, there's a blast of psychic energy from the inside of the containment unit that holds the Elder Brain that (boof) forces your hand back, the attack deflected entirely. That ends your turn. The other three illithids now go.
Ashley: I wish we had inspiration.
Orion: Isn't there a rope still hanging from there? Throw the damn rope!
Laura: You can climb it.
Liam: Yeah, I can probably get up 15 feet and hang there.
Travis: Yeah, I'm getting a massage right now.
Matt: This one's also going to turn around, reach forward, and its tentacles are going to attempt to wrap around Pike's head--
Travis: Don't you touch my friend.
Matt: That's going to be a 20?
Travis: A natural 20?
Matt: No, it's just 20. So Pike, you go ahead and take-- this'll be 15 points of psychic damage.
Liam: It was a good run, folks.
Marisha: What happened?
Laura: He rolled a 20.
Ashley: So he rolled a 20.
Matt: I rolled a total of 20. And you're stunned currently, so you take 15 points of psychic damage as you feel-- as you're trying to resist yourself, these cold tentacles wrap across the front of your field of vision, and you can feel this weird, toothy, pointy, biting sensation beginning to push towards the back of your skull. This one--
Ashley: That's it, that's all she wrote.
Matt: This one here is going to--
Laura: He's going to try to eat her brain!
Matt: Tiberius, that is a 15 versus AC.
Orion: Nope!
Matt: What's your AC?
Orion: 17, man!
Matt: 17, as you're rushing toward the magic carpet that just took off, yeah, you look over and the tentacles swing toward you, you duck just underneath and manage to avoid the attack. Now the two intellect devourers. One's going to go ahead and look up towards the magic carpet that's taking off and-- here we go. Oh, within ten feet? No, you're too far away. So instead it's going to go for you on top of the Elder Brain. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 20, natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20!
Sam: Needed that.
Laura: That's not to Matt, that's to the little brains.
Liam: The brains, the brains.
Marisha: Fuck you, little brains.
Matt: So you feel a similar blast of screaming energy, like you feel from the illithids, but it's more primal and more guttural. You manage to shrug it off in your mind and angrily look down at this weird, fleshy creature. The other one moves up and attempts to blast you again from the opposite side. Make another intelligence saving throw.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19! Once again you feel from the back of your brain this like stunning impact and you shrug it off looking over this way.
Liam: (jeering) I'm smart! (laughter)
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: I'm grappled and stunned.
Matt: Yeah, so go ahead and make your saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy. (cheering)
Orion: Boom!
Matt: You shrug off the stunned effect, you're currently grappled by the entity.
Laura: You're so smart!
Ashley: You're so smart!
Marisha: You're so smart!
Travis: Cardiac kid, come on now, here we go. Table's getting hot.
Liam: Aren't you inspired?
Matt: And then also make an intelligence saving throw.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Because he's also got the things on me.
Liam: Just say 20.
Sam: Seven. (laughs) Plus two.
Liam: Big nine.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I said big nine.
Ashley: He rolled a 20, so that's gotta mean something.
Taliesin: I think a nine is a big six.
Marisha: The 20 carries over one, right? (laughter)
Travis: Residual?
Marisha: You take the one and you carry it over.
Travis: Natural 20 residual.
Liam: I personally can't wait until we roll new characters next show.
Laura: No.
Marisha: Shut up!
Matt: Unfortunately, you're still stunned.
Sam: Still stunned? Oh, so I got off--
Matt: You resisted the mind effect, but the tentacles on your head are now locking your brain in place, and your eyes are kind of rolling back in your head as you feel the illithid's mouth begin to push against the outside of your head. Grog?
Travis: I've got to break my grapple, right?
Matt: Yeah. Just go ahead and roll an athletics check.
Travis: One.
Matt: A natural one?
Sam: This guy.
Matt: A natural one; it rolled a four!
Orion: Plus your strength! Oh, it doesn't matter.
Taliesin: It doesn't matter.
Matt: Okay. So it's still holding you in place; you have your axe you picked up off the ground with your chain of returning; you can't physically move from your position as it's holding you there.
Travis: The axe is across the room, remember?
Matt: Well, no, you threw it over here and retrieved it at the end of the battle.
Travis: Well that's a good, that's a good plus.
Ashley: (frustrated noise)
Marisha: The fuck!
Matt: So what do you want to do?
Laura: You could attack with your chain.
Travis: I can attack with the chain?
Matt: You have your axe with your chain of returning, you just can't move, but you can still throw if you want to.
Orion: Oh, awesome.
Marisha: Can you chop the dude's arms off?
Travis: I have no-- it's holding me, I don't think I can be like--
Ashley: Maybe the guy that has him, his tentacles or whatever?
Travis: I was going to try and save you.
Ashley: Well. That's far.
Travis: Can I reach the illithid-- it's far?
Matt: Well, you can throw to either of them right now. They're both bent over gnome heads, they're bigger--
Travis: Where's Scanlan?
Ashley: Why the gnomes?
Matt: He's here, and that's Pike.
Ashley: Why the gnome hate?
Marisha: It's rare. It's a rare delicacy.
Matt: You guys were right there.
Travis: All right, I can't-- I'm going to try and throw it at the illithid that's on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Ashley: Tasty gnome.
Liam: All the fans who implied that Matt went light on us the last game--
Travis: 22?
Matt: 22, definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Okay, it's just one, two, three. Shit balls. 14.
Matt: 14 points of damage, all right. That one, you throw the axe, it slams into the shoulder of the illithid that's grabbing on to him. You see it look up at you angrily and a large portion of its chest is now gashed open and blood is pouring from the wound, but it's still holding tight right now. I think that's going to end your turn.
Travis: No, I'm done.
Matt: Do you want to pull your axe back?
Travis: Yes, I would like to.
Matt: Go ahead and you (grunts). Go ahead and make your check.
Travis: What do I, what the fuck do I roll, to the thing. What do I roll? A 12?
Matt: Yeah. A 20, you have to roll a d20, that was a d12.
Travis: Okay, good. (laughter)
Travis: 18.
Matt: So you pull on the chain of returning and it yanks the axes out of the wound and you catch it in midair, preparing for the next round.
Travis: (laughs) The 12 was a one. (laughter)
Matt: All right, first round of combat over. Let's roll better, guys. This is looking really dire. Vex, you're up.
Ashley: Get it.
Sam: Save everyone.
Matt: You're up at the top, you have a clear view of everyone.
Marisha: That's true, you're the only one with a bird's-eye view.
Sam: Just run. Save yourself.
Matt: As it is, these two illithids look kind of hurt, these two look really rough, this one looks really rough, both of these guys haven't been damaged yet but they have low hit points.
Sam: Save yourself, start a new race of people.
Laura: I am going to attack--
Sam: Hunter's Mark!
Laura: I'm going to put Hunter's Mark on-- oh, my brother just died.
Liam: I fainted.
Laura: On the one attacking Scanlan.
Taliesin: Not on Scanlan, on the one attacking Scanlan.
Matt: Oh right, sorry. (laughter)
Travis: What did he do?
Matt: In the confusion--
Sam: (shrieking) Help!
Orion: Friendly fire!
Ashley: That was amazing.
Laura: 14?
Matt: 14 unfortunately does--
Ashley: Plus! Plus War God's Blessing?
Matt: You're stunned.
Ashley: But can't I just do it just because?
Matt: No, unfortunately.
Marisha: Once, just this once, please?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Laura: But he's bent over and I've got a bird's-eye view of him.
Matt: You know what? He is grappling and he is right in the way, I'll go ahead and give you advantage on that attack. Roll again.
Laura: Yes! So I just roll again?
Matt: Roll again. Take whatever it is.
Laura: 22!
Matt: 22 will hit, okay. Because it is a stationary position, completely engulfing, and you have such a great view from above.
Laura: Right? 11 points of damage?
Matt: Okay. Did you roll your Hunter's Mark damage?
Laura: No, I did not.
Matt: Don't forget Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I won't, though. Three extra. That's for Hunter's Mark.
Ashley: 14 total?
Matt: Okay, gotcha. That's your first strike.
Laura: Okay. On my second one, should I just try to attack him again, kill him? All right, I'm going to kill him, try to hit him again. 18?
Matt: 18. Okay! So both strikes (whoosh). Go ahead and roll for damage.
Laura: 16 plus-- 19.
Matt: 19, okay. Both arrows (zoomf, zoomf), one embeds itself in the wound that Grog had left with the axe and you see the body tenses. Clarota stares up at you with this beaming angry look on his face; you realize, oh shit, Clarota's the one that's going after Scanlan. Your second arrow you bring down and release and it pierces the side of its face, gashing through and embedding itself in the chest. You can see now Clarota's looking really rough, but he's still holding taut. This horrible thought goes into your mind suddenly, a familiar voice saying, "You've all done your work. Now it's time to feast!"
Sam: (gasps) He turned on us!
Laura: I knew he was going to do that!
Sam: What? None of us knew that!
Laura: I totally knew he was going to do that.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn; Keyleth, you're up.
Travis: I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. I don't trust Clarota. (laughter)
Ashley: Every week.
Travis: Every week!
Sam: You know who would help us right now?
Laura: Kima would help us, but she's stone.
Sam: Can we make her not stone?
Ashley: We can make her not stone, except we didn't get a chance to.
Liam: If we live, we're in store for so much I-told-you-so. (laughter)
Liam: It's a big if.
Sam: Maybe we should leave her. I don't want to deal with that.
Travis: Who's up?
Marisha: I can make, I'm going to-- aw, crap. I'm going to phase down, and I'm going to pop up, and I'm going to break the well that's holding the Elder Brain.
Ashley: Get it!
Matt: Okay, so you're going to pop up here? Over here?
Liam: No, not there!
Matt: Right there?
Marisha: Not where I might hurt Vax.
Sam: Well, that's anywhere.
Laura: Just do the other side!
Marisha: You might have to do, like, a flippy-poo off it.
Matt: So what are you doing on the well, you're just grabbing it?
Marisha: Can I? Can I flip?
Matt: No, it's embedded in the ground. What are you doing?
Marisha: Oh, okay, so I want to take and I want to just punch to crack a big side of it to help spill out the brains.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a slam attack on the side
Marisha: Bust the side of it open.
Ashley: And then we'll stomp on him and make brain juice.
Marisha: I mean, it's an item, it's a stationary rock, so what do I add? Oh wait, I add-- so plus-- sorry, I'm not used to this. Plus eight, 16?
Matt: 16? You slam into the side of this; you're not attacking the brain, you're attacking the stonework. You can feel there is some psychic resistance, but because you're not attacking the brain directly, your fist slams into it, making purchase in the stone. Go ahead and roll damage against the stone.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: Double damage on this.
Ashley: Big damage!
Marisha: 20 damage.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: 20 damage. The side of the stonework crumples inward. Pieces of the stonework itself seem to be jutting in toward the Elder Brain, but it's stopped by some sort of psychic resistance, but the whole side here to here is now just open entirely, and you can see now the hole, the mass of-- there's probably hundreds of various illithid brains that have slowly congealed into one large brain structure as now you can see the underneath area. The liquid it kind of sits in is now pouring out, down the side of the structure.
Marisha: Hope they have flood insurance. (groans and laughter)
Travis: That was the worst Schwarzenegger action line ever. (Terminator voice) Hope they have flood insurance, ja.
Marisha: The Geico slayer!
Travis: Holy shit. That was amazing.
Marisha: Flo just got real, all right? Flo just got real.
Taliesin: That's no better, actually.
Marisha: From Progressive Flo? All the flow of the-- you know what, never mind.
Matt: So you only have the one slam attack? Earth elemental doesn't multi-attack?
Marisha: Yes, just the one. My slam attack is--
Matt: Right. Cool.
Marisha: Oh no, wait! I have multi-- earth elemental makes two slam attacks!
Matt: That's good to know. Go ahead and make another one.
Marisha: I could have done that last time?
Matt: Are you attacking the stonework still?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm just going to take the other chunk and punch it.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say you used some of your movement to move this way. By the way, guys, you can break up your movement. You can move, attack, then move if you want to.
Marisha: You can?
Matt: Yeah!
Travis: Unless Tickle-me-Elmo is holding you by the cage.
Marisha: It's cocked. 16 plus eight, so 22.
Matt: That'll definitely do it; go ahead. Is that total damage? Oh, that's the attack. Okay, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Ugh, four plus-- 18 damage.
Matt: 18's fine. So you break out the second half and now the entire side of it is open. All the fluid just spilled out the side and you get the sensation this is very frowned upon. (laughter)
Matt: That ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up!
Travis: A tentacle frown.
Orion: So I rush up, and Percy takes off?
Matt: As a note too, just so you guys are aware--
Taliesin: I didn't know you were coming to the carpet, sorry.
Laura: Oh no, we never closed the other door!
Matt: You start seeing a series of other entities slowly making their way up from the downstairs tunnel area.
Sam: I think we can beat them all.
Orion: Seeing what's going on-- there's an illithid right behind me, right?
Matt: There is. Right behind you, yeah.
Travis: I thought she closed the door.
Laura: No, we didn't.
Matt: Yeah, the other door is open.
Marisha: I closed the one, but then he said that they could levitate so I decided it wasn't worth it.
Sam: Hey, man. Grog's being held prisoner by an 80-pound dude.
Orion: So I'm running off and then Percy takes off? So I can't get to him?
Matt: Yeah, he's (whoosh), you can't get to him.
Orion: Awesome.
Travis: I'm so ashamed right now.
Orion: I need a technical question. Can I move the Horn and let go of the spell so I can then do my turn? Or does that take a thing to do that? Like, I want to let it go--
Matt: No.
Orion: Good. So as I'm running up to the carpet, I see Percy go and I'm like, "(growls) Damn Tiamat-lover!" So I bring over the Horn and right at the tip, on the carpet, I let it go. "You deal with it then!"
Matt: Percy? (loud clatter)
Laura: Oh no, K'Varn!
Matt: That's what you get!
Orion: I don't give it to Percy, I let it land on the carpet.
Matt: I know. I'm saying it's on his carpet right now, staring at him from the side.
Ashley: Put it on, Percy!
Orion: I see the-- oh god. Okay, I can only do this once. I see the-- they're not inside yet, right?
Matt: No. They're just starting to get to the doorway. You can see them right there.
Orion: Awesome. Okay, that is a-- and this is a-- Okay.
Matt: What you got, Tiberius? (laughter)
Travis: (Tiberius voice) Poppycock, poppycock.
Orion: Right. I have-- I blow everything. I'm going to blow everything.
Travis: Yes! Blow everybody. (laughter)
Matt: How diplomatic of you!
Sam: I'm stunned!
Orion: You cannot resist!
Matt: So, Tiberius.
Orion: As I leave the Horn there, I turn to where the door is. Obelisk of Stone. I seal up the entryway.
Matt: How many with that, what level are you using it?
Orion: Well, how wide is it? Like 15 feet?
Matt: It's a little over five feet wide.
Orion: Great. I only need one, right?
Matt: Technically, yeah.
Orion: Okay. So I seal that one-- I'm going to use all three right now.
Marisha: Seal the other one, too. I only partially sealed it.
Orion: I'll seal the other one.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: And I'll use the other one on myself.
Matt: Okay!
Orion: And I'm going to use-- I only have three left. Yeah, okay. And I'm going to use my last three sorcerer points that I have, and I have zero points after this, and I'm going to cast Blur on myself. And that's my turn.
Matt: All righty. You now start hearing (boof, boof) slamming sounds from the other side of the stone walls. Both sides of the walls are now sealed off with pillars, and a large pile of rubble on that side. All right, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, before I go anywhere, I'm taking a shot at Clarota.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Betraying bastard.
Taliesin: With Sharpshooter, that's 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 19 points?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That hits, and let's do my damage. That's 22 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. So, Scanlan, as you're stunned, you feel the tentacles swirling around the back of your head. Teeth are grinding into the back of your skull, and you feel this horrible pain as all of a sudden, Clarota's mouth is beginning to find a way towards your skull. (laughter)
Matt: And then the tentacles suddenly go limp as the back of Clarota's head (gunshot) becomes a mess.
Taliesin: Traitor!
Marisha: Traitor!
Laura: I can't believe we killed Clarota!
Taliesin: Some people have no sense of fucking honor! (laughter)
Marisha: Traitor!
Travis: Oh, Percy!
Matt: In a split second, your longtime ally, now turncoat, is scattered across the stone floor. You're released, you're no longer stunned.
Sam: (gasps) Hi, guys!
Taliesin: I still have another shot.
Matt: You do.
Marisha: There's someone on Pike, right?
Matt: There's still one on Pike right now, yeah, right here.
Taliesin: I'm taking a shot there.
Travis: Come on, Perce!
Ashley: Perce!
Marisha: Pew pew!
Taliesin: Oh yeah! So that's 17-- 17, 18, 19--
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Okay, that just hits, all right. I'm trying to use Sharpshooter, so it changes everything. And that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And did we get a short rest before this fight happened?
Sam: No.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Fuck, never mind.
Matt: No you did not.
Marisha: That's why we're all burnt out on spells.
Taliesin: That's why we're all burnt out on shit, okay.
Orion: Except me.
Matt: Yeah, the other one--
Taliesin: I'm going to go up further.
Matt: Even further? Okay.
Laura: "Because I didn't help you guys!" Thanks, Tiberius!
Ashley: "I abandoned my troop!"
Orion: It's going to come in handy now!
Taliesin: Am I high enough yet for her to jump down onto the--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably pull it off.
Taliesin: So, if you and your bear want to jump on?
Matt: It'd be an acrobatics roll, but yeah.
Sam: Wait, why would you-- you've got to come save us!
Laura: Yeah, no, go down and save them, honestly, because I'm staying up top for right now, unless we can teleport out.
Taliesin: Oh, in that case, instead of going up I'm going to go fly to the right, then.
Orion: Pick up Vax!
Laura: Why?
Orion: I said Vax.
Laura: Vax?
Marisha: Vax? Pick up Vax?
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I'm going to fly down towards Vax, as well.
Matt: Okay. So you're going down to here instead?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, you can get about-- we'll say, if you're just going--
Taliesin: Yeah, go there.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Hi.
Ashley: Hey you guys!
Taliesin: Hey you guys!
Marisha: Hey you guys!
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. That brings it--
Ashley: Did anything happen to the guy that had me--
Matt: He just took damage, but he's not done yet.
Ashley: He just took damage, he's still (slurps).
Matt: So, Pike, it's your turn.
Ashley: It's my turn.
Matt: Go ahead and roll to get rid of the Mind Blast stun.
Ashley: Come on.
Sam: Come on, Pikey.
Ashley: Fuck. It's seven.
Matt: Seven? Nope. You're still locked in place.
Taliesin: Can you heal yourself?
Matt: She cannot move. Her entire brain is locked in with a searing clenching pain, psychic energy is just clutching her brain and holding it hostage.
Sam: Still beautiful, though. (laughter)
Matt: You feel, once again, the teeth beginning to pierce the back of the flesh. You feel the teeth of the mind flayer beginning to scrape against the skull, the actual bone it's found in the back. Vax, you're up.
Liam: What did Clarota do with his hat?
Matt: Oh, it's somewhere on the ground over here.
Liam: Over behind--
Matt: Over behind this.
Liam: Okay, I'm still Hasted, I'm going to run down the center over Clar-- I'm going to step on Clarota's-- I don't know if he has nuts, but whatever's there, I'm going to step there, run around Scanlan, and place his fucking hat on my head.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And then run up behind that third mind flayer, who I don't think has taken a hit yet, and just start stabbing him in the back.
Matt: Right here?
Laura: No, on Pike!
Liam: I can't get back there.
Laura: You can't?
Liam: I don't think so.
Laura: Would he be able to make it?
Liam: Well it's up to-- oh dear.
Matt: You can't, with the speed you're running there, because your Hasted speed is doubled, so it's 60 feet.
Liam: I'm Hasted, I can run 12 spaces, so if you think that I could have run around the mind flayer, put on the party hat--
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12. You can move right there.
Liam: Okay, great. So I'm going to start stabbing him in the back, angrily.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Okay, yeah, so, first one is a 15?
Matt: Unfortunately-- no, that does just hit.
Liam: That's a Sneak Attack, because she's next to him. There's nothing in the rule book about stunned, or unconscious, or anything.
Matt: How Sneak Attack works is if they're next to someone that's aggressive toward them; they feel like they have people on two fronts, which is why you get the benefit.
Taliesin: He is, to be fair, very occupied.
Matt: I will say, circumstantially though, because he is currently grappled on to Pike, and is in the process of trying to grind into her brain with his mouth, he is a little preoccupied at the moment.
Travis: He's sucking head.
Matt: So I'm going to go ahead and make a perception roll versus your fast movement. Go ahead and make a stealth-- roll stealth to see whether or not he takes notice and changes his position in defense.
Liam: I rolled a 24.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead. The first attack you rolled was a 15, that hits!
Liam: Okay, thank you.
Matt: And that is a Sneak Attack, he did not see you coming that quickly.
Liam: All right, so that is four, plus seven is 11, plus-- okay, that's 17, 21, thank you. 26, 30, 33. 33 with keen dagger.
Matt: 33 with the keen dagger?
Liam: And I'm sticking that in the back of his neck.
Matt: Okay. That was your first attack?
Liam: That's the first attack.
Matt: Okay, so the first dagger (shnk) sinks into the back of the neck. You just manage to miss all the seriously vital stuff, but you carve a giant section out of the side of its head. The rest of its leathery black outfit's now slick with its own blood. You see it angrily growls, almost this weird guttural, this (gurgling growl) sound as it still remains taut and clenched on Pike, its eyes glaring at you, basically telling you, "Look what I'm about to do to your friend."
Liam: Okay, so good thing I have more knives. So I take the other one, flip it in my hand and then stick it into the neck afterwards. That's a 24.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Yeah, it does. That's eight. Fire damage, I don't know if he takes any fire damage, and I'm going to then stick him with my poison dagger, which isn't going to poison him. But that is a 26 which hits as well.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: And that is eight.
Matt: Eight points of damage. So the first one you stab in the side of the head, you pull back and toss it in the air, catch the second one. As it bursts into flames you place the searing dagger down into the center of its back between its shoulder blades. Its back tenses, and as it does it reaches back and tries to grab for the dagger as you pull back the third one. As it looks back at you it brings up one arm to stop you as it goes in to directly go after Pike's head. The third dagger you then stab it right in the front of the skull. Its eyes roll back in its head and its tentacles limply drag off. (cheering)
Liam: As a bonus action, I would like to Goodfellas-kick him about eight times in the ribs. (laughter)
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: I'll allow it. Oh my god. Because that guy was next! If we didn't kill him this turn, she would've taken 55 points of damage.
Travis: 50-- Let's not even say the number.
Ashley: You saved my life.
Matt: Yeah. And if it takes you to zero hit points, they extract the brain and eat it.
Laura: Now we've got to squish those little brains.
Liam: There's still a mind flayer.
Travis: We're coming real close.
Matt: Let's see if they get their Mind Blast back. Nope. Nope.
Liam: This show is not good for my blood pressure.
Marisha: I know! It's like constant fight or flight.
Travis: I think I'm going blind in my left eye.
Marisha: This should fix your sleep schedule though, right?
Travis: Yeah, totally.
Matt: Seeing both of them get immediately slaughtered, both of these illithids just Plane Shift. A defensive standpoint, self-preservation is kicking in. However, intellect devourers do not have self-preservation. They're there for a specific reason. So this one here is going to move over to this side and is going to attempt to make a Devour Intellect attack against Keyleth. Keyleth, go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Marisha: I'm an elemental, so.
Matt: You keep your intelligence score as you.
Marisha: Oh, I do?
Matt: The physical attributes you get from the elemental form. You keep your intellect, wisdom, and charisma.
Marisha: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18, Okay. You resist the blast of mental impact from the intellect devourer, now on the ground with its four feral legs, its brain form rippling. The second one is going to turn over here and saw the two shots, the one that took out Clarota. It turns up towards Percy, as you've lowered on the magic carpet, Percy. Go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Eight? All righty.
Sam: Oh boy. That ain't no good.
Matt: You take 11 points of psychic damage.
Taliesin: There's an "and" there, isn't there?
Sam: And it's undone immediately. (laughter)
Matt: And you take eight points of intellect damage.
Laura: Oh, this is what happened to Grog!
Travis: You're better off than six, right?
Taliesin: Eight points of intellect damage. What does that mean, precisely?
Liam: Minus from your intelligence.
Sam: You would know if you had more intellect.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: No, no, no, no. For this, it basically-- what's your intelligence?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Yeah, the blast hits you and you just shrug off the impact. It has to exceed your intelligence.
Taliesin: So do I still take eight more points of damage, though?
Matt: No, no no. You just the additional--
Taliesin: I just, I'm just going to go duh-duh. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, the intellect damage is not permanent.
Taliesin: I like purple.
Matt: Not quite that bad.
Travis: I can't not do it.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn. That brings us to Scanlan. You're no longer stunned. You now have full capacity of yourself and you're looking around, oh shit.
Sam: Do we get out of here or do we try to kill these things?
Travis: Can you get us out of here?
Sam: I can get some of us out of here.
Marisha: Start getting us out.
Sam: Are we getting out or are we fighting?
Travis: Getting us out.
Marisha: Because we still have these fuckers we have to--
Ashley: Because Tiberius can get some of us out, right?
Liam: It's just the brains. Just the little brains.
Sam: It's just the little brains. For now.
Matt: Make a perception check, by the way.
Marisha: For now, but people can beat through those doors. That's not a permanent thing.
Taliesin: We need 60 seconds to get out of here is what we need. We need 60 uninterrupted seconds.
Marisha: Well, we can start gathering our shit and packing up.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Marisha: We can start packing up.
Sam: Am I leaving or am I staying?
Travis: You do what you want.
Liam: Do what you want. It's chaos.
Sam: (sighs) All right. Then I'll attack.
Matt: Swarming thing that drift up the sides of the temple from the floor. Coming from inside the temple and out toward the top.
Laura: We should probably get out of here! They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We can't get you out of here if you don't come--
Sam: I run up to Pike. I grab her hand. I say, "I want to have babies with you." (laughter)
Sam: Let's get out of here. (sings) So now I come to you with Dimension Door.
Ashley: Wait! Can I do a Mass Cure Wounds before we leave? (laughter)
Sam: And we get out.
Matt: You're still stunned from the Mind Blast. You haven't made your save.
Sam: We're going up to the top of the-- to the thing. Just to the roof there.
Laura: They're coming up the sides!
Ashley: We've got to go somewhere else.
Sam: Well, I didn't know that. (laughs) It's done.
Orion: It's fine. It's good that they're up there.
Sam: And, as a bonus, I'm going to send some inspiration to Grog.
Matt: Okay, as you Dimension Door you just go ahead and look back. Using the song of love you gave to Pike, you give back, give a wink to Grog. Grog, you take a 1d10 inspiration. 1d10 inspiration dice to you.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Grog, we would like you to rage.
Travis: I'm already there. I'm just being fucking grappled. Is it my turn?
Matt: It is now.
Travis: Oh, can I try it for the third time to break free?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and go ahead and make your athletics.
Liam: Use that inspiration die, man.
Travis: I'll use the inspiration die just in case I rolled balls again.
Matt: Well, you can use it after you do it. See what you roll and then add it.
Travis: It's athletics, right?
Matt: Athletics, yeah.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18?
Liam: Come on.
Matt: Yeah, you (boosh) break out of the creature's grasp. Suddenly it's reaching at you from behind the bars. You can see there's this slick, brackish oil on your body from where it was holding you. Fleshless arms clutching you to the bars.
Travis: So is everybody leaving? Should I climb up the rope?
Matt: There is Lady Kima who is turned to stone.
Marisha: We've got to get Kima out.
Travis: Fuck Lady Kima!
Orion: Pick her up!
Laura: I thought you had a crush on her?
Ashley: Can he grab her and climb?
Matt: You can. She's not a big stone structure.
Travis: Okay, cool. I pick her up and start trying to climb up the rope.
Matt: Okay, so you rush, you grab the stone form.
Sam: Put her in the Bag of Holding!
All - sam - matt: No!
Travis: She's stone! It doesn't matter!
Orion: Don't do that!
Travis: I take her and-- oh, fine. I'll hold on to her.
Sam: No, put her in the bag!
Marisha: Can you make one of those baby slings? Stuff her in your belt?
Taliesin: It's not time for arts and crafts.
Matt: You run up. You grab Lady Kima. You grab her in your arms and you rush. The rope is currently dangling from this side where you guys first came in.
Laura: Stomp all over the brain to get to it.
Matt: 50 speed. You can get up to here. You can just get up to the rope and we'll say as your dash action you can begin to climb, if you'd like.
Travis: I would like to climb.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I would like to raise.
Travis: I would like to rage. Rage climb.
Matt: It gets you about there. Rage climbing like (grunts).
Orion: Yes!
Matt: One-handed up the rope. That's pretty intense. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: Yes. That Crossfit training come in handy.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. Yeah, it's sore. You know that arm is going to be dead tomorrow, but right now it doesn't even matter. You're just clutching Lady Kima, still locked in her attack pose, in one arm as you're overhand grabbing the rope and getting yourself up as fast as you can.
Travis: You better remember this when you wake up. (laughter)
Matt: Rage-climbing up the rope.
Liam: He's climbing the Cliffs of Insanity! (laughter)
Matt: That brings us to Vex.
Laura: I should just stay where I am, right guys?
Taliesin: And you should shoot things.
Laura: I'm going to do that, yes. Is there any other-- there's just a little brain in there right now?
Matt: Right now there's two brains, and you can see just in the outskirts of the temple's side here, two more illithid that are making their way up the side of the temple.
Laura: Oh, fuck me.
Matt: With about a hundred or so just now gathering towards the bottom of the temple base.
Laura: Jesus. We're going to get out of here real fast! You guys are listening to me, right? Because things are coming up the side and we need to get out of here.
Sam: But what if there's gold down there to find?
Laura: I don't give a fuck! I'm going to Hunter's Mark a little brain. Or should I keep attacking the Elder Brain? What do you guys think?
Taliesin: Elder Brain is spilling out the side now, isn't it?
Matt: The Elder Brain is still inside, just the stonework on the outside of it is currently knocked out.
Taliesin: Yeah, I have a carpet anyway, so let's just jump on it.
Liam: I mean, it might get sent reeling, that brain.
Laura: I know, that's why I'm kind of like, hm.
Liam: Maybe if-- we should try to get out of here, but maybe if we can frigging hurt that brain it'll stun them or send them reeling or something, or make them mad.
Laura: All right. I can do Hail of Thorns on it again, so I'll Hunter's Mark it and then I'll do Hail of Thorns on it.
Matt: All right.
Laura: 27.
Matt: That'll hit. Releasing again, in midair you can see all the thorns appear out the sides of the arrow shaft. It explodes into a giant conical-- just a ray, almost like a blizzard of thorns.
Liam: Get it.
Laura: I don't add-- do I add Hunter's Mark to that damage, or just my regular and then that?
Matt: At the end of all the damage you dealt with the attack, you then add Hunter's Mark to that.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: Big money.
Laura: 22. 24.
Matt: 24, all righty. Keyleth, go ahead and make a reflex saving throw.
Marisha: What's happening?
Laura: Oh, right, because you're right next to it, sorry Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, it's okay. My reflex-- I use my dex modifier for my elemental, correct?
Matt: Or deflect, yeah, sorry, old carryover, it's dexterity.
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten? Versus your spell save of--
Laura: 14.
Matt: Yeah, so you take the same damage. You take 24 points of damage.
Laura: Sorry. Oh right, you're really, really strong.
Marisha: Yeah, I've got 100 hit points still.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: So how many points? 21?
Matt: 24. So, all the thorns explode against your rocky physical form; you just shrug it off, like it's nothing. (laughs) It tickles a little.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Laura: So I'll try to-- I guess I'll just attack it again, because I've got nowhere else to go.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: 17?
Matt: All right, 17-- actually no, 17 will miss.
Laura: Oh really, with it oozing out and everything?
Matt: The second, there's some sort of psychic protective field in the brain. As you fire down, the arrow looks like it should strike and then it just arcs off to the side nonsensically, and then just splinters against the stonework next to the--
Laura: Fudge!
Travis: Fudge.
Matt: You going to stay where you are? You going to move?
Orion: Get on Trinket!
Laura: I'm going to climb onto Trinket for some reason, because that makes sense.
Matt: Okay, you climb onto Trinket's back. That brings us to Keyleth. You're up.
Marisha: Okay, what's the situation with the brain soup?
Matt: The liquid is poured out.
Marisha: And how are the brains? Are just brains just floating downstream?
Matt: No, it's actually all-- at a long distance, it looks like one giant brain, close up it looks like all of these smaller brains have all congealed into one giant mind.
Laura: It's like a jello mold of brains.
Marisha: Like a jello mold of a brain. And there's fluid coming out from underneath of it?
Matt: Yeah. Literally the fluid it was sitting in, it was mostly submerged in, is all now poured out onto the ground near you, beginning to get slick.
Marisha: Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be like, phase under, phase down, and I'm going to get under where the brain would be, and I'm going to Superman punch it!
Laura: Yes!
Orion: Yeah!
Marisha: From underneath.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an attack roll.
Travis: Come on, punch it in its big brain anus.
Marisha: 23!
Matt: 23, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: (laughs) 11? Wait, is that my--
Taliesin: No, 22.
Marisha: Oh, 22! You're right, 22.
Matt: It's not double damage, because you're not hitting the structure. So 11 points of damage? All right, now I want you to go ahead and make a strength check.
Marisha: Okay, that sounds fun.
Matt: So just roll and add your strength modifier of the earth elemental.
Marisha: 14?
Matt: Okay, as you punch upward, you're still partially absorbed into the earth, but your fist comes through and it slams in, and you feel this sickening thud sound as your fist hits the interior of the brain. It still moves a little bit but it stays in its place held aloft by its own psychic defense mechanism. Make your second attack.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, same, 21.
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage on that one.
Laura: Big damage!
Marisha: Come on.
Taliesin: Big money.
Marisha: Oh, that's better. 16.
Matt: 16 damage. Go ahead and roll another strength check.
Marisha: Eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay. Once again, you slam your fist into it and you feel like the impact is absorbed partially by the psychic field around the brain. It holds itself in place. It's still not moving from within that small--
Marisha: Do I stay or do I get out?
Laura: Get out.
Orion: Get out.
Matt: You still have about-- I'd say it only took you about 15 feet of movement to get underneath it.
Marisha: In my burrowing speed, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: So, I'm going to start burrowing up the side of the mountain-- up the side of the temple, so I can pop out next to them.
Matt: Okay, so we'll say 25, 30, 35, 40, 45. What's your total burrow speed?
Marisha: 60.
Matt: So you'll be about there.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: So you're about as high as Tiberius is, partially up the wall.
Marisha: I'm in the wall.
Laura: They won't see you.
Travis: Vax, you're still on the floor, right?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Up on there. As you glance in, you kinda have a brief look at the outside of the wall and on the opposite side there are two other mind flayers. One more coming up on the side and another troll behind it. And the troll's slamming onto the bricks you left up. And these two illithids are starting to look up and see you moving up, and their eyes go up and they can see the opening in the top of the-- where the wall collapsed earlier. And they both look up and kinda start drifting up towards it. So that ends your turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: What's the order after me?
Matt: Well, it's Percy, Pike, Vax, and then they go. Then Scanlan, Grog.
Taliesin: I was going to hold my turn to get everybody on the carpet.
Liam: I'm coming.
Orion: Okay, okay, good. I cast Fly at 5th level. I cast it on myself. I cast it on Grog. And I cast it on-- you're not there.
Laura: Trinket!
Orion: Trinket. (groans)
Travis: She's on Trinket.
Laura: So I can fly if I'm on Trinket, right?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Sweet!
Matt: All right, so Grog, Trinket, and--
Orion: Me.
Matt: Yourself. Okay.
Orion: And I (flying noise).
Matt: What's the fly speed on that?
Orion: Um, outside?
Liam: A skillion.
Orion: I dunno, it's right here. It's right here.
Matt: It's on the card, the cards I gave you.
Orion: The cards! Look at the cards. It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet. You make your way up top and you're now hovering. Trinket's now having another Peter Pan moment with you on his back awkwardly. It's just gotten used to flying on its own, that one time it had. Now it has an extra weight on its back. (bear noises)
Laura: You can do it, buddy. You can do it.
Ashley: You got it, Trink.
Matt: All right.
Orion: Oh wait, hold on-- I want to turn to to everybody and go, "Fly, you fools."
Matt: It's a free action, I'll let you do that. (laughs) Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: You're holding back?
Taliesin: I'm holding my turn.
Matt: Okay. Percy, holding back. Pike, go ahead and make an intellect saving throw.
Laura: Yes!
Ashley: 19.
Matt: 19. You finally shrug off the effect of the Mind Blast. Your eyes clarify.
Sam: Does she fall in love with the first thing she sees? (laughter)
Matt: (laughs) The first thing you do see is Scanlan holding you. You're now outside of the temple. There's the dark, kind of dull glowing green atmosphere outside the entire Yug'Voril city around you, with bits of blue crystal, you know, against the cavern walls. It's scary. You look around you, you can see illithid charging up the side of the temple, just gliding toward you angrily. You look forward and on your shoulders, clutching you, is Scanlan, blood streaking down the front of his face with a big smile.
Ashley: (gasps) Scanlan, are you hurt?
Sam: I'm fine, baby. How are you?
Ashley: I'm great. Well, not really, but I'm just going to pretend I'm happy so that everybody can be okay. (laughter)
Orion: That's right, Pike. Bury it deep inside.
Ashley: Well, can I do a spell? Okay, Mass Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: For the, well, hold on a minute. How low is everybody? Not really that low?
Laura: Nobody's really low.
Travis: I'm at 32.
Ashley: He's pretty low.
Taliesin: You two are the only ones.
Laura: Yeah. Can you cast something on Kima? Oh, no. We should just keep her stone for now.
Sam: You're low. You're super low.
Laura: Yeah, cast it on yourself, man.
Travis: Heal yourself.
Taliesin: She can hold this part of her turn until everybody's up there.
Matt: Mass Cure Wounds on yourself? Because Mass Cure Wounds is for multiple people.
Ashley: No, can I just do--
Matt: You can cast Cure Wounds on yourself.
Ashley: I can?
Matt: Yeah.
Ashley: But he needs it, too.
Matt: It's your choice. It's also touch. You have to be next to him to do that.
Ashley: Shit.
Travis: Just do your thing. You need it.
Ashley: All right, I need it? Oh no.
Matt: At six hit points, I'd recommend it to you.
Travis: The DM recommends it. (laughter)
Matt: You were so close to dying again. I was so scared.
Travis: I stringently urge you.
Liam: Four out of five DMs recommend. (laughter)
Ashley: All right, 17.
Matt: Okay, so you heal yourself 17 hit points. You clutch your holy symbol. You feel the warmth fill your body and your wounds seal up slowly. You feel a little better, because you were on death's door there. All right. You want to move at all? Anything else you want to do this turn or are you good?
Ashley: Now I'm at 23. Wait, so bonus action?
Orion: Get on the bear!
Laura: No, he can't--
Matt: You don't have to.
Ashley: He can "bear-ly" hold one. (groans and laughter)
Laura: Ba dum tss.
Ashley: I can't do that, right?
Matt: What?
Ashley: I can't get on Trinket?
Matt: Right now, Trinket can barely hold Vex.
Ashley: So as a bonus action, I'll give Scanlan a kiss on his cheek.
Sam: Oh! Do I get an inspiration for that?
Matt: You do. (laughter)
Matt: A d6 inspiration dice.
Sam: I'm never going to wash it again.
Orion: You never wash it to begin with.
Matt: It's this strangely romantic moment as she reaches forward, grabs him and kisses him on the cheek and pulls away and he looks at her with this beautiful smile, and then the sound effects kick in again, of the bats screeching ahead and the (inhales) of all the illithid swarming up the side of the temple.
Marisha: Oh god, we're still in a war zone!
Ashley: Oh no, we got to get it together.
Matt: All right, Vax.
Liam: Okay, I run up the dais, land on the brain. I'm on my way, but before I go, I'm going to kiss you goodbye. Dagger, dagger, dagger. Stabbing into the brain before I leap onto the carpet. So here I go. First one-- misses. Second one is a 25.
Matt: 25, okay.
Liam: Which gets nine damage.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And last dagger is a 13.
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay, so I'll give him a little cut, a little nick, and then jump on the flying carpet.
Matt: Jump on the flying carpet. All righty.
Liam: And I grab Percy around the neck and kiss him on the cheek, and say, "Let's get out of here, you bastard."
Taliesin: Do I get an inspiration point for that? (laughter)
Matt: No.
Laura: That's a double standard.
Taliesin: You know how I feel about you.
Liam: Fight the patriarchy.
Matt: Down the road, maybe. This is the start of something beautiful.
Taliesin: I'm feeling something new.
Matt: Let the seeds germinate for a while. Then the dice may come naturally. So you're holding your turn? Percy, you want to go now?
Taliesin: I want to go now.
Matt: All right. So, that brings you here. Percy, go ahead.
Taliesin: I'm just going to reel straight up. And on my way up, I'm going to take two more shots at the brain.
Matt: Okay, okay. We'll say here for the purposes of this. Taking two more shots?
Taliesin: 16.
Liam: Oh, I'm suffocating in the brain!
Matt: Oh no, it's fallen over. What's the first roll?
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does hit. Oh, it's not even flat, okay. We're just going to put it down there.
Taliesin: And 19.
Matt: 16 doesn't hit. The 19 just barely hits it. It pierces through the psychic barrier. (zoomf) The bullet sinking again into the fleshy membrane.
Taliesin: The second one has a bonus die, yay.
Matt: Ice shot.
Taliesin: Ice shot.
Marisha: Maybe you'll freeze it.
Liam: Percy and Vax, ship it!
Taliesin: That's 13 points plus two points of ice damage.
Matt: Okay, so 16 total. All right. As it blasts inside, you can see the ice, these strange crystals of frozen liquid, they burst out, almost like it actually freezes the blue explosion in place for a moment, and then the ice just slowly melts away. Yeah, there's some damage dealt to it, but this is a hardy sack of hit points. And it's coming online. So with the end of your turn, the brain, now taken a bunch of hits, begins to pulse with energy, now that it's been freed from its control and it's slowly brought itself out of this trance-like slumber that it was placed in by K'Varn. The Elder Brain is now becoming conscious once again.
Liam: Oh dear.
Taliesin: Can we go up there? Can you put us at our height now? (laughter)
Marisha: Can you represent us accurately?
Matt: So at a 30-foot radius, which you guys are, it gives off a pulse of energy, (boomf) this giant psychic burst of purple-ish, psychic blast just cascades out of the center and just fills the room for a second with this large dull thud-like "thoom" sound. All of you instinctively look down and see this explosion that just dissipates as it crests the bottom of the magic carpet, which is just out of range.
Taliesin: You're wearing the helmet, at least.
Matt: At which point, you guys who are at the top, looking off to the side, all the illithid that are rushing up the tunnel, there's a sudden flash of purple energy in their eyes simultaneously. Like now the Elder Brain has come back online and has reconnected with its people.
Laura: Out, out, out!
Matt: All right, that brings us to Grog. Grog.
Travis: I can keep flying up?
Matt: All of the sudden, the rope is really easy to go up. It's nothing, you're just going hand over hand.
Orion: You can fly, Grog!
Travis: I have one more level three, whatever it's called, level three healing potion. They're called called superior or something? What's the word for it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I'd like to take that.
Marisha: I have so much adrenaline during these kind of fights.
Taliesin: I know.
Matt: They're moving around, they're angry, they can't quite get to their targets.
Travis: I heal 24 points of hit damage.
Matt: Fantastic. Rolling for the bottom of the attack round. Okay. The troll bursts through the door, filling in with the two mind flayers behind it. They both look up, frustrated. And both begin to drift up.
Laura: No!
Matt: As far as they can get.
Travis: Fuck this house of horrors.
Ashley: How do we get out of here?
Laura: How are we going to get out of here?
Matt: They are going to attempt two Mind Blasts. All right. That's as high as they get with levitation. With the full height that takes the top, because technically you guys are up here, I just couldn't put the structure that high up. The only people-- The only person that's in the radius would be Scanlan and Pike. Again.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: Both of you guys make intellect saving throws again.
Sam: I'm just looking into her eyes the whole time.
Ashley: Can you sing?
Marisha: You've got that inspiration die.
Sam: Oh, I do. I don't need it though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Sam: I'm at 20.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14? All right.
Sam: Can I sing for her?
Matt: (laughs) Unfortunately, you have to do that on your turn. You manage to resist the effects of it. You take 22 points of psychic damage and once again your brain clenches--
Laura: Good thing you healed yourself, Pike!
Matt: Damn good thing you healed yourself.
Sam: She was at 23! That's 22. That's one point!
Laura: Yeah. That's the second time this round.
Matt: You feel all of the sudden, the blast hits you and you see her eyes roll back in her head as she reaches up and grabs the side of her head again, nearly dropping her shield and mace, which you manage to catch before they clatter down into the temple.
Ashley: Okay.
Sam: Baby, come on.
Ashley: Maybe we'll be okay?
Marisha: Do you want some more dice?
Matt: All right, Grog, you're up. Oh no, you're up there, they went. That brings it to the top of the round. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: Take it, take it. Give it to her, please.
Orion: Head to the beach!
Sam: Wait, top of the round?
Matt: Yeah, we're at the very top now. At the very end, the new guys burst in and attacked.
Laura: I'm going to-- (sighs) Is that brain fluid still floating around it? Like, out and stuff?
Travis: Well, we woke it up.
Laura: I know.
Liam: But now it's awake, so--
Matt: Percy shot-- No, actually, you didn't do your turn on that one. I'm sorry, I think we skipped Scanlan.
Sam: Should I kill the brain, or try to kill the brain?
Liam: If you can also flee at the same time.
Orion: Well, he has to wait for the carpet.
Sam: The brain is down there in the puddle? In the pool? Is that big scaffolding still hanging over it?
Matt: It's currently dangling over to this side. Because it's been busted from three different corners and it's precariously hanging.
Sam: But it's not right over the thing?
Laura: But it might fall and tip.
Sam: Or it could not.
Ashley: Could somebody also use Telekinesis to pull it to fall the other way?
Orion: I do not have the necessary item to do two concentration spells at once.
Sam: Is it super heavy?
Matt: It's pretty heavy. It probably weighs close to 700 to 1,000 pounds.
Marisha: What does?
Matt: The giant brass structure.
Sam: And how high above it is it? Like, would it get a significant amount of force?
Matt: It would fall down and then topple over.
Sam: Unless I made it fall--
Matt: Unless you made it fall. In that case, we'll see.
Sam: Do I do that or do I just Lightning Strike? Okay.
Liam: It's your decision.
Marisha: Go bold!
Travis: Do what you were going to do. Do it.
Sam: I'm feeling handsy. (laughter)
Sam: (sings) Bigby's Hand! So I take Bigby's Hand and I sort of try to wrench it off the last thing that's holding it up, but in the direction of the--
Matt: Okay!
Sam: Of the brain.
Matt: Go ahead and make a roll, adding your plus five for your casting ability.
Sam: Well, that's not good.
Orion: And inspiration!
Sam: Oh, yeah! Okay, so that makes it 13 plus what?
Matt: 13 plus five, which is your charisma.
Sam: Okay, then 18.
Matt: 18. As the spectral Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs the top of the structure, you can see the weird bit of bent metal that was once part of the mostly-destroyed structure that held it aloft in the center of the temple (metal creaking) wrenches forth and snaps as the entire structure begins to be pulled at an angle.
Sam: (sings) It's Bigby's Hand.
Matt: It slams down at an angle into the side of the brain and coming to rest on top, crushing even further the corpse of Clarota, currently smeared across the ground. Oh, man. Go ahead and roll 6d6 force damage on that. Crushing damage, as this heavy thing jams itself into the brain.
Liam: Six cubes, Sam, six cubes.
Sam: Orion's my dice bimbo.
Orion: Here you go, boss.
Ashley: There you go, boss!
Sam: 16.
Matt: 16, so the structure slams into the Elder Brain, and you can see like a bit of purplish black liquid kinda squirts out to one side and for the first time you can see a part of the brain is actually torn open, and the purplish glow that you see throbbing in the middle of its folds is now visible from the interior. You can see now, it's taken some real damage. Immediately the two mind flayers that were floating up look down, freaked out, and begin moving towards the brain now, instinctively, to defend it.
Sam: And bonus action, can I pour some superior healing potion down Pike's beautiful throat?
Matt: You can. (laughter)
Matt: I'm not going anywhere with that.
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Sam: I'm just pouring my potion down Pike's throat.
Matt: Anyway. All right, so Vex, what're you doing?
Sam: I don't know what superior is.
Matt: Oh, it's a superior one, superior goes to, it's 8d4 plus eight.
Sam: Do I roll or does she?
Matt: You roll.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: It's your potion.
Sam: 8d4 plus eight.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Holy bajeez. One.
Matt: Five, nine, 13.
Sam: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: 15, 18, 21.
Matt: One more.
Sam: 22.
Matt: Plus eight, 30. You heal 30 hit points.
Ashley: What? Awesome.
Sam: I got some good potion.
Matt: Very, very expensive potion used. All right, so. Vex? You're on Trinket still, do you want to hold your action and wait for the rest of the carpet, do you want to attack anyone, what do you want to do?
Laura: I want to attack the Elder Brain.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: I'm going to-- I think all I can do is a Conjure Barrage.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: So it's the cone of attack.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: So that will get hopefully all the things, because I'm shooting down, right?
Matt: Well, how big is the cone?
Laura: It's 60 feet.
Matt: 60-foot cone from your angle here, if you're going for the brain it'll catch this guy, maybe, as a cone that goes down this way.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Unless you want to go this way and hit these guys, or this guy.
Liam: You could get the edge of the brain.
Laura: Yeah, can I do the edge on the brain and get--
Matt: Yeah. You can get, you can get probably these guys there.
Laura: All right, let's do that.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So they get saving throws, right? How does that work?
Laura: Yes, they get saving throws.
Matt: So roll damage, and we'll see what their saving throws are.
Laura: Okay. But do I have to roll to see if it hits, or it just hits?
Matt: No, for that one, it's just a barrage and they get to roll a saving throw against it.
Laura: Oh! Okay, cool. 17?
Matt: All right.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark? On the Elder Brain.
Matt: Yeah, so the Elder Brain takes additional damage.
Laura: Three additional. Do I get plus two for the bracers on that Conjure Barrage?
Matt: Technically, yes you would, because they're ranged.
Laura: Okay, so that would've been 19.
Matt: 19. All right. Cool. And then this guy fails its save, so total damage on him?
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19 on him? Okay. So it's still alive, just looking really, really rough. The brain's just now pierced with a bunch of arrows, some of it, it's barely holding itself on top of its feet. And the troll also takes the damage as well, just seems to shrug it off, just seems to angrily-- roars up from the bottom of the temple at you, now seemingly helpless in the current circumstance.
Laura: So then I want to attack the Elder Brain again.
Matt: All right. So you release it down.
Laura: 20.
Matt: Very nice, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: All right. 11.
Matt: 11 points of damage, all right.
Laura: Oh, wait, wait! No, lies! 13.
Matt: 13, okay, there we go.
Travis: (laughs) No, lies.
Matt: (laughs) Reach down again, release this one, aiming towards the now torn-open wound on the side of the Elder Brain as the arrow now sinks in, there's another pulse of purple energy, and you hear, all of you simultaneously in your heads this scream, this screech (screech) that echoes through your heads. As it does, the two illithid that were hovering towards it grab their heads momentarily out of frustration and glare up at you angrily.
Orion: Ooh! I took notice of this.
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to take the rest of my burrow speed to get up to the top.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm assuming I'm there?
Matt: You just manage to make it to the top of the temple, yeah.
Marisha: Okay. Drop earth elemental.
Matt: All right. Keyleth is on the field.
Marisha: Would you say--
Sam: Oh boy. (laughter)
Matt: Nothing good ever comes out of this. What do you got, Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Theoretically.
Matt: Theoretically?
Marisha: Our brains are made up of water, right? Would you say that there is water in the like jello brain mold, like water molecules would be in it?
Matt: Make an arcana check.
Marisha: Okay. I don't know much in terms of arcana, but I can try. Ten.
Matt: You have no idea. You have never encountered an Elder Brain before.
Laura: Yeah, give it a try!
Taliesin: Give it a try!
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to cast Control Water. I'm going to assume that there's water, it's 300 feet, I got the range and I'm going to take the brain where it's already kind of sliced down the middle where Vex has already made progress, I'm going to take it and I'm just going to rip it apart.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier to it.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Wait, you're saying brains are made of water?
Taliesin: Whoa!
Marisha: 23.
Matt: Okay. There is an element of liquid to its structure, however it is difficult to extract it from a form that you're unfamiliar with, let alone one that's this stable. You manage to find a way to pull moisture out of parts of it and actually deal damage to it as you're beginning to shrivel sections of the brain. Go ahead and roll 3d6. You do 3d6 points of dehydration damage.
Marisha: I'll take it, I'll take it.
Ashley: Make some brain jerky.
Marisha: They'll have a really bad hangover tomorrow.
Matt: Oh yeah. Oh, you don't even know the half of it.
Marisha: Ooh! Just 3d6 or plus anything?
Matt: Just 3d6.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: 15, all right. 15 points of dehydration damage to the Elder Brain. You can see now the portion of the wound that's been opened, the corners of it kind of shrivel in and tuck in and the actual purple glow in the inside dulls slightly. And you now have, currently, in the air, a small amorphous globule of brain fluid that's just kind of floating there in this, in the air.
Ashley: Awesome.
Laura: Gross.
Marisha: Cool. (laughter)
Marisha: Scanlan, smell it! Smell it!
Sam: No, thank you.
Matt: Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Did you say there was illithid coming up on the sides, too?
Matt: Yeah, they're swarming up the side. They're probably about halfway up.
Orion: Okay. I turn to the group. I suggest we go to the beach immediately. There we can shore up defenses and I can cast a spell and get us out of here. As I say that, I go (fwwt) and throw a Fireball right at that fucker's head.
Matt: Okay. Are you using your movement to bring the carpet, to take control of the carpet from Percy and move it up higher?
Orion: No, I'm up top. I have Fly on myself.
Matt: Oh, that's right. Sorry. Yeah. All right, so.
Orion: Yeah, I just let a Fireball down on the brain.
Matt: Into the brain, all right. All right, so that's enough to get both of these guys. Go ahead and roll damage. And they both failed their save, so full damage.
Travis: Crush the nuts.
Ashley: Little brains.
Matt: I like that, good.
Orion: 40.
Matt: 40?
Laura: Whoa!
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: Those incinerate. And 40 points of damage to the Elder Brain as this giant echoing explosion blasts up from below. All of you at the top, you are underlit momentarily from the flash of red and yellow flame. As you look down, there's now a sizzling sound and this like smell of horrible burnt flesh as part of the Elder Brain now that was originally dehydrated is now also burnt and singed. You can see now, it's looking a little rougher and it's very very unhappy with its current circumstance.
Laura: I want to kill it before we leave now.
Matt: All right. Pike, go ahead and make a saving throw.
Marisha: Come on, Pike!
Laura: Why a saving throw?
Matt: Still trying to get rid of the stun.
Laura: Oh, right.
Matt: So intellect saving throw.
Ashley: 16?
Matt: 16. You shrug off the effect--
Ashley: Yeah! Man. Thanks, Keyleth. Much better now.
Marisha: New dice!
Sam: What? I've been doing it wrong this whole time.
Ashley: Can I do anything, or that's my turn?
Matt: That's your turn.
Orion: My movement, by the way is I head to the beach.
Sam: You're ghosting?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: You just get the fuck out of Dodge, Tiberius is that way.
Ashley: Wait, where do we go? Nobody's taking us?
Laura: No, you've got to hop on the carpet when it comes up.
Ashley: Oh, okay, got it.
Marisha: Classic Tiberius.
Taliesin: All right, here's a question  can everybody still fly?
Matt: Vax?
Orion: As long as I'm thinking about it.
Liam: Well I'm still sitting, still kneeling on the flying carpet with Percy, so I'm just throwing daggers at the bacon brain.
Matt: Okay. They're at disadvantage at this distance.
Liam: Okay. So that means, aw man, 17 on the first.
Matt: 17? (ricochet sound) Reflected, deflected by the arcane shield on the brain.
Liam: All right, so then the second one does as well, and the last one definitely does, so.
Matt: Yeah, so all three just (ping, ping, ping).
Taliesin: Take the wheel!
Matt: As it gets more and more damaged, it's waking up more and more and it looks like it's actually gaining power the more it does.
Liam: Okay, and then Percy yelled in my ear, so I take some of the little carpet tassels.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. So as your movement, you manage to move the carpet all the way up, it swoops up into the center of--
Laura: Grab the gnomes!
Matt: This right here. You guys are all looking precariously at this carpet that is now floating up from the center of the temple. As you get to the top, you look over and you can see there's probably close to 20 mind flayers that are swarming up the side. That brings us to, Vax, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right, I pull out Bad News. And I'm going to lie down on my stomach, hanging off the edge of the carpet.
Sam: Hanging brain!
Taliesin: And I'm taking a shot straight down.
Matt: Okay. I'll say it takes you your--
Taliesin: My movement.
Matt: Movement to get it out. So you're there, you're unable to move the carpet, you pull the Bad News out, you get down, you're precariously off the side of it, and it is sagging as your weight touches it, you get ready, go ahead and fire.
Taliesin: Firing a deadshot.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, come on.
Taliesin: That's 18.
Matt: As you fire, the blast sends you up almost onto your feet on the carpet again, and you hear this impact sound, this (crash) of the blast hitting stone as the psychic field around it deflects the bullet, sending it into the ground.
Laura: I thought 18 was the number that we were aiming for-- shit.
Taliesin: Wait, did I have an inspiration dice from last-- fuck.
Orion: You did.
Taliesin: I did have an inspiration dice from last game! I did! What do you give people with it?
Sam: d10.
Taliesin: d10? Oh fuck, that's right.
Orion: Can he add it now?
Matt: Yeah, I'll trust you on that.
Taliesin: I did! I did, because I'm always excited when I get them, because I never get them.
Matt: That's true, okay, yeah. All right. Go ahead and roll for that.
Taliesin: 21!
Matt: That'll do it.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: As the brain continues to wake up, it improves its defenses, improves its capabilities--
Laura: Oh, I understand.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: But that will hit. So go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Okay.
Orion: It's Hulking?
Matt: Essentially. So as you release the blast, it hits the psychic field, the first impact you hear is it hitting the psychic field and pushing through into the actual brain matter.
Marisha: Come on!
Taliesin: Let me double-check that I'm doing this right, hold on, deadshot's weird. Plus weapon damage. Okay, so that's eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13... 25 points of damage.
Matt: 25 points of damage. Boom! You see the section of it that's kinda charred and burned gets blown off, and now there's a corner of the brain that's just an open and gaping wound. The purplish glow on the inside is pulsing more and more angrily. It's taken a beating, but it's hanging in there.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Marisha: Will not die.
Matt: This is, you guys have left a good mark on it. You get the sensation, with the swarming incoming, you may start to consider self-preservation, because the Elder Brain looks like it's taken some hits, but it's not on death's door yet.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Marisha: Let's get out.
Laura: We need to go.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Scanlan is up?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: We're out of here?
Taliesin: We need everybody to hop on the carpet first.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: You're hopping up?
Sam: No, I'm going to turn into a huge pterodactyl and carry some folks.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What?
Laura: You can do that?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's got Polymorph.
Travis: Yeah, turn into a batwing.
Matt: Cool, so we'll say for the time being, we'll use this as Scanlan.
Sam: Great.
Matt: You are a giant pterodactyl, a creature that you've read in books in the past, you haven't actually seen in person. And what are you doing?
Sam: Who can I carry?
Matt: You can carry one person with your claws. You haven't used this form before, and this is you figuring it out, so pick one and you can take them with you.
Sam: I'm going to take someone heavy.
Liam: Grog.
Matt: Grog can fly.
Laura: I can fly on Trinket, yeah, everybody's covered, man.
Sam: There's only one person I can take.
Matt: As the pterodactyl Scanlan swoops down and both its claws grapple on your arms and lift you off the top of the temple, flying after Tiberius.
Taliesin: How do you make that weird?
Matt: All right, so they're now out of harm's way. Very top of the round, that brings us to Grog. Still carrying Kima under your arm.
Travis: We're getting out, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: So I don't have to worry, so up and out.
Matt: So you just awkwardly fly with Kima under your arm, off with the rest of the group.
Liam: (sings) Sweet bird of prey, fly, fly away.
Sam: (sings) Up, up, and away, I'm a beautiful pterodactyl.
Matt: We'll get these guys off the board here because you do have two Illithid that get up to the edge here. They're going to attempt a Mind Blast.
Liam: We're gone, man, we're gone!
Laura: Not yet.
Matt: Still holding back. So--
Liam: I jump up to get out of range.
Matt: That can just get Trinket and Vex, if you can go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw for both of you.
Liam: Don't fuck with my sister.
Orion: Trinket and Vex are still there?
Laura: Yeah. I know, I didn't get to--
Sam: They never flew.
Laura: I know, I didn't use the movement on the last turn.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: I just didn't say it because I'm an asshole.
Sam: You are.
Liam: What kind of saving throw?
Matt: Intelligence.
Sam: Intelligence.
Laura: Ten? On me.
Matt: Okay. Roll for Trinket.
Liam: You rolled nine, plus two is 11.
Laura: Oh. Okay. 11.
Matt: So go ahead and roll for Trinket.
Laura: Oh! I rolled a nine, plus two, plus two.
Liam: For what?
Laura: For my ring that I'm wearing.
Liam: Okay.
Laura: So whatever that was.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 13.
Liam: 13.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: For me.
Matt: And roll for Trinket.
Laura: Which is going to be a major fail because Trinket is the dumbest. (laughter)
Sam: Don't talk about Trinket like that.
Travis: Is he the dumbest?
Laura: No, that's a minus four. So that would be a nine for Trinket.
Matt: Nine for Trinket.
Laura: Who is, by the way, my only way to get out of here right now.
Matt: So communally, both you and Trinket freeze in place, and Trinket, who is flying, slumps onto the top of the temple, limply laying across the edge, about to tip over off the temple.
Sam: (whispering) Told you we should've left Trinket behind.
Matt: That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: A lot of Sandmen in there.
Marisha: Well first and foremost I'm going to get on the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you leap up here with these guys.
Marisha: Secondly, I am going to-- Okay, wait, Trinket's stunned?
Matt: Trinket is currently catatonic (moans), just barely holding herself right there. You can see she's struggling with the flight spell, like she's kind of levering herself into the ground--
Laura: Trinket's a boy.
Matt: Him, sorry. I was thinking of you.
Laura: If he's about to die, at least get his gender right.
Matt: I apologize, Trinket. I'm sorry.
Marisha: Wait, shove him?
Taliesin: Shove him onto the carpet.
Marisha: No, I can't shove him.
Sam: Wait, he's floating.
Marisha: Okay, can I do this? Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm on the carpet. I'm going to cast Grasping Vine from the carpet and wrap around Trinket and have a Trinket tow vine.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Like the Macy's Day parade!
Matt: So as you leap onto the carpet, you reach down, and the fibrous nature that the carpet was originally made from, you manage to pull the essence of that out to create a vine of similarly patterned color of the actual magic carpet material. The various silks form into this tendril that wraps around both you and Trinket and pulls you guys hanging behind the carpet, so you guys are essentially now towed to the carpet.
Marisha: Let's go!
Orion: Can she take control of the carpet, too?
Marisha: Can I now use the rest of my movement to be like--
Matt: You currently do not have control of the carpet because you used your action and everything to use that spell and your concentration at that point.
Marisha: Okay, I'm just holding.
Matt: You're just holding them there. That brings us to Tiberius, you're off, flying off. Pike is off, Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm steering us the fuck outta here, man.
Matt: You tow Trinket and Vex out behind. As you guys pull off at full speed, the rest of the illithid swarm to the top, you can see about 15 or so get to the front top here, look down at the Elder Brain, look up at the rest of you with this angry look, and as you're pulling away, your eyes adjust to the darkness of the cavern and you look down and you swear you can see hundreds and hundreds of sets of purple glowing eyes just staring up from the city as you all slowly fly away to the far end of the cavern. As you're moving, so are the eyes.
Laura: (sings) We've made some enemies. They're coming after us.
Orion: I want to make a note, because I'm way ahead of everybody at this point, as soon as I land on the beach, I cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Barring that there's nobody there, but I do that immediately.
Matt: All right, so. A few minutes go by, you guys are moving past and over the water channel that's between the north side of the island and the beach where you guys previously set. (laughter)
Matt: As Tiberius, you land on the dirt. You land, immediately begin casting the Circle of Teleportation, you begin scrawling this circle on the ground, running your finger across the gravel surface to build the runes. As your fingers drag across, you can see the arcane light beginning to glow and form the sigils and the runes as you're drawing them feverishly. The rest of the group eventually catches up to you about 30 seconds into it. As you all eventually get back, you and Trinket manage to shrug off the effect. And you find yourselves halfway through being towed by this vine awkwardly.
Laura: What is happening right now?
Marisha: Stupid wrench.
Matt: A few seconds pass, you finish the incantation, you place your hand down on the center of the sigil, this wave of arcane energy blasts off, and suddenly, above this circle, this tearing sound pulls out of the middle of the ether, and this kind of purple shimmering doorway opens above the circle sigil that he crafted on the side of the beach.
Orion: By the blessings of Bahamut, I choose Emon!
Matt: At which point, the doorway that he just created takes some sort of a solid form and from what you can see on the other side, there appears to be some sort of low-lit room.
Liam: Greyskull!
Laura: (gasps) Greyskull!
Orion: I run right through.
Matt: All right. Tiberius runs through. Everyone else?
All: Yes!
Sam: Are we there?
Matt: You guys have all landed on the beach as he finished casting this, yeah.
Laura: Run!
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You all rush through the portal, one after the other, towards the very end is Grog, you bringing up the rear, holding Kima, you go rushing towards it as it begins to slowly close, this only lasts a round, you barrel through just in time as it closes behind you with a sparking sound.
Taliesin: We are time bandits. (cheering)
Travis: Oh, fuck. I just caked my pants.
Taliesin: Squish-squish.
Laura: I hate that phrase.
Orion: That was something, now, wasn't it?
Taliesin: That was fantastic.
Travis: Chocolate cake.
Matt: You all emerge within a small 20-foot-by-20-foot white stone chamber. You all are kinda crammed in this space currently, but you are all apparently safe and sound. As the doorway closes behind you, you turn and look, and on the ground there is a similar circle across the stone flooring, different patterns, different, you know, arrangement to the one that he had drawn, but with some similarities that are kind of a reminiscent glow, almost like a code to this circle, fade away, based on what he had drawn previously.
Laura: They won't be able to open that back up?
Orion: We are safe.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Just a quick request  she is made of stone. Holding Lady Kima.
Ashley: Yes! I'll go over and cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Orion: Hold on just one second.
Travis: Hold on.
Orion: We still have the Horn to deal with.
Taliesin: The Horn is on the carpet. It has been specifically not touched.
Matt: So it's just kind of sitting there. The carpet's bunched to the side now as you guys kind of flew into the portal and kind of left it there and the Horn's just resting there.
Orion: I think we should get it out of her view before--
Taliesin: I think we should put it in the Bag of Holding.
Travis: Sure, yeah. Do you want to teleport it in the bag?
Ashley: If your crushing couldn't kill it, the thousand pounds?
Orion: We can store it there.
Liam: Where are we? You said we're in a room.
Matt: It's a small yellow room, sorry, a small white stone room and there is a kind of yellowish brown stone doorway that is closed. There's some very faint white orbs that are locked into the wall. So you're not in Greyskull Keep now.
Marisha: Oh, we're not in Greyskull.
Matt: You guys don't have a teleportation circle installed in your Keep yet. You don't know where you are.
Sam: We're in a room right now?
Matt: You're in a room, you're in a 20-foot-by-20-foot room, with two small white orbs on the sides that are kinda set into the walls to give off a faint white arcane glow. There's a single doorway that exits the room that is currently closed.
Orion: The way Circle of Teleportation works is when I learned it I get to pick two locations that I know innately. I picked Emon as one of them.
Laura: Oh, okay. Okay.
Marisha: So we're somewhere in Emon.
Orion: But I just had to pick the two.
Marisha: So we could be in someone's living room right now?
Orion: I'll use Telekinesis to lift the Horn off the carpet.
Matt: Okay. You still have the spells?
Orion: Yeah, I can burn one from my Ioun stone.
Laura: Should we wrap it at all?
Taliesin: It'll be fine in the Bag of Holding.
Liam: Not knowing what else to do, Vax is going to go to the door and just inspect it, see if it's trapped.
Matt: Roll a perception check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. All right, the door does appear to be locked. It is not trapped.
Liam: Not trapped. Okay, I'll get to work on it, then. 32.
Matt: Okay, 32. You, relatively easy, the door comes unlocked, the small, it's like a very very intricately carved brass handle that has swirls upon it, like it's almost like a burst of wind being blown and frozen in gold. You turn it and the door opens slightly.
Liam: Pull up, I'm still wearing my tin hat and I pull up my hood from my elven cloak, and I go stealth. And I am stealthed, because that's a 32. And I have a look around outside the door.
Matt: Okay. As you open the doorway, it leads into a secondary chamber. This is an 80-foot-diameter circular chamber now, so you're entering the edge of a giant circle. There are a series of other doors, almost in respective rows next to each other, and you also see, in the center of the room, a vibrant chandelier made of white crystal like the spheres you saw in the previous room you were in, giving off a warm, atmospheric glow to the entire room. In the center of the room, there is a semi-circle desk that is also made of a similar white stone material that the rest of the room is made out of, with polished gold leaf trimming on the edge, and you do see what looks to be an elven man sitting at the desk, longish gray-white hair, he's wearing robes that are finely dressed, and he's half-falling asleep at a desk with a series of books kind of piled up on the side. As soon as the doorway opens, he looks up, and you hear a slight little arcane tinging sound, like a little bell being rung, as you open the door. He looks up for a second.
Laura: Say hello.
Liam: Yes yes yes. I just walk forward and pull down the cloak and say, "Hello."
Matt: "Stay right where you are! Do not move!"
Liam: Hands up in the air.
Matt: "Do not move!"
Liam: Nothing in them. No threat, no danger here. A little lost, apparently.
Matt: "Apparently."
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "Who else is in, who else goes there? Who else, please, step outside! Reveal yourselves!"
Liam: They're--
Laura: Hi!
Marisha: Hi.
Ashley: Hello.
Sam: (pterodactyl screech)
Matt: As soon as he sees you, he goes, (screams).
Orion: I cast Dispel Magic on Scanlan.
Sam: Do you have it anymore?
Orion: Yeah, I do.
Sam: You just did it to me earlier in this round.
Orion: No, Counterspell, and I Silenced you, this is Dispel Magic, which ends your spell.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Sam: Oh. Hello.
Matt: So as you cast the spell and transform, he stops in the middle of casting a spell reflexively and goes, "Oh. And a bear. Interesting."
Orion: He's friendly.
Sam: He's real.
Liam: I have a very long, very strange story, every word of which is true, and if you will give me five minutes, I swear I can convince you--
Matt: He opens a book and starts thumbing through the pages.
Liam: No ill intent. Intent? Yes.
Matt: "We have no expected arrivals at this hour. I need to know your business, your names, and your affiliations immediately."
Marisha: We will totally do that when we know--
Laura: We are affiliated with the king.
Liam: Yeah, emperor. Just tell the emperor that Vox Machina has returned from Kraghammer, and we have news for him, and--
Matt: "Well."
Laura: We were on very secret business for the crown, actually. And that is why you weren't informed of our business.
Orion: Yeah, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. How are you?
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Did you wink?
Orion: I'm responsible for casting the spell to get us here to begin with.
Laura: (laughs) With advantage.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That would be a 20-- no. 35.
Matt: All right. He looks to you, as you guys are saying, he--
Laura: That's not possible. 25.
Matt: 25. (laughter)
Matt: He stands up from the desk and gives you all a look-over and says, "Well, I am Gatekeeper Xanthas, I am the evening keeper of the Traverse Junction here in the-- it's the Traverse Junction."
Orion: Gatekeeper?
Matt: "Here within the Lyceum. The hour is late. We are two hours past midnight."
Taliesin: Well, I am Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III, and, hello, and we would love to report to the emperor of your great hospitality at this unfortunately early hour, and we would look forward to reporting of all of your kindness and good housekeeping.
Liam: I imagine he would be very upset if we were delayed. We come with very grave news.
Taliesin: I would hope not to imagine it.
Matt: "Well. I'm certain the Headmaster would like to know your business in the morning."
Laura: Yes.
Matt: "Headmaster Thurmond. He runs this Alabaster Lyceum within the Erudite Quarter. If you would please submit a report for your reasons for using the Lyceum Junction property by tomorrow, I'm sure that would suffice for the required paperwork."
Laura: Of course we will.
Taliesin: You are too kind.
Laura: In the meantime, we'll just go to our Keep that we have in town.
Orion: Greyskull Keep.
Matt: Gives you a very, a disbelieving look and kinda goes, "Very well."
Taliesin: Good day, good evening.
Sam: I cast Friends on him and I tell him, "You know of our Keep, don't you?"
Matt: Okay. He goes, "I seem to recall hearing about a Vox Machina at some point discussed, but I don't get out very often. Running the graveyard shift here at the Lyceum has taken its toll on my social life."
Laura: You poor thing, you should get out more.
Matt: "Well here, let me show you out." And he walks you through the rest of the hallways. It's a beautiful, beautiful kind of domed center chamber into a long series of white stone hallways, similar material to what the first room you arrived in looked like. Eventually to a main foyer area, which has a very high ceiling and a series of beautifully carved pillars that show different creatures, almost like devas and demons battling each other as they spiral up these pillars, to the front doorways. There are two guards that are adorned in kinda silver and gold armor with these very high, elven in design-shaped helmets, and they step to the side as the doors open on their own.
Laura: Love the hat.
Matt: Guards do not respond to you whatsoever, they just step to the side. Gatekeeper says, "All right, well, here is your way out, have a wonderful evening and do please return for your report on the morrow."
Laura: Of course.
Sam: Oh, one more question before you leave, what district are we in right now?
Matt: "The Erudite Quarter."
Sam: Thank you.
Travis: Gesundheit.
Matt: "Good night." The doors slam (boof) behind you as you guys exit, and you're now--
Laura: Holy shit, we survived! What was that?
Marisha: Oh my god! Keyleth just goes down on her knees and starts kissing the ground.
Taliesin: Well, that could've gone worse.
Marisha: Oh, we're home.
Ashley: I just want to get in my bed so bad.
Marisha: Look! Stars!
Matt: You look up and, for the first time in close to a week, you can see stars, you can see a crescent moon, probably just past its single quarter phase. It is a sight for sore eyes right now.
Ashley: I'm so happy.
Travis: Would you say it's a beautiful sight?
Matt: Currently? The most beautiful night sky you've seen in all of your years.
Travis: I ruin it with a fart. (laughter)
Orion: I'm glad you held that the whole time we were down there, Grog.
Travis: I've had horrible stomach pains this whole time, I'm sorry.
Laura: What, are we just carrying around this stone Kima with us, or are we taking her back to our--
Liam: Yes, but don't stand right in front of her when you undo the stone.
Orion: Actually, hold on a minute, let's all rest before we deal with this one.
Travis: Yes.
Ashley: No, because I want to be able to have an extra 5th-level spell.
Travis: Oh, right.
Laura: But we're in town now, so we're safe.
Ashley: Yeah, let's go to the Keep.
Laura: Yeah, so it'll be fine.
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: It's a long way. We've got to go across the whole town to get there.
Laura: Well, we've got a fucking flying carpet.
Sam: We do have a flying carpet.
Taliesin: The metro's running at this hour.
Liam: We can probably flag down a wagon, too.
Laura: Yeah, we're in town!
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Fuck it. Everything's possible.
Taliesin: Let's go drinking.
Marisha: I was going to say, what bars are open?
Liam: We've got a lot of bling and a cursed Horn. The sky's the limit.
Ashley: I know, should we go to a tavern and get some ale?
Sam: What, who are you?
Travis: Really? You mean it?
Ashley: Well what do you mean, do I mean it?
Travis: It's all empty, can we fill it please?
Ashley: It's all empty?
Marisha: We should get some ale. Wait, maybe we should drop off the Bag of Holding so we're not carrying it around.
Travis: And the stone gnome.
Marisha: And then go out drinking.
Liam: We don't want to lose it in a game of cards.
Marisha: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
Travis: And stone Kima.
Sam: We'll be fine, we've never lost it before. There's eight of us, we'll be fine, let's go drinking.
Ashley: How far is the Keep from here?
Matt: I'd say it's probably a good hour walk.
Marisha: Oh, we've got time.
Taliesin: We could do a pub crawl, we'll just have a beer at every pub we hit on the way back to the Keep.
Marisha: Yes, let's do that! Pub crawl!
All: Pub crawl!
Marisha: We're going to pub crawl back to the Keep.
Liam: Starting here at Geek & Sundry.
Ashley: But should I go just in a bush just behind and--
Sam: Do you have to pee or something?
Ashley: No, and cast Greater Restoration on Kima?
All: No!
Sam: We want to enjoy this.
Orion: She doesn't have a sense of time, she won't know.
Sam: Or humor.
Travis: Let's put her in the bag. She's made of stone!
Laura: We won't tell her how much time has passed.
Taliesin: We'll un-stone her once we're back at the Keep.
Travis: She's stone. Stone doesn't breathe. Right?
Taliesin: It'll be fine.
Sam: We don't know.
Laura: Do not put her in the Bag of Holding! Do not. (laughter)
Liam: For the record, I think she'd be fine, too. But we could bring her around and introduce her; it could be like Weekend at Bernie's. (laughter)
Travis: Ah, yes! I put a fancy robe around Kima's stone statue.
Laura: This is so messed up.
Matt: All right, so as you guys begin making your celebratory pub crawl, starting with the Laughing Lamia Tavern, you buy drinks, laugh, chatter, and kind of take in the lively atmosphere that you would find at 3AM. Which is a little, at this point most of the fun folk are pretty drunk, but at this point you don't care, you'll take your own, and we'll take a quick five-minute break to use the bathroom and we'll pick up from there in just a moment, we'll see you guys here in five minutes to continue.
Travis: We lived!
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Holy shit, guys.
Orion: I was fine. [dramatic music]
Travis: Right, Listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle) (record scratch) Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed great axe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this-- well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die, exiled from his herd. It was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. (chuckle) Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. (thunder) Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! (soft chuckle) Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which, I do. (clears throat) Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays on repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple named Lord and Lady Briarwood came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Ashley: Pike grew up on the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream: a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. (roar, crunch) After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down, Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia. From a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time.
Matt: Welcome back. We got a little refresher here and apparently our Overlord has an announcement.
Zac: You guys, we're only four away from another giveaway, which is--
Lucas: Two away!
Zac: Two away, you know what, I'm guessing this is, we're going to get that before I even get back to my seat, so we're going to go do the giveaway. It's the shirt, the dice, the handbook, and the starter set. The handbook and the shirt will be signed by the cast.
Matt: Yep.
Zac: And we still have, if we get to 400, correct, next? Lucas?
Lucas: Yeah. 3,400.
Matt: 3,400.
Zac: If we get to 3,400 by the end of the night, we'll give away a whole other kit like this, with the signed stuff, so you get to subscribe and it supports the channel, keeps us running. I'm not going to interrupt these guys, so when we hit the number I'm just going to give it away through the chat room.
Matt: Awesome, guys. Well done and congrats to whoever ends up getting that, real fast I hope. So, thank you Overlord.
Taliesin: Oh wait, this is in here. Can I throw this? Oh no.
Matt: Pass it off, it's fine.
Taliesin: You get the horn.
Laura: Can I hold it for a second?
Travis: No.
Orion: No. Oh, I mean in real life. Yeah.
Marisha: No.
Orion: I was like, don't touch it.
Matt: So. Eventually you all manage to make your way towards the outer wall of Emon to the southern portion of the city. The guards let you through. Two of them recognize you from the Winter's Crest celebration that occurred about seven months beforehand. Don't do that, that's going to end poorly. You make your way around the bend to the large grass hill that is surrounded by the river that skirts the outer southern portion of Greyskull Keep. Looking up, you can see against the moonlight the very welcome sight of your home there, beckoning to you to rest. You make your way to the front gates that surround the outskirts of it, and an iron bell kind of goes off for a second, and as you look up, you hear a voice go, "Who goes there? Speak your mind, or a bolt to the throat you'll find."
Marisha: Shayne, is that Shayne?
Orion: Is it dark right now?
Matt: It's dark, yes.
Orion: I cast Light. "It's us!"
Matt: Okay, a light pierces off, and you guys look up and you can see, sitting on kind of the watchtower perch--
Marisha: Or wait, is that Jarett?
Matt: No, you see up there, short, rough red hair, Shayne Tranter, one of the mercenaries you hired--
Marisha: Oh, it is Shayne, I was right the first time!
Matt: She's got her crossbow ready to go, and she's just kind of sitting back and pointing it at the group, and she goes,
Liam: Hello! Hi!
Laura: Hope you remember us!
Marisha: Shayne!
Taliesin: We're drunk!
Sam: We pay you!
Matt: She laughs. Takes her crossbow, sets it to her side.
Ashley: We forgot our key!
Matt: "Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes? It's been nearly a week since you left."
Laura: That's it?
Sam: Feels like a month.
Ashley: Feels like three months.
Taliesin: Feels like eleven weeks. It feels like a very long time.
Matt: "Well, it's probably closer to two weeks. Fair enough. Either way. Open the gates! Cordell, open the gates!"
Sam: Cordell? I don't remember the names of any of our guards.
Matt: Cordell, he's one of the other half-orc guards that you hired when you left.
Marisha: We have Shayne, Cordell, Jarett, Kendrick, and Nitebe.
Laura: Jarett was the one we appointed as the head guard, right? Captain?
Marisha: Jarett? I think so. I didn't write that part down.
Laura: I don't remember about the little fellow.
Sam: Our staff is so unappreciated, guys.
Matt: So as the gate slowly opens, Cordell walking out, this is the hearty half-orc merc dressed in scale armor, and he has a large sword slung on his back, just shoves it open to about a two-foot distance. "Come on. Welcome home." As each of you guys walk through, he kinda claps you on the back as you walk in. You make your way into the small courtyard leading to-- making your way into Greyskull Keep. Towards the front door, as you get there, the front door opens on its own as you're about ten feet away and peering from the inside of the low-lit interior you see a woman's face, a plump blond woman's face, peek through. This is Laina. Laina goes, "Oh, you're back, fantastic! It's early." And she rubs her face and you see as she pushes the door open a little more, she's wearing her nightgown, and she's excited but still very tired. "Come in, come in, come in, please, please! Who's that?" And points to the large stone statue you're dragging behind you.
Laura: Oh, we decided to get a statue for the garden.
Taliesin: Garden gnome.
Matt: "Very well, very well, come in."
Ashley: Hey! (laughter)
Travis: He's drunk.
Taliesin: I'm drunk!
Matt: So the human woman leads you all back in.
Laura: Put the gun down, Percy.
Ashley: Bad News.
Liam: It's not Cinco de Mayo.
Matt: She steps back with her knitted boots; she's definitely in comfortable mode. She eagerly hugs each of you as you enter, happy that you've all arrived, she's like, "I swear it's-- I've not had an employer leave so quickly after my hiring. But glad to see you're all safe. Shall I make everyone a meal, are you hungry?"
Marisha: Starving.
Travis: Yes.
Matt: "I'll get right to it." And she turns around, and you see further down the hallway Erwen Dastell, your older halfling servant who shuffles up with his nightcap on, it's long and dangling off his shoulders, he's got this long night robe on, he's kinda carrying a small candle. "My goodness. The hour is late of your arrival, but I can't say I am not excited to see you. Come in, your beds are ready, everything's been cleaned and made to your specifications. Laina! To food!" "I'm already on it, Erwen." She kinda smacks him on the back. He says, "Very well, then."
Sam: I love their banter.
Laura: Yeah, they're so cute.
Matt: "I will go back to bed, if that's fine with you."
Sam: Is there any urgent, oppressing news, any visitors that we should know about who came while we were gone, anything before you retire for the evening?
Matt: "No, I believe your friend, the mage woman with the blue robes came by once."
Sam: Allara?
Matt: "Allura. She came by a couple days ago, just to see if you had returned. But I didn't know where you were, and she said she'd try again later."
Sam: Any packages, mail, post?
Matt: "None that I know of, no. In fact it's been very quiet."
Sam: All right, thank you.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: Quiet is good.
Matt: "Back to my quarters." And he shuffles off, goes towards his bed. You guys make your way into the main dining chamber of your Keep, four large round tables set out with the chairs around it. You can see, for the most part, it's been untouched other than a couple of chairs that are set ajar, probably by your mercenary soldiers who've been eating and/or have been keeping up. There's a couple of empty tables set on the side that immediately Laina goes, "I'm so sorry, I guess I should've taken care of this." And she stumbles off towards the kitchen and you guys all eventually find yourselves sitting, sore, exhausted, mildly intoxicated, around these chairs and take a very deep-breathing sigh of relief at being back home here in Emon in Greyskull Keep.
Sam: Should we un-stone Kima, or should we sleep on it?
Orion: I stand up and I head towards the sleeping quarters and I just say, "Leave her to stone tonight, we'll deal with it tomorrow." And I go to bed.
Sam: I turn him into a rat.
Liam: Dispel Magic.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, Tiberius.
Orion: Hold on a sec. I can still cast as an animal, right?
Sam: Nope.
Matt: Nope, you cannot talk.
Orion: Oh. I still go to bed. (laughter)
Orion: So yeah.
Travis: Hoo baby.
Laura: That's adorable.
Matt: You go under your covers, go to sleep, nuzzle in.
Orion: In between my pillow.
Marisha: It's quite comfy sleeping like an animal.
Ashley: He's a little rat and he still went in his big bed.
Liam: I pick up the sleeping rat and just kinda scritch him.
Laura: He's in bed.
Liam: It's all right, he's fine. Look, see, his leg's going, he's dreaming about something nice.
Travis: We ate already, right?
Matt: You snacked a bit as you made it through the town, but for the most part like, a meal's being prepared. You begin to smell now the cooking of meat, Laina's setting it up for you guys.
Liam: You're dreaming of magical artifacts, aren't you?
Laura: Quick question, friends  So we kind of started a war, am I right?
Liam: Yeah. Pretty sure we did.
Laura: Kraghammer is potentially in grave danger, am I right?
Marisha: We might want to let them know.
Laura: We should probably let them know as soon as possible.
Liam: First of all, Clarota was lying through his noodles, and second, even if he wasn't, which he was, he's now fucking pissed off--
Laura: He's dead.
Liam: Well, they're all one hive-mind, right? Listen. This is number five tonight.
Taliesin: They weren't particularly connected until the very end, he was dead before they were actually connected.
Liam: They're angry. They were following us.
Taliesin: They may not know who we are.
Marisha: That's interesting.
Liam: You don't think they're going to scurry up the bottom of Kraghammer and tear that place apart?
Taliesin: We'll let them know, but we may have time, we hurt them very badly.
Liam: It took us about a week to get from Kraghammer in, so we've got about a week.
Marisha: Well, why don't we do some research, I mean, this was the first time.
Sam: Yeah, we'd have to stop them on the way out the hole, right? There's only one way in and out.
Ashley: Don't the dwarves already know that they were there, and they were already prepping for battle?
Sam: They don't really know what's coming for them.
Liam: They don't know anything about mind flayers, they know about weird things coming out, but not the mind flayers.
Travis: So let's send a pigeon or something.
Taliesin: The mind flayers have been down there for ages. There's nothing new.
Laura: You don't think they'll come up and attack?
Marisha: To be fair, we also did sort of release the mind flayers from their evil dictator.
Liam: Yeah, they seemed very grateful.
Sam: We could stop them on their way out.
Taliesin: I think this will also be a conversation that Lady Kima will have some--
Marisha: Okay, well, the thing we then need to immediately decide, before we un-stone Lady Kima, is what're we going to do with the Horn?
Taliesin: I think if we have Allura here, and begin that conversation, then we can have Allura's insight.
Marisha: Before we un-stone Lady Kima?
Taliesin: Yes. I think we tell Allura before we un-stone Lady Kima. Everything that's happened--
Liam: The only person, the only person that would remotely know is you, Tiberius, and I don't think--
Sam: He's a rat.
Liam: Oh, that's a good boy.
Travis: And he's asleep.
Liam: He didn't seem to know anything, I think Allura is the person to go to right now.
Laura: Well, you need to share it with us.
Ashley: Wake up from bed!
Travis: He's sleeping.
Taliesin: No, let's wait until Allura's here, I think, and we can--
Travis: Do we tell her, do we tell her we have the Horn? Or do we not?
Liam: Yes, yes, we do.
Marisha: Why don't we just wake up Tiberius?
Laura: Tiberius. Little darling!
Sam: I'm still punishing him.
Liam: I'm still cuddling him.
Orion: Did they wake me up?
Liam: No! I'm holding you.
Orion: Okay.
Liam: I don't want to wake you up.
Matt: You start to wake up, and then he scritches the side of your cheek and you go right back to sleep.
Laura: Damn it, he's so cute. I don't know what to do.
Matt: Laina comes out with plates for you guys and sets up these--
Travis: Thank. God.
Matt: They're not pretty, but functional meals of cooked pork, some fine mashed potatoes.
Travis: I would like to eat.
Matt: And you do ravenously, and this is the first warm meal you've really truly had in five, six days.
Travis: I take Lady Kima's portions and I--
Matt: There were no portions made for your garden structure.
Travis: Never know.
Matt: That's okay, there's plenty more.
Sam: So talk to Allura first, then unfreeze Lady Kima?
Liam: She sent us after Kima. Kima thinks that she's in the middle of a fight, the moment she comes out she'll be all hot and bothered--
Marisha: Okay, hang on, hang on. That's true, she did send us after Kima, so what if they're both on the side that we don't--
Travis: Yeah, Allura's going to unfreeze Kima.
Taliesin: We're going to have to trust somebody.
Travis: Why don't we just hold onto the Horn for a second and see what they do without it.
Laura: Why don't we tell them we didn't find it? Why don't we just hide the Horn?
Travis: We just hold onto it in the bag.
Marisha: Don't we have a safe? Didn't we build a safe in our Keep?
Matt: You did not have a safe built, but you could possibly have that done.
Ashley: Wait, so why are you guys so against giving the Horn to Kima?
Marisha: I just feel like if it's so terrible, why does she want it for herself?
Laura: She doesn't, she wants to hide it.
Ashley: Does she want to destroy it?
Laura: Maybe she wants to destroy it, maybe she wanted to get it up above ground so she could destroy it.
Sam: There's a second Horn, maybe she has the other one and wants the matching set.
Taliesin: Do we know that there's a second horn?
Laura: She's a paladin, she's good, paladins are good by--
Sam: I'm fine trusting her. I was fine trusting Clarota.
Travis: Do you want to wake up, do you have something important to say?
Marisha: Right, because no one of the church has ever been bad before.
Liam: We didn't trust Clarota. We were using him as much as he was using us.
Laura: Some of us truly trusted Clarota.
Liam: It went south. Well, most of us.
Travis: All right, fuck it, I walk over and I take the rat out of Vax's hands and I shake it awake.
Sam: He's still a rat!
Travis: I shake it a lot.
Marisha: I undo his Polymorph, I undo his Polymorph.
Sam: With what?
Matt: With what?
Marisha: By Polymorph.
Matt: You re-Polymorph him?
Marisha: Can I release Polymorph by using Polymorph?
Matt: No. It's his incantation.
Travis: I spit on Tiberius's head and rub it in vigorously.
Marisha: Scanlan, come on. We need to talk to him.
Orion: I'm trying to bite Grog. I am not happy.
Matt: It's like this viscous Grog spit mixed with chunks of pork and mashed potato rubbed in your fur.
Marisha: Scanlan, he's nipping! Scanlan. Tiberius is nipping. Please.
Sam: All right, fine. He's a human thing again.
Liam: He's not human at all.
Sam: A dragonborn.
Orion: Why did you wake me up? I was so comfy being furry! (laughter)
Orion: I always have scales. It was nice having fur!
Marisha: I told you. It's nice being cuddly.
Orion: I was so soft.
Laura: Tiberius, we're sorry to wake you.
Taliesin: Tiberius, we're having a lovely breakfast. Tell us a story.
Orion: Have I rested? What's going on?
Matt: No, it's been ten minutes.
Orion: What the fuck? (laughter)
Travis: Vex has a question for you.
Marisha: We're all still drunk and awake. We don't want to go to bed yet! Just, just talk with us.
Laura: I just want to hear your lovely little explanation, darling, about what the Horn is and why you don't trust Kima.
Orion: Oh!
Taliesin: Tell us a story.
Marisha: Tell us a story!
Laura: Please. You haven't told any of us anything.
Marisha: We haven't talked to you in a week.
Orion: The Horn of Orcus.
Matt: Horn of Orcus.
Orion: This thing comes from a devil, a demon. Nothing good could ever come from anything it made in existence. It needs to be destroyed. And I'm sorry. Let me articulate these words a little bit more. There is nothing that you can use this particular artifact for any reason of good. The fact that it is even here is a very bad sign because it was taken from one of these beasts.
Ashley: So why don't we destroy it?
Orion: That's exactly what we need to do.
Travis: Isn't that what Kima wanted?
Laura: What if they want to destroy it?
Orion: I don't think they wanted to bring it back.
Laura: Question. Why?
Orion: Because there is-- the liquid hot magma that was below where it was being held was very sufficient for it to be thrown in.
Marisha: That's true. See, I'm with him.
Laura: Wait, but your crushing fist couldn't destroy it, so maybe lava can't destroy it, so maybe it needs something extra special that only they know about.
Travis: It needs the Sword of Gryffindor.
Orion: No. Pike could destroy it.
Ashley: Ex-squeeze me? I don't think that's true.
Orion: Give yourself a little bit more credit. You killed a dragon.
Laura: You did kill a dragon.
Travis: You did kill a dragon.
Ashley: I did kill a dragon. Huzzah.
Marisha: And you died. And come back to life. By the way, we haven't talked about that. What was it like on the other side?
Travis: Let's stay on topic here.
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy.
Liam: Vax shoves another flagon in front of Keyleth.
Ashley: I don't think I can destroy it.
Taliesin: From what I understand-- is it possible that it's not possible to destroy this and instead it has to be banished somewhere, perhaps?
Orion: No. If it could be a permanent banishment, yes. But we don't know what kind of plane and what creatures lie there that would, perhaps, come upon that artifact. What are the elements? Fire burns earth.
Laura: Wind blows.
Orion: Light destroys darkness. Pike, you're the only one who--
Sam: Rock beats scissors.
Orion: Exactly, Scanlan. You're the only one who could-- if your weapon had any kind of light enchantment on them, could probably smash this thing to bits. Then we would have to scatter the remnants, the pieces, far from each other, if not find different ways to destroy those pieces.
Laura: Why don't you trust them?
Orion: Because it comes from something that would--
Laura: Not the Horn. Why don't you trust Kima?
Orion: Because they wanted to bring it somewhere where they-- I don't know. Which is why I wanted you to do the half thing, where we could question Kima without her attacking us or trying to attempt to take the Horn from us.
Marisha: Well, here's my thing. Even if she has good intentions. Say she has good intentions and maybe they just wanted to bring the horn back to study it. And no one should be messing with this whatsoever.
Laura: I think they want to destroy it.
Taliesin: I'm of the opinion they probably want to banish it somewhere.
Travis: Yeah, I think they do.
Marisha: Then why don't we just agree to not hand it over.
Taliesin: No, this is good. This means that there's no reason, necessarily, not to trust them. We just know that we don't trust the Horn, and that's a perfectly reasonable way to come at it.
Liam: In the short term, Scanlan, are you able to send it to another dimension for a while?
Laura: No, I don't trust it anywhere out of our sight.
Sam: I cannot. It is not alive. I cannot.
Travis: Put it in the bag.
Laura: It's in the bag.
Taliesin: It's perfectly safe in the bag.
Travis: How about we rest, we put the Horn in the bag, we wake up Kima, we go, "Oh, we brought you back, sorry we don't have the Horn. If we did, what would you do with it?" And then we decide what we do.
Taliesin: I like half that plan.
Marisha: I kind of like that plan.
Orion: I like that plan, too.
Laura: I think we should tell her we didn't get it and see what she does.
Orion: Allura is somebody who should not be here when this conversation happens, because if they turn south, she's a more powerful sorcerer than I.
Marisha: We need to decide, do we tell her that we destroyed it, or do we tell her that we just didn't get it and that it's still down there.
Travis: We can't say destroyed because we don't know how we did that, right?
Laura: No, we didn't destroy it. We say, "Oh no, they, we got overrun and we had to leave."
Taliesin: But then they're going to tell us to go back for it.
Travis: That's fine, but if we ask like what she would've done if we had it, and when she leaves we go, "Hah, we have it."
Laura: Or we go, "Oh, well good, then actually we do have it, you can do that."
Travis: Yeah, if she wants to study it or use it or transform it into something, we don't give it to her, we try to destroy it ourselves. If she wants to banish it and do something that Tiberius is happy with, then we go like, "Hey, we have it."
Liam: When we meet her I don't think we should have it, I think one or two of us should take it away. We don't all have to be at that meeting.
Taliesin: I think we just keep it in the Bag of Holding, she'll never suspect.
Marisha: Well, hang on, it's in the Bag of Holding right now?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yes.
Orion: Grog, is there nothing else in that bag of holding?
Travis: Nothing it can, we took out all the stuff it can turn into some like evil transformer or something.
Liam: You know, the other characters can make insight checks too, you know that, right?
Matt: There's a pile somewhere with armor.
Travis: Everything has out with parentheses next to it.
Liam: If we have it, then she's, she could say you're lying--
Laura: Or she might not be able to tell because we're so good at lying. (laughter)
Liam: I don't think your winks will work on her.
Sam: Legitimately, no one can tell when I'm lying.
Marisha: I mean, we could Stone Shape it and I could like Stone Shape it and bury it somewhere in our Keep.
Travis: One person should leave with it. I'll leave with it.
Liam: Yes, it's fucking simple.
Taliesin: That's genius.
Travis: Yeah, I'll leave. It's not like I'm going to talk to the sorcerers.
Liam: You and I could take a walk with it and play tiddlywinks or something in the woods. That's fine, what's wrong with that, it's easy.
Taliesin: That's a very good plan.
Orion: Do you want it very far away?
Travis: Yeah, you're a talker, I'm not.
Taliesin: No, we don't.
Marisha: Wait. You're talking about just taking a stroll through the forest with the Horn of Orcus?
Travis: No, I'll just hang out outside.
Orion: In the Keep, how about just stay in the Keep?
Liam: Just be somewhere else. Anywhere else.
Ashley: You could hang out in the temple downstairs.
Laura: I fall asleep on the table.
Travis: Shall we sleep?
Sam: Let's sleep and meet with Kima in the morning.
Taliesin: This was a fabulous breakfast, good night.
Liam: Vax gives his sleeping sister a wet willie.
Laura: Ugh!
Travis: I put my head right in my food and fall asleep.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Let's not forget, you've still got a funny toe.
Sam: I check my bed to make sure no one shat in it. (laughter)
Orion: I did leave a little rat turd before I got scooped out. Just so you know.
Laura: Trinket, let's go to bed.
Marisha: I turn, I go Minxie and I curl up by the fire.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie!
Liam: Scanlan! Turn Tiberius back into a rat.
Orion: Oh yes, I'm going to bed.
Liam: Back into a rat.
Marisha: You can curl up with me.
Sam: Would you like to be a rat?
Orion: I like being furry.
Sam: Well then, no. I'm still punishing you. (laughter)
Orion: That's fine. Have your fun tonight, people, you will have your licking in the morning. I go to sleep.
Matt: All right. You guys all go to rest for the evening, the best rest you've had in a long time, your beds are comfortable, well set, it's a warm interior.
Ashley: I'm starfished on my bed.
Matt: This is the first time in a while that Pike, you've been able to sleep without your armor on, and it's so nice.
Laura: That's great.
Matt: You sleep hard, you sleep for an extended period, eventually you all begin to rouse, as you all wake up, the smell of fresh breakfast food is already coming to--
Laura: That and Pike's stank from her armor.
Matt: Yeah, you're going to have to wash that armor, girl.
Travis: It's like when you take a cast off, you're like, ugh.
Matt: It's bad.
Marisha: Actually, is there a bath house in the village?
Matt: You haven't inquired. You could ask around if you want.
Marisha: We should have a girls' day at the bath house.
Orion: I woke up and took a dirt bath.
Liam: You're not a rat, though.
Matt: Yeah. Oh, but he didn't transform you, though.
Orion: Huh?
Matt: He didn't transform you.
Orion: I know, in lizard form.
Sam: Gross.
Orion: In my form.
Taliesin: That's awesome.
Orion: Scales, you rub it off with clay?
Matt: Yeah, there you go. Out in the front of the Keep.
Laura: Gross!
Orion: I have a little dirt in my room.
Laura: A little pile of grossness.
Liam: We just don't fear for our lives for the first time.
Sam: Let's go down and have our meeting.
Matt: So you guys head down into the dining room again, Kima's still standing there with the maul, left where she was. Grog is still face-down like on the table, grabbed the plate up against his face with mashed potatoes across his cheek. Across the way at the far table, you see Cordell and Shayne are both finishing their breakfast, and are sitting there at the table with their arms kind of gathering as you enter. "Morning!" "Morning." And they both kind of finish their meal. Get up and stand up. "Enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it." "I think our shift is done." She pats Cordell and they both get up and they exit out.
Laura: Have a good night! I know, I know, but they're sleeping.
Travis: I start awake with food on my face and I wipe it off and eat it. "I had a horrible dream about two walking testicles that were hurting my mind."
Sam: That was no dream! (laughter)
Liam: I am so sad that you woke up. I was just about to go to the hearth and get some ash and draw a penis on your head.
Travis: I had a feeling something was coming.
Liam: Next thing out of my mouth, that's a promise.
Ashley: Where's the Bag of Holding?
Travis: I've got it.
Ashley: Can you check in your bag to see if the Horn is still there?
Laura: And it's okay?
Travis: I look in the bag of holding and I see a Horn?
Matt: You look in the bag and you see nothing. You imagine something, you reach in, you pull it out.
Taliesin: Don't do that.
Laura: How are we going to get it out of there?
Orion: I can.
Ashley: Can you tell if it's in there?
Sam: Can you teleport something out of a bag?
Orion: It's Telekinesis, I can picture it and--
Laura: Teleport it, can you pull it out and make sure it's still there and okay?
Matt: Okay. So you use Telekinesis, you lift the Horn out--
Orion: No, I don't do it. I'm assuming it's there. I'm not doing that right now.
Laura: Wait, no, check though, I want to make sure it's okay.
Orion: I'm pretty sure it's there.
Laura: But I want to make sure.
Sam: All right, I will check with Mage Hand or whatever, I got something else. Mage Hand, yeah, I'll Mage Hand it.
Matt: Mage Hand gently and slowly lifts it out, you can see the Horn kinda holds there for a second, it moves very slowly.
Travis: Yeah, put it back in.
Matt: Put it back in the bag.
Travis: Thank you, tie it up tight. I'm going to go down to the, what is it, the temple below the thingie?
Ashley: Okay, yeah, go down to the temple.
Travis: All right, I'm going to go play in the dark with myself. That sounded wrong.
Matt: Okay, so you head down into the temple to Sarenrae, which is beautiful, it's all like a giant two-story stained glass three-set walls with trees and hedges set up and flowers, bunch of wooden kind of long benches set up towards this, the altar in the center, it's beautiful, especially this time of day, it's close to noon right now so the sun's streaking through the top of it, and it's cascading through the tree boughs of the two trees that are closest to the entrance. It's a beautiful sight. Even you, Grog, are moved.
Travis: Just because I'm nervous, I reach into the Bag of Holding and pull out a vial of holy oil that I have. I have three vials of holy oil and I just hold it in one hand while I'm down there.
Matt: All right. So while he's down there, the rest of you guys, what're you doing?
Orion: I'm going to cast Circle of Teleportation in my room.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: No, I'm going to go to the treasury first, I'm going to take out 500 gold pieces, and then I'm going to go to my room and cast Circle of Teleportation.
Matt: Okay. Tiberius is gone.
Sam: Let's heal Kima.
Laura: You just left us?
Orion: By the blessing of Bahamut, I choose Draconia.
Matt: Tiberius is gone.
Ashley: Okay, so, I'm going to stand behind Kima and--
Taliesin: We're going to face her towards the wall.
Ashley: Face her towards the wall.
Liam: Good idea.
Ashley: Or towards something happy.
Taliesin: We're ready to pull you away when she starts to move.
Ashley: Yeah, okay. So.
Marisha: Wait! Are we unfreezing her?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: No, I thought we were going to talk to Allura first.
Laura: No, we're going to talk to her first.
Marisha: Oh wait, that's right. And we were going to do that thing.
Laura: You were drunk, it's okay.
Marisha: That's right, I was probably tipsy, sorry. We came up with like eight plans last night.
Laura: You were so drunk.
Sam: Wait, shouldn't Grog be here, he's the one who likes her.
Travis: Oh, the things I sacrifice for the group.
Ashley: So I cast Greater Restoration on Kima.
Laura: And then run away!
Matt: Okay, you reach out and touch the back of Kima. Her stone armor turns to gold and rapidly her entire form goes back to flesh. As she finishes her swing with the maul (impact sound) against the stone wall. And she kinda steps back for a second, confused, and looks over her shoulder at the rest of you.
Sam: Everything's okay, everything's okay, we're out of danger, we're at home, it's okay.
Laura: It's fine, it's fine, guess what, we are alive.
Sam: We lived.
Matt: Just drops the maul for a second and kinda leans back against the wall.
Marisha: I just get the leftover mashed potatoes from breakfast.
Matt: "Thank you, thank you, oh thank you. What happened?" She's not even using utensils, she's just like scooping it with her hand at this point.
Laura: So we killed K'Varn, right?
Matt: "Obviously."
Sam: Funny story, you were right about Clarota. He was horrible, we killed him. We killed him! Hey, you were right.
Laura: But not before we were overrun with a bunch of evil brothers of his.
Taliesin: And we got a very fancy hat out of it.
Laura: Hey, right, look at his hat.
Sam: We should've known all along, you were right, we should've trusted you, sorry.
Matt: "It's all right. He had his uses, certainly."
Liam: You were right, we were wrong, you're very attractive, we're all quite ugly.
Matt: "That isn't necessary, but the compliment is appreciated, regardless. Thank you for bringing me back with you. You could have easily left me back and I appreciate that you took the time."
Sam: So, you're alive, that's good because you were sorta on a suicide mission.
Matt: "Not a suicide mission."
Laura: What exactly was your mission, Kima?
Matt: "Where's the Horn?"
Laura: Well, thing is, it's not here.
Matt: "All right. It's not with the illithid, is it?"
Sam: It's in a safe place.
Matt: "How safe?"
Laura: Pretty safe.
Taliesin: Why, what can it do?
Matt: She looks visually nervous and she goes--
Laura: Nothing can touch it.
Matt: "Well, that's what the Order that originally sealed it believes. Even if it's somewhere safe temporarily, we can possibly relocate it. But we have to-- (sighs)"
Liam: You saw your mission as a suicide mission, but if you had secured it, what were your plans? What was plan B? What were you going to do?
Matt: "Well, if I were to fall in the process of trying to get the Horn, others would come after me. I sent word to my Order that if I did not return they would send more."
Laura: Can I insight?
Matt: Go for it, yeah, go ahead and roll insight.
Laura: 19.
Sam: Ooh!
Marisha: Whisper time! Sweet, sweet whispers.
Sam: Keep subscribing, guys, because whispering action doesn't come free.
Marisha: How many subscribers away are we?
Lucas: 38.
Marisha: 38 subscribers.
Travis: That's a lot.
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: That's a lot.
Marisha: That is still a lot.
Sam: Keep subscribing to Geek and Sundry, where you can watch Matt Mercer whisper at people.
Matt: And she goes, "So this Horn, which is one of two, if Allura is correct, was sealed a thousand or so years ago by those who originally cut it from the head of the avatar of Orcus of which it was bestowed. They, once he was slain, did everything they could within their power to destroy it, yet this artifact, instilled with the purity of Orcus, was indestructible to their knowledge. So the least they could do was to seal both horns across the world from each other and forget that it even existed. Which worked well until recently. It wasn't until these visions came to me and other members of my Order that we knew that this, this was a thing, and me being the closest in my pilgrimage, we took that as time of the essence I was to go in there with a team and retrieve it. If it couldn't be destroyed, at the very least we could convene and decide a safer place to possibly reseal it and forget. There are magical ways of forcing those of us who know how to forget. That would be the safest thing for it. If there is a way to destroy it, we don't know, but that could also be sought after. We have arcane and divine knowledge we didn't have back then, so, in the long run it needs to be retrieved, the longer it stays down there in the Underdark, no matter where you placed it, it draws like a beacon all darkness to it until something else like this beholder K'Varn will take up the mantle and themselves be as dangerous or more so than he ever was."
Laura: So the other Horn is still safe?
Matt: "As far as I know. The visions only gave me access to where this one was. I can only assume that it's out there, but if someone else were to find it, I would know that they probably have knowledge of the second one existing, as well. I don't know if K'Varn shared this information, but if someone else takes the mantle of this Horn, what's to stop them from seeking the other?"
Liam: Bummer.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: "Regardless, I appreciate that we're all alive and we're together, and where are we?"
Laura: Oh, you're in our home.
Sam: Greyskull Keep. It's in Emon.
Matt: "We're in Emon?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "Well, that's wondrous, we can speak with Allura. She would have the wisdom to know what to do with this next."
Sam: Hypothetical. What if an army of darkness was slowly approaching Emon to kill all of us?
Matt: "What are you saying?"
Sam: Well, we killed Clarota and K'Varn, but we, there was a lot of bad guys down there that we could not kill--
Laura: We hurt that Elder Brain real bad, but not bad enough.
Matt: "I don't know much about the illithid themselves, but they reside deep and they are not fans of the surface. I believe that it was K'Varn's initial onset that was pushing them, both in union with the duergar and pushing them towards the siege. They spoke of something about bringing twilight to the surface world. I don't know what that was about, but I fear what knowledge they have if left alone. At the very least, I know that they're probably having to return and lick their wounds where we left behind. It would be folly for them, especially knowing that we're aware, to attack now."
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: "But we can notify those in Kraghammer to buffer their defenses, close the tunnels that you took down there and my army as well, and that should give us time to prepare if we choose to seize or at least seal them off."
Laura: And your Order is what?
Matt: "The Order of the Platinum Dragon."
Laura: Right. That's a really good Order, right?
Taliesin: History check, can I do a history check?
Matt: It's a religion check.
Taliesin: That's a religion check, not history check?
Marisha: Pike.
Matt: You could roll a history check and probably gain some knowledge based on that, but the--
Ashley: Could I do it?
Matt: If you'd like to.
Ashley: Are you doing a religion check, Percy?
Taliesin: I'm doing a history check, if you want to do a religion check.
Ashley: I'll do a religion check.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 22.
Ashley: So fucking close.
Matt: I mean, you guys are familiar loosely with the name Bahamut, you've heard Tiberius bring it up before, you've seen temples to it, but your knowledge knows that Bahamut is very well regarded as the lawful good deity of justice and honor and is primarily one of the great good gods of this pantheon.
Taliesin: If we're going to trust anyone, I think this is a good--
Travis: Yeah, I feel pretty good about this.
Taliesin: I trust the organization, they have a sterling reputation.
Marisha: So, Kima. Pie-in-the-sky goal? You would destroy the Horn?
Matt: "If we had the means of doing so, yes. We'd have to talk to the Order, we'd have to talk to the Council, we'd have to bring people that we could trust and that had the capabilities of knowing if this were possible how we would go about it. It's beyond my knowledge."
Liam: I think what worries us is anyone coming in contact with it would be corrupted.
Matt: "Don't go into contact with it."
Laura: No.
Liam: No, of course.
Marisha: Just within range.
Sam: Yes, is proximity okay?
Matt: "I don't know, I saw it for as long as you did."
Laura: This could be bad.
Sam: Evil Grog?
Laura: Kind of uncomfortable.
Matt: "The essence of most artifacts like this, it goes more than just touch, one has to be imbued, bond with these artifacts, to attune with them like any powerful magical item to truly gain its power, but that's not to say that itself does not contain some sort of foul intelligence."
Ashley: Can I go downstairs and go get Grog?
Matt: Okay. So you walk your way down.
Travis: (sings) I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.
Matt: As you're walking past, as you walk past you are immediately met in the hallway by Erwen, your servant, your halfling elder servant who walks up and says, "Dear, I wanted to let you know that a scroll came for you, some sort of a summons." And he hands it to you.
Ashley: Me?
Sam: Probably jury duty.
Matt: And he kinda walks past you in the tunnel.
Taliesin: Always the worst time.
Matt: You open it up a little bit, it's not, hasn't been opened, you kinda pull the paper and open it up. It's a summon to the Council of Tal'Dorei, it's written by the hand of the clerk, and it says, essentially, the sovereign Uriel has been notified of your arrival and would like to see you at the council chambers posthaste.
Ashley: Okay. I'm still going to go get Grog, but I'll pass the scroll around. Hey Grog, come upstairs.
Travis: Oh yeah?
Marisha: That was for all of us?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: It was addressed to Vox Machina.
Travis: Is it clear?
Ashley: Just don't say anything yet, but just come upstairs.
Travis: Did she ask about me?
Laura: She definitely did.
Ashley: She did, yeah.
Travis: With my bald head.
Matt: All right. You make your way back in, Kima finishes her meal, and you guys are chatting a bit, she's just like, "All right, if I may ask, how did you seal it? I feel uncomfortable knowing the process and that it's at least safe."
Marisha: Oh, we have one of the best defense mechanisms. Grog!
Travis: Hello, Lady Kima.
Laura: It's in a very secure magical item.
Matt: She glances at you and goes, "All right, very well. Just be mindful that you don't go reaching in there."
Marisha: I use my Druidcraft as he enters to make little sparkles and lightning bugs appear around him. "Grog!"
Matt: Lady Kima, who is currently covered in dirt and sweat, still in the golden armor that she wrestled from the long-dead corpse of a dwarf in the Underdark, her chin is smattered with dried mashed potatoes and a bit of her breakfast, kinda gives--
Laura: So she's covered in food as well.
Matt: (laughs) Gives you a look as you're walking in like. "It's good to see you alive, friend."
Travis: Yeah, more than alive, I think.
Ashley: And also, he actually pulled you out of the cavern with one arm while you were stone. Out of the whole place.
Travis: Oh, stop, I don't like to brag.
Matt: She stands up and kinda wipes the food off her chin, clutches her symbol, and then steps right before you, looking up towards your face and says, "I thank you, friend Grog."
Laura: Friendzoned!
Matt: And then reaches out and gives you a big hug.
Liam: Plus he decided not to put you in the magical bag when you were a statue.
Matt: She releases Grog slightly, and kinda gives you a keen look and goes, "Also appreciated."
Travis: Yeah, well, you know.
Laura: Oh my god, thank god.
Sam: Why don't you go rest? We'll summon Allura and we'll continue the conversation from there, I guess.
Matt: "Please, I'd love to see her, it's been too long. All right, I'm going to, is there a room I could rest?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: You could use my room.
Taliesin: There's a guest room.
Laura: Yes, we have a guest room.
Sam: We should use it.
Orion: I would've had your back, by the way, there.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Erwen, who's by the door, leads her to the guest room and you guys take a moment to rest. We'll go ahead and pick up next session at that point, where Allura's being brought in, so we'll stop the game there as I have to rush to the airport, but before that we have some gifts to open from you guys.
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Huh?
Travis: You're rushing to the airport tonight?
Matt: Yeah, I got a redeye, 1AM. To be in Sandusky, Ohio. At Collisi--er no, Collosalcon. Please come.
Travis: You're going to do the waterslides, right? You won't ride waterslides?
Matt: It'll be fun. Guys, thank you so much for watching, that was a lot of fun.
Sam: We lived!
Matt: And everyone lived! Barely.
Marisha: We lived!
Matt: Barely, oh my god.
Marisha: Holy shit, we lived.
Travis: One roll away from her being--
Ashley: That was rough.
Matt: Her and Scanlan.
Laura: One point, twice.
Matt: Twice for you.
Travis: Twice.
Taliesin: I'm going to go get our d20s back.
Marisha: Crazyballs. Oh yeah. We had two sparkles and a green one.
Ashley: I was just rolling bad.
Zac: Hey, guys. We got some gifts for you from the chatroom. Some letters.
Liam: I got an Asus computer with an "aren't we clever" sticker on it?
Marisha: Sweet.
Zac: Man, I'll give you an "aren't we clever" sticker if you want, it's worth about the same. We also have some donations to read off. (cheering)
Zac: So guys, as long as we're live, that subscriber giveaway still stands.
Laura: How far away are we from it?
Zac: 36 subs away from another giveaway. All right.
Matt: All right.
Zac: If you want to go ahead and, actually I don't know if she wanted this to be read. Oh, okay, but this is cool. Do you want to hand me those disposable cameras? Where did he go? Oh, I lost him.
Matt: Essentially it says, "Vox Machina, I have sent you a disposable camera. Basically I had this idea to send this to you and have you guys go crazy, fill up the camera with random shenanigans, whether it's behind-the-scenes, setup during a stream, or elsewise of your shoes, and then once you guys have filled both cameras, you can send them back with the already printed label included in the box I sent this in, send it back to me, I can get the pictures printed and doubled and then send you guys a set back once they're developed."
Marisha: Aw, that's a good idea!
Matt: "I thought it'd be something different for you guys to do, hopefully you enjoy it and I can't wait to hear back from you. Becca."
Marisha: That's fun!
Matt: Thank you so much, Becca.
Marisha: Awesome.
Ashley: Thank you, Becca.
Matt: Yeah, we'll keep the rest to ourselves. We've got an awesome picture of Grog and Mustang Scanlan. Look at that.
Taliesin: (sings) Mustang Scanlan.
Travis: Horse head. Evil horse head of doom.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Marisha: (sing) Slow your mustang down.
Matt: All right, here we go.
Zac: All right, so let's get through these messages here.
Matt: All right, let's get this going, because I've got to get running soon.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right, we have Jasonofarabia, heart, "Got up at 5am to watch you guys live, great show." That's awesome, donated $100.

Zac: Oh, Minecraft server.
Matt: Minecraft server surprise for you. "Come to these coordinates--" We have the coordinates here. "--and you will find your temple."
Zac: Somebody should probably write this down.
Matt: "1350 by 1350 z."
Zac: 1350 x.
Matt: "1350 x by 1350 z and you will find your temple of Sarenrae."
Ashley: Wait, 1350 z by 1350 x?
Zac: 1350 x by--
Zac: -- 1350 z.

Marisha: That's where all of our crits were going.
Matt: "By the way, Matt, when I get my copy of Arkham Knight, is it possible to get it sent somewhere for an autograph?" Send it to this studio with return post, we're happy to do that. That's fine. As long as it's sent with return postage already paid, I'll be happy to sit here one of these days.
Laura: That's an important thing, return postage.

Taliesin: Otherwise, hey, free copy for us, which is really cool.
Marisha: Take the disc out, send back the case.

Marisha: Love it.
Zac: I'm going to have to remember that move.
Matt: Yeah, you should. All right. Rona Konandario. "A friend showed me Critical Role a few weeks ago, just as our long-time group of friends started our game. It must've been destiny. I love everyone's genuine feelings towards all the aspects of the game. Expect fanart in the future. Much love." Donated $10. Thank you so much, Runa Konandario.

Laura: This is for me?
Matt: That is for you.
Laura: Holy crap!
Sam: Wait, Laura, what did you get?
Matt: Oh my god, you got Jonathan Frakes signed?
Sam: Is he a fan of the show?
Matt: I'm sorry, Laura, what's this you have signed over here?
Laura: Oh my gosh. You'll always be my Number One.
Zac: This is for you to give to--
Laura: This is from Team Wishlist. Thank you so much!

Matt: That's amazing.
Taliesin: That is so badass.
Matt: I'm going to say that's the keen dagger.
Laura: Look at how many daggers he has now! Ludicrous.
Liam: Just ten more.
Marisha: So many daggers.
Matt: All righty, guys, so. As a heads-up. "Attn Geek and Sundry Twitch. To the awesome people at Geek and Sundry, please forward this package to the members of Critical Role on my behalf. I have made them each a personalized pendant with their character names, plus a few extras. Earrings inspired by Keyleth, Pike, and Vex'ahlia for Marisha, Ashley, and Laura, and four Vox Machina pendants which can be kept or given away. Many thanks to all involved for making Critical Role possible. Those short videos of their campaign on Vine were never enough to know what was going on. Sincerely yours, Ipec Psy." That's so awesome. Thank you so much, Ipec. Okay, pass this down to Percy?
Orion: I got this amazing Tiberius pin.
Laura: So cute!
Taliesin: So fantastic.
Zac: Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, it's got a little deck.
Orion: Pike. Ashley. A three-inch figure of Pike is coming for you and a three-inch figure of Scanlan is coming. They're on their way.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Orion: David.
Matt: It's your holy symbol.
Marisha: They're little flowers!
Zac: Hey, guys, we have some boxes of very special dice here, and they included a letter, but it says, "Please do not read on stream," so this is for you guys to read when we go offline, but we're going to hand these out as well.
Marisha: Holy crap.
Laura: Oh, this is for me!
Marisha: I'm pretty sure she has an Etsy store.
Taliesin: She does.
Laura: Oh my god, this is the best day ever.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous!
Liam: It's Critmas!
All: Critmas!
Liam: Whoa, look at that. That's a die, it's dangerous.
Travis: No it's not.
Matt: That's so cool, you guys are ridiculous.
Sam: Whoa, that's an awesome die!
Travis: Are you fucking kidding me?
Sam: Whoa, the first roll was a 20! (cheering)
Laura: This will never go in the dice graveyard.
Zac: Each one is unique to you guys, it's nuts.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: Skulls!
Ashley: What? I got a Celtic knot!
Laura: This is the coolest thing ever.
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Marisha: What does yours look like?
Taliesin: Holy shit.
Laura: Let me see!
Ashley: Nice, what the heck!
Travis: It's made of skulls.
Laura: Wow, I got a 20!
Marisha: Whoa, with the whitewash on it.
Zac: Okay, wait.
Taliesin: I just rolled a 20! Look at it, look at it!
Marisha: Wait, did everyone roll 20s on their first roll?
Matt: These are magically enchanted handcrafted dice.
Travis: I rolled an eight.
Marisha: I rolled a four.
Matt: I got a Sputnik dice, by the way.
Ashley: Thank you so much!
Taliesin: Thank you so much!
Marisha: These are crazy! Holy balls!
Sam: Okay, a benefactor sent the holy charm of Sarenrae for me to present to you.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, that's so pretty!
Sam: In, I think, holy matrimony?
Ashley: Oh, well, let's just--
Matt: Ellie, these are all amazing. Thank you so much.
Laura: Thank you, thank you.
Ashley: Thank you, thank you.
Orion: A dragon-bone die for the dragonborn.
Matt: I've rolled nothing lower than a 16 on this die, so it gets used a lot moving forward.
Liam: Also, for my birthday I got (Gollum voice) precious.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Orion: Good job, guys.
Matt: You guys are ridiculous.
Zac: You guys are all going to post pictures to Twitter, right, because everyone's asking.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah. Oh yeah, this is happening.
Liam: (Gollum voice) Precious!
Zac: While these guys are still opening their presents, I wanted to-- go ahead.
Marisha: Ellie, whoever made the jewelry, to tweet at us and let us know her Etsy store.
Matt: Ellie did the dice, wasn't it, I think?
Marisha: Ellie did the dice.
Matt: Yeah, the pendants were--
Zac: Ellie did the dice.
Marisha: The pendants were from Ipec.
Laura: Oh, I've got to get all my presents in the picture.
Marisha: From @millena, let us know about your Etsy.
Ashley: Guys, thanks so much.
Matt: An awesome letter from Meghan Levann, cards from Meghan Levann's site, we're going to go ahead and pass these out, and I'll read this after the stream. That's so awesome, thank you so much, Meghan.
All: Thank you, Meghan!
Zac: While these guys are still going through their presents, I just want to remind you guys, thank you for tuning in, and tomorrow we have So You Don't Have To, and we're going to play Jazz Punk on the stream, and it's a lot of fun, and then after that we'll have Gather Your Party and IndieKate is joining us, the all-female punk band Blood Candy is joining us, and then we have the-- oh my gosh, I feel like a dumb-dumb now. What's the name of that-- the Dance Free Movement people? The group that threw the party for the guy that was shamed on the internet, the--
Matt: Mercer shirt. Dice on the back. DM represent.
Zac: I'm sure a lot of you guys heard about the man that was shamed on the internet.
Marisha: Yeah, the punk teenagers made fun of him?
Zac: Right. Made fun of him on the internet, and a large group of-- the Dance Free Movement came Together, flew him out to Los Angeles, and threw a big party for him, so we have the Dance Free Together group coming tomorrow to play Just Dance with us, to talk about their movement and everything like that, so make sure you guys tune in tomorrow, it's going to be a lot of a fun, that's from 7-10PM. And we had a couple more donations really quickly come in. Just wanted to say thank you to--
Matt: What's that?
Lucas: Did you read the dice on the shirt?
Matt: (laughs) Nice and hidden. Didn't notice that. The dice say, 'How do you want to do this?'
Laura: Awesome!
Taliesin: That's so cool.
Laura: Oh, that's really cool.
Zac: For the people that donated after we started reading the donations, I know Matt's trying to get outta here pretty quick, so thank you, FoxyForsythe, Zopher, Metheram and Hunter, I'll make sure these guys get the messages that you guys sent, but we're going to go ahead and let these guys start packing up. I know that they have lives!
Marisha: We're tweeting pictures of our dice and our things so everyone can see now.
Laura: I'm hashtagging Critmas.
Zac: Did we make that sub goal?
Orion: Oh my god, is that your die that you got?
Zac: We did not make the sub goal, so we'll get you guys-- no, we're not going to get it, so we'll get you guys with a giveaway tomorrow.
Matt: Next time, you can do it then. You guys are ridiculous, thank you so much. Have a wonderful night.
Ashley: Thank you guys so, so much.
Matt: See you next week on Thursday.
Marisha: We love you guys, you're amazing! [dramatic music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome back to Critical Role this week, ladies and gentlemen, where a bunch of us awesome voice actors get together and play Dungeons and Dragons weekly. We have the return of some of our fantastic guests from last week, but we'll get to them in just a second. But first, let's go ahead and get you started with our fancy intro. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back! (giggles) Welcome back. We got most everyone here right now. Travis is on his way. He flew all the way from Alaska, and thanks to some delays-- weather and everything-- he's getting here as fast as he can, so we may have a Grog arriving a little late during today's session.  Pretty late for today's session. But in the meantime, our illustrious Laura Bailey will be controlling Grog.
Laura: (Grog voice) I would like to rage!
Matt: Excited for that prospect. It should be a lot of fun. So also want to thank you again, our invited guests returning for their second week. We have Felicia Day and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. Thank you, guys.
Mary: Pleasure is mine.
Laura: Pleasure.
Mary: Pleasure.
Felicia: Pleasure. I smell like peanut butter.
Matt: That's delightful.
Felicia: That's why I smelled my fingers earlier.
Mary: Is this a normal thing, or just today?
Felicia: I just was like, hi! (sniffs)
Sam: That's normally how people greet me.
Felicia: If you smelled like grape jelly, we would be BFFs! Anyway, hi.
Matt: So welcome back. Well, cool. Before we get into it, a couple of quick announcements. One. For every 100 subs that we get during the show tonight, we'll be giving away our packages that include a picture of the Critical Role cast, signed, a Player's Handbook for Dungeons and Dragons, signed by the cast of Critical Role. We'll also be giving away a copy of Felicia's awesome new book that she's about to go on a book tour for. (cheering)
Sam: And it doesn't look like some self-published thing, that looks like a real-- whoa!
Felicia: Not to insult self-published things, but it's legit. There is a sparkle on my dress. That is a very high-class sparkle.
Sam: Does it have a barcode on it?
Felicia: That is an android, that's why I look so trim there. Yeah, but the book's coming out on Tuesday! So I'll be going on book tour, so if you guys want to come see me, I'm going to 12 cities. Sorry Midwest. I'm sorry. You're so angry at me. Anyway, thank you, yeah.
Matt: Awesome, cool, well you guys get some copies of that coming through. We also have a bunch of other random goodies we'll be throwing in with these packages that include other awesome DND stuff and comics and it'll be a little surprise, so for every 100 subscribers, we'll be giving one of those packages away, so that'll be fun. Also wanted to do a quick announcement for one of our friends recently put up a project here. Marisha, if you want to do the intro.
Marisha: Yes! Hi everybody. Okay, so. Boonzy Arts-- they make geeky candles. They have a Kickstarter right now called Wheel of Flame, and they're making essentially DND thematic immersive candles that smell like the environments that you're in! This one is Dragon's Lair and it's smoky and musky.
Matt: We're going to be lighting this tonight.
Laura: Is there moldy dungeon smell?
Marisha: They're coming out with a few more because their Kickstarter's doing pretty well.
Matt: Basement tavern refuse candle.
Taliesin: Ogre's nest.
Marisha: I think they're making a tavern one.
Sam: Bed crap? (laughter)
Matt: That's a Critical Role exclusive. The Scanlan offshoot.
Marisha: Yeah, I think they have one that's Elven Forest, that smells like a forest and they have one that's Sorcerer's Lair, that smells like sage and stuff. But yeah, Wheel of Flame is their Kickstarter. Go check them out, I know they have a limited amount of candles they can give out. Also, there's a d20 hidden in every candle, so when the wax melts, you get a d20!
Laura: That's lovely.
Marisha: So yeah! Check them out. Wheel of Flame.
Matt: Great. Thank you, Marisha. (cheering)
Matt: So much flame. So yeah, for all you guys who pay the extra subscription dollars for the smell-o-vision twitch stream, you will be able to also experience the sensory death of the party.
Laura: Why would you say that?
Matt: You guys picked it. But yeah, so that's actually pretty cool. Hopefully there's not a flammable d20 in there somewhere. That would be problematic.
Felicia: That was weird.
Sam: That happens all the time.
Felicia: Is it really just random kiss-bys? Drive-by kiss?
Matt: Two weeks in a row. We already have a winner?
Zac: PrimeJohn1.
Matt: PrimeJohn1 is our first winner! Congratulations, PrimeJohn1.
Sam: PJ Uno!
Felicia: Did you have to rename him?
Sam: Well, I gave him a nickname to the nickname.
Felicia: That's really adorable. It's a sub-nickname.
Sam: A sub-nick! (laughter)
Felicia: It'll eventually just be like (grunts).
Matt: Awesome, so let's go ahead and jump in here. Anyone else have any other announcements they want to say before we get into the game?
Laura: Travis and I will be in Vancouver next weekend. Not this coming weekend, but the weekend after. But we're not going to be here next week, so yeah, should say that.
Matt: Awesome, so in Vancouver?
Laura: It's a con. And you should come say hi.
Matt: In Vancouver.
Laura: In Vancouver. Go look at my Twitter. You'll see what it is about.
Matt: There you go. Vancouver convention. Laura and Travis; it's going to be awesome. Also, me and Marisha are flying out early morning tomorrow to a convention called AkaiCon that's over in Tennessee, so we'll be there this weekend. So if any of you guys are over there on the eastern seaboard and that vicinity that want to come say hi and hang out with us for the weekend, we have a bunch of fun panels and stuff, so. AkaiCon. Come say hi.
Felicia: That smells delicious. I want to eat it. Or is that you? No, it's not you.
Sam: No, I rubbed peanut butter all over my chest. (laughs)
Matt: Homeopathic VapoRub, really.
Sam: Oh wow, I do smell it now. Yeah, that's nice.
Taliesin: Nothing fun right now.
Felicia: Does it smell like ogre butt, because isn't that what we're doing? Troll butt?
Matt: Oh, and I also wanted to give a big thanks out to Obsidian! They actually approved my use of the Pillars of Eternity soundtrack in our music for the show. So now I'll be able to use elements of their soundtrack for our game, so thank you guys. And I guess, let's get into this game. So. Where we left off. Our party of adventurers, Vox Machina, had broken a few rules in the city of Vasselheim and had actually infracted upon a contract for a guild of creature hunters known as the Slayer's Take. And this group essentially told Vox Machina that either they could go and be arrested for this and put on trial for breaking the law, or they could go and join the guild, as such could be included and written onto the contract and everything would be fine. So they decided to go that route. They inquired with the Huntmaster, and she basically told the party that they could join after they went through a trial where they had to complete a contract. However, she hand-chose and divided the party into two separate, smaller groups. The first group being the one that began playing with us last week, in which we had the illustrious Scanlan, Percy, Vex, and Grog paired up with two new adventurers, one of which was Zahra the tiefling warlock, who also is a prospective interested person to join the guild, the Slayer's Take, and Felicia's character, Lyra, the human wizard, who somehow became a member of the guild and is assigned on her first-ever excursion to lead this group towards the end of their contract. Now, you the audience chose the creature which they were going to hunt, and you voted on an adult white dragon. So they've been hunting that.
Laura: I didn't realize the audience chose that.
Felicia: Thanks, guys. (laughter)
Matt: So after stalking your way up the Glasswalk Road to the north of the city of Vasselheim, through the Vesper Timberlands, through the cold weather as you continue to travel northward on the word of a crazed gentleman in a tavern somewhere who supposedly saw a dragon, you managed to knock over your flask. You managed to see such a dragon skulking through the skies and actually attacking near where you were staying. While you were sleeping, a group of orcs and some ogrish creature and a dire wolf, attacked your group, you managed to slaughter the encroaching evils, rather rapidly in a daring display of butt-flap long-john Percy. (laughter)
Matt: Some majestic combat prowess you guys managed to completely eliminate. You interrogated one of the orcs before Grog decided to take his head off. It pushed you north, north-west direction within the forest itself. You managed to come upon what looked to be a perpetual blizzard that was blowing around this mountain range, and the dragon was sighted again taking its rest to the north part of this mountain. You pushed through the forest, managed to avoid a few possible dangerous situations, thanks to your ranger guiding you through her favored terrain, eventually coming upon the base of this mountain range. Now, you looked above and you saw what looked like the entrance to a cavern where at least the dragon seems to fly in and out of. It's a ways up the mountain, and there was a smaller cavern towards the base of the mountain. You went to inquire what was in there, at which point out of nowhere, a giant rock made of solid ice and stone was flung out of the forest, slamming into Vex, knocking her onto her ass and doing a decent amount of physical damage.
Laura: 30. 30 points.
Matt: 30 points physical damage to the ranger, at which point two frost giants seemed to, one coming out of that cavern, another seemed to be stalking through the woods, approached the party and that is where we left off. So to begin this, I would like everyone to roll initiative.
Felicia: But they're friendly. They look friendly.
Sam: Let's try reasoning with them. Whoa! That's not bad
Felicia: I'm not going to go last this time! (gasps)
Sam: There's a lot of gasping going on.
Felicia: It's not horrible but it's not (sharp gasp).
Matt: All right, so.
Sam: Wait, does Travis not--
Matt: Roll for Grog.
Laura: Roll for Grog.
Matt: Roll for Grog's initiative.
Laura: I rolled 18 for me. Oh, that's good. 19 for Grog.
Matt: All right, so we have 25 to 20, anyone?
Taliesin: 28.
Laura: What?!
Sam: He rolled a natural 20.
Taliesin: I rolled another natural 20.
Laura: Those dice are magic.
Taliesin: I sacrificed a small child to these dice.
Matt: So Percy's up first. Anybody else above 20?
Felicia: I rolled a 20, but I have a negative two initiative.
Matt: Okay. 19 or 18?
Laura: 19 for Grog. 18 for Vex.
Matt: And also for Lyra.
Felicia: 18 buddies.
Matt: (chuckling) That's sweet. So 15 to ten?
Sam: 15.
Laura: These are pretty good initiatives.
Mary: 13.
Sam: Hey, then we're all above 13, it's pretty good! This bodes well.
Mary: I have no initiative whatsoever. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that'll do. So at the top of the round as one giant has pulled itself out of the cavern and begins shouting over in Giant about the intruders. The secondary one that comes stalking out of the forest, both of them with these giant axes that are currently held on the side of leather belts (roars) give a bellowing scream and go charging into the fray. At the top of the round, though, Percy is ready. What have you got?
Taliesin: What is that strange orange thing, right here?
Matt: This is actually a tree.
Taliesin: That's a tree. Okay, good. So that's cover?
Matt: Yeah. This rock and these boulders here have some cover, but from a giant who has a very large perspective maybe not as much as you'd think.
Taliesin: Okay, so is there any way I can maybe get some partial cover right over here?
Matt: You could move over this way, yes.
Taliesin: Yeah. So I've got cover from the tree from this one until he moves, but I can see this guy?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: It is Bad News time! I'm going to bust out Bad News and take a shot.
Matt: All right, so. Rip out Bad News, uses one of your attacks, second attack prepares it. You're ready to fire, go ahead and shoot.
Taliesin: All right. They're pretty big, so I'm going to take the negative five to my attack bonus and see what that does. That's a 21.
Matt: 21 will hit.
Taliesin: That's a good shot. Oh yeah! That's 17, 27, plus-- 33 points of damage.
Matt: 33 points of damage? Nice. So you hear this loud, ringing explosion that echoes through this small valley at the base of the mountain, and from out the corner of your eye, it's the first time you've seen this weapon do its wonders. You see a flash of light, a plume of smoke goes up and you see this impossibly fast blast of some projectile go slamming into the shoulder of the giant over here that's currently reaching for a rock. It pushes him back against the wall, which prevents him from falling over and he catches himself. Looks back, and you can see there's a small crater in the armor where a little bit of blood begins to pour out, and a little bit of smoke seems to be pouring out of the impact. (snarls and yells) Gives out a really angry yell. You can see like spittle that begins to shake loose and spray from his mouth out of frustration. That the end of your turn?
Taliesin: That is the end of my turn. Yeah. I am now going, maybe I shouldn't have done that. (laughter)
Felicia: It was very impressive. It was very impressive.
Matt: All right, Grog's up first.
Laura: (Grog voice) Grog--
Sam: (Grog voice) Would like--
Laura: (Grog voice) No, Grog doesn't want to Rage! Grog shouts out in Giant, wait! My giant masters were killed by a white dragon, which we think is here. Will you help us fight him?
Matt: Okay. So as Grog stands there, shouting this out to both sides to the two giants, I want to have Grog go ahead and roll a persuasion check.
Laura: Okay. I am going to use Grog's dice.
Matt: Yes. Let's do this proper. This is customary.
Laura: It is proper. Wait. Okay. That's not his, that is mine.
Taliesin: (Grog voice) I would like to negotiate.
Laura: Okay. Well that is good. He is really happy that I am playing him, because I rolled a one for Grog.
Sam: It might work. (laughter)
Laura: I think I should not-- okay. Wait!
Mary: Doesn't Grog get two actions or no?
Laura: That's his action.
Matt: He is not putting up any aggressive action.
Laura: Does he get advantage, however, because he is speaking Giant and he's in the cold?
Matt: No. (laughter)
Matt: Because you have an entire band of seemingly advancing and armed individuals that are currently stalking towards what appears to be the home of these individuals. So unfortunately no. They seem unfazed, and the one at the back seems almost partially amused at this plea and you can see as he takes his axe and puts it up against his shoulder and runs it across the leather in a very aggressive, intimidating fashion as he stalks forward out of the forest.
Laura: (Grog voice) Can Grog move at all?
Matt: Yeah, would you like Grog to move? It would be easier.
Laura: (Grog voice) Where is he?
Matt: He is right here. He is hard to miss. Where would you like Grog to move? There is a giant rock there.
Laura: He is going to stay there.
Matt: Okay. Grog is going to stay up against the rock. His axe across the front. Right, that ends Grog's turn. Vex, you're up. (laughter)
Laura: A moment of silence for that horrible thing I just witnessed.
Matt: You are over here. You just got up off the ground after being slammed with a boulder, and you have Trinket there.
Laura: I am very hurt. Can I get up? Am I prone?
Matt: In the process you've gotten to your feet as they lurched forward and began shouting at each other about the intruders. So you are on your feet.
Laura: Okay. I am going to cast Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Hunter's Mark. On?
Laura: On the one that took a little damage already. And then I am going to shoot him. All these are for like really large groups of people. I am going to shoot him three times. Can I shoot him three times?
Matt: You have two attacks.
Laura: I'm going to shoot him two times. This was good times. This was fun, you guys. 14 for that. That probably doesn't hit. 14 also doesn't hit the second time. Oh my god! What is happening?! (laughter)
Sam: She just disappeared!
Mary: Vex! Vex, stay with us! Vex!
Matt: So as you get to your feet, you look over your shoulder, you point your finger out and as you squint down, you use your ranger focus to make sure this guy is your quarry, and you take a quick scope of his body parts. You're like, those are the areas that will make him weakest. As you go to pull your arrow, you can feel a kink in your shoulder. The impact of the rock seems to have affected you. You release the first arrow and it's just slightly off mark. The second one you pull back and as you release it, it actually splinters off his shield as he knocks it out of the air.
Laura: I am going to run over to cover. What is that other side?
Matt: That is one of the mountain outcroppings.
Laura: Yeah, I am going to hide in that little thing and go, Trinket hide with me.
Matt: Okay, Trinket moves up. (bear moan) All right, and that's your turn.
Laura: That's all of it.
Matt: (laughs) All right, Lyra, you're up.
Felicia: Okay, I am freaked out right now. These are very large individuals. I have only read about them, and they smell slightly like feet. So I am going to-- that is a stench. That is like an athlete's foot commercial waiting to happen. So I am going to take 10d6 and do Disintegrate.
Matt: Go for it.
Felicia: I mean, it seems excessive, but they're very large men! One, two, three, four, five-- That one, he looks like a bull. In the nether-regions.
Matt: So which one, this one or this one?
Felicia: I don't think I can reach that guy.
Matt: What's the distance on it?
Felicia: Oh boy.
Matt: At your spell sheet.
Felicia: I should've written that down. Disintegrate. Oh, there it is! 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? Yeah, they're both within range.
Felicia: Oh gosh, well I should probably hit the wounded one. That always makes RPG sense, right?
Matt: So for that one, do you have to make an actual spell attack roll?
Felicia: No, I don't. I think it's force damage.
Matt: That's right. You just point at it and he has to roll a saving throw.
Felicia: Oh yay! Look at that! Six! Six! Six!
Sam: Well, don't say that. (laughter)
Matt: All this time trying to fight the stigma of DND, and there we go.
Mary: Talking to my people here!
Felicia: All right. That's 20 plus-- now you're all staring at me! 30, 40 points of damage!
Sam: Whoa!
Matt: That's a total of 40? Plus 40?
Felicia: 40 plus 40.
Matt: Yeah, Disintegrate. And he failed his saving throw.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Felicia: In your anus! That's what she yells, she's like, in your anus!
Matt: So as she shouts, she points her finger out, there's a little poof of arcane energy on her finger, and a tiny, sickly green ray of energy just streaks forth from her finger. The giant looks at it awkwardly, and in the split second it hits him in the front of his chest and suddenly the armor in front of him turns to dust and you can see his flesh beginning to just disappear in front of him (gasps) and suddenly tries to gasp for air, as you see part of its jaw beginning to just turn to sand, and it's actually struggling in a series of pain, and it's still standing, but you can see a large part of its body now is just missing. It looks like it got-- it's almost like a portion of it rotted right before you, but there's no actual necrosis. It's just gone. Flesh is missing from a large part of its body. It looks like it's doing really poorly. It lurches forward, and one of its arms is not working as well and it looks at you with a look of confusion, frustration and "how could you?." It's incredulous in its torturous pain.
Felicia: And I go, (gibberish) in Giant and it's the only thing I know in Giant, and I think it says, you are my foe, and I actually say, my cat is your friend.
Matt: Its head turns even further to the side as the tongue lolls out of where the cheek once was.
Felicia: Take that!
Matt: (chuckles) Its angry white eyes glaring aggressively at you. Do you wish to move, or would you like to stay where you are?
Felicia: Oh, I think I'm going to duck behind that little outcropping I have.
Matt: Over here?
Felicia: Yeah, no, behind that little rock-- oh, where am I? Oh, I'm over there. Yeah, I'm going to get-- oh boy. Just stand there, I'm just too flushed right now. I can't go anywhere. This is too situational for me
Matt: All right. Well, (chuckles) this very unhappy giant is going to reach over with his one good arm, the other one's clutching the axe, it reaches over and grabs another rock off the ground that it can find nearby and (whoosh) flings it at you.
Felicia: I should have moved! (laughter)
Matt: That is a 16. What's your armor class?
Felicia: 13.
Matt: Yeah. You, unable to really move out of the way, you look over and just watch it come toward you as it slowly spins in the air. Time seems to slow as you make no intent to shift out of the way. (whack) It slams into you, physical pain not hitting in as the immediate look of-- the sight of white, your vision is knocked to nothingness briefly. You end up taking--
Mary: No, Lyra, no.
Matt: Okay, you take 32 points of bludgeoning damage.
Felicia: Whoa! That is a very intense amount of damage for a tiny woman. Okay.
Laura: You should avoid those boulders in the future.
Matt: And as soon as you recover from it, your vision clarifies and you're able to see everything before you, and you see that same giant is stalking up, right into your face, with its axe in its bad hand. It switches it into its good hand and rears it up preparing itself for another round. That ends that giant's turn. It's going to go five, six and move in between the two of you. You guys, Zahra and Scanlan, as you see this happening you hear the (heavy steps) heavy footfalls behind you, and you look over your shoulder as the second giant comes up with the shield in one arm. Axe is going to go ahead and giant swing towards the two of you. That is going to be a 19 to hit on you, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Matt: And Zahra, that is going to be a-- that's a 25. All right. (laughter)
Matt: 27 points of slashing damage to you, Scanlan. Ooh. All right. And that is 31 points of slashing damage to you, Zahra. As it just (whack), cleaves through the both of you. You are almost knocked off your feet from the sheer blow. Most of the armor takes the damage but you can feel a heavy bruise, and underneath your armor you can feel a little bit of the blood beginning to soak through from the severe impact. Part of the armor plating might have cut into part of your torso (grunts) but you right yourself there. That ends their turn. That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Hey, question. If I hold a turn, do I hold the whole turn? Can I hold my action but do the bonus action? How does it work?
Matt: You got to take all your turn at once. You can hold your initiative. Meaning you can wait to activate your turn later in the tier, but you can't piecemeal your actions.
Sam: Okay, then I am going to just move. I am going to act. I am going to do things. So I turn to the guy who just hit me, and I am going to cast Dominate Person on him. I will sing some sort of song to dominate him with.
Matt: I will say, Dominate Person is effective against humanoids.
Sam: (gasps) Really?!
Matt: Dominate Monster would be--
Sam: They're not humanoid?
Matt: They are not. They are considered giants. They are a different species. You would know that.
Sam: I would know that. Well, then, I guess I won't do that.
Matt: You turn, and your instinct is there, and you're like, these are a little out of your reach as far as that spell is concerned.
Sam: Okay. (laughter)
Mary: It is a very short show tonight.
Sam: Yeah. Okay, well, then we just die. (laughter)
Matt: You've got options!
Sam: Yeah, no, I have options. I'll be fine. Should I go for the guy who-- I'll do (blows raspberry). I'll cast Lightning Bolt on him. That's always a good go-to.
Matt: So as you fumble with the idea of what spell would work, you release a bolt of lightning up towards it. It streaks into the front of its chest and shoulder area. You can see its muscles tense and shake from the sheer amount of electricity that courses into it. It does not make that saving throw, not with a five. So go ahead and roll your damage.
Sam: Is it six or eight?
Matt: It's 8d6.
Sam: Thank you! Okay. Six, six, four. What is that?
Felicia: Six.
Sam: Oh, really? Oh, that's awesome! Now I lost track. 32.
Matt: 32 points of damage. Nice! So as you release the torrent of electrical energy, it courses through the body and ends up streaking off into the snowy, blizzardy sky behind the giant from the upward angle. It (grunts) shakes from the impact, and then rights itself and looks down at you with a really angry face. You can see as it opens its mouth, this light blue and dark teeth on the bottom of its beard-covered jaw. Mist and steam tend to pour out of its mouth. But not like heated steam, this is like a cold air itself that it seems to emanate from it. Its pale whitish-blue hair, slightly framing its form. Up close, at its sheer size, this is a very intimidating creature, as it just stares down looming over you, now with smoke pouring off its shoulder where you impacted it with the Lightning Bolt. Do you want to do any--
Sam: I would like to inspire our new fellow, Zahra, with a quick little ditty. (singing) Ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so scary, ooh, you so scary. You fighty long time. (laughter)
Matt: All right. So you go ahead and take a d10 inspiration dice. Which means, whenever you have to roll an attack roll or saving throw, you can add a d10 to the result you get if you don't think it's going to make it. You don't roll it now, but you just have it on reserve whenever you want to use it.
Mary: Love it.
Sam: And if I move away from him he'll hit me?
Matt: He'll get an attack of opportunity, yes.
Sam: Can I snuggle between his legs and maybe he'll forget I'm there?
Felicia: He's hung like a horse.
Taliesin: You're going to hit yourself in the head
Mary: Swing on it, man. Swing on it. (laughter)
Mary: Yes! Yes, Scanlan!
Matt: Do you want to try and do that?
Sam: It might anger him? Or it might entice him. (laughter)
Sam: I'll just stay put.
Matt: All right. Zahra, you're up.
Mary: All right, I have a question. Do they understand English?
Matt: You are not aware, actually.
Laura: But he said intruder when we came in.
Matt: You heard him say it in Giant. It was understood by Grog that it was intruder.
Mary: All right. They're both within about 30 feet of me, yes?
Matt: Yes. They're both within 30 feet of you
Mary: All right! I'm going to use one of my skills that I have which it doesn't expel a spell slot and use Awakened Mind and touch them both with telekinesis, and in doing so I shall cast Mass Suggestion, and I shall say to them, you will take us to your enemy, the white dragon, and there we shall slay it together. Then you shall return us here safely, where we shall part as friends bonded forever in the slaying of a common enemy.
Matt: All right. As you're looking out at the two of them, you release this energy, speaking through your mind, reaching out to theirs. What is the DC of your spell? It should be at the top of your spell list, the difficulty class.
Sam: Spell save DC. Top right.
Laura: Spell save DC is a 17.
Matt: 17, all right. So both of them seem to--
Laura: Can you add your inspiration? Add your inspiration!
Matt: Inspiration has to be added to a roll.
Mary: My charisma is added to any spell that I cast.
Matt: Well, that's included with the DC there. So both of them reach up and grab their faces, one with its messed up, partially disintegrated hand and falls back on its back foot and both of them look at the group in confusion. There definitely seems to be some sort of interference with their current actions based on this spell; there is a conflict within them. That's as much as I can tell you right now at the moment. That's your action. Do you want to do anything else? You can still move. You still have a bonus action, if you want
Mary: What do you mean bonus action?
Matt: Your Hex is a bonus action, but that is a spell, as well.
Mary: If I move away from them though...
Laura: He can hit you.
Taliesin: If he's going to hit you. He might not.
Laura: That's true! Your spell might have worked.
Mary: I shall go and protect Scanlan, underneath the legs of that giant.
Matt: So you move in to help defend Scanlan.
Mary: He's so tiny, I love little guys. I always have.
Sam: She's a mother figure.
Matt: All right, so both of them seem to be looking around themselves, slightly confused and taking in some sort of strange circumstance. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to hold my turn.
Matt: Okay, Percy's holding initiative. Grog.
Laura: Should I say, in Giant, (in Grog voice) What say you? Let's fight this bastard. Together.
Matt: All right, they look at Grog, confused. Look at each other again. That's Grog's turn, Vex?
Laura: Seriously? While everybody's having a conversation, I would like to take a healing potion.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and take one of those
Laura: Okay. How much do I take for a superior?
Matt: Superior? Superior is 8d4 plus eight. It's quite a bit.
Laura: It is, so just regular healing potion for now. Which is what, 2d8?
Matt: A regular is 2d4 plus two.
Laura: Yay! That's good.
Matt: Lyra.
Felicia: I'm confused. But I do not feel good; I might throw up. So I'm going to hold my turn to see what happens.
Matt: Go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Felicia: Oh, good.
Sam: Oh, for the barf.
Felicia: Oh, it's a five! Constitution five. It's a ten.
Matt: You covertly do your best to not reveal to the entire group that you make a little greenish-brown snow. (laughter)
Matt: It is the most adorable barfing sound you guys have ever heard, though. The combination of the stress and the smell, it's been a harrowing experience for Lyra in these past few minutes. At this point in time, as it comes to the giants' turn. The one who is messed up looks over to the other and (sighs) puts the axe into his belt loop, and the other also one puts its axe in the belt loop, and they glare at the rest of the group, and say in Giant, (gibberish). And any of you speak Giant? Or just Grog.
Laura: Grog.
Matt: Grog translates. Essentially, they say, "We will take you but it is at your own folly."
Laura: (in Grog voice) They'll take us, but it is at our own folly.
Sam: Take us as in-- Grog, can you ask them, take us as in lead us or on their back?
Laura: (strangled gibberish) Which translates to, take us as in lead us or carry us on your back?
Matt: They both chuckle to themselves, and they start walking in towards the cavern.
Laura: Wait! Can we rest a little before we go fight this thing so we can get spell slots back and heal?
Matt: That's up to you guys.
Laura: Can we? Yes! Yes!
Felicia: Up to 24 hours. This one lasts the whole day. Yeah, can we?
Matt: It lasts for 24 hours.
Mary: Mass Suggestion lasts for 24 hours.
Sam: Oh, that is good information.
Mary: Oh and very important  none of us can damage these two giants. Anything else can, we're fine, but should any of us damage it, the spell is poof.
Laura: Are they going to fight with us? Grog? Will you ask them if they're going to fight with us? (gibberish)
Matt: How does it go, again?
Laura: (repeats previous gibberish)
Matt: Right. One of them looks over the shoulder as it's walking into the cavern and puts its hand on the top and leans over and its voice, and I will say from this point forth it is translated to make it easier.
Sam: Just like in Hunt for Red October?
Matt: Yeah basically. "We take you but that is as much as you get. The rest is your own choice. Perhaps the dragon will eat you. That'll keep it satiated for a while." It steps inside the cavern.
Laura: (Grog voice) I think that's a no.
Felicia: Yeah. And I say (speaks gibberish). My cat is your friend!
Taliesin: Bless you!
Matt: (laughs) As you say that, one walks inside. The one that you partially disintegrated earlier steps out and goes, (spitting noise) and spits a-- what in midair looks like liquid and then (shattering) shatters into almost like crystalline ice as it hits the ground on a rock.
Felicia: It is just rude. He smells so much like feet.
Sam: We'll Mass Suggest that they take a bath later.
Taliesin: Let's take a breather. For a moment, collect ourselves.
Laura: I wish I wouldn't have wasted a healing potion just then because we can take some--
Felicia: We can heal our 1d6 plus three.
Matt: So as you guys step inside the cavern. You guys are taking a short rest, currently?
Sam: Short rest.
Matt: All right, so the giants are just sitting there waiting, arms crossed against the wall, talking quietly to each other as the rest of you sit down and bandage your wounds. You tend to your adrenaline as it slowly wears off and suddenly the pain starts to set in from some of the wounds you've taken. So you guys can use as many hit dice as you want to heal yourselves.
Mary: So what do I do?
Laura: You roll a d8. You can roll up to 11d8, plus two for each time.
Sam: Hey, DM.
Matt: Yes?
Sam: How many hit points do I have?
Matt: You haven't taken damage at this point.
Sam: Have they increased at all?
Matt: That is true. You leveled up after the last one. So with this short rest I will say go ahead and roll an additional-- for a bard I think it is a d8, correct?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: What's your hit dice number?
Sam: d8.
Matt: And what's your constitution?
Sam: 15. Plus two.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll a d8 plus two to it
Sam: Four.
Matt: All right, so you add four hit points to your total hit point maximum. Welcome to level 11, Scanlan. (cheering and singing Super Mario victory ditty)
Matt: You also get access to your first 6th-level spell.
Mary: What!?
Laura: What? Get some stuff before we fight a dragon, yo.
Sam: I got it already. I am ready to rock.
Matt: Good. Good choice. You take the next half an hour or so to rest up. You still used your Disintegrate. You need to do a whole night's rest to get that back.
Felicia: Oh! I don't get it? It's six spell levels.
Matt: It is six spell levels you can get back on a short rest?
Felicia: Short rest. Recover six spell levels because I have arcane recovery. So I can actually get that back
Matt: (singing) Wizards are awesome!
Laura: (Grog voice) Grog would like to take his Chain of Returning off of one of the axes he had it on and put onto the Firebrand Warhammer that he took off of that dwarf in Kraghammer.
Matt: All righty, I like it.
Laura: The mean guy he took it off.
Matt: Off of, that was King Murghol, I think, wasn't it? The duergar king you fought in the Underdark.
Mary: I have a question. So I rolled to get my health back and I got more hit points than I had before--
Matt: You can't go more than your maximum. You're at full hit points now.
Taliesin: I want to borrow Grog for just a second and ask these two if they've encountered the dragon before, and what its disposition is. Anything we should know.
Matt: I want you to go ahead, and I will say through Grog-- this is going to be interesting. Since Grog is translating, I'm going to go ahead and have you roll a persuasion check.
Felicia: Wrong dice! Why did you use that dice?
Taliesin: I was feeling weak. Ten.
Matt: Ten. And I want you to roll a persuasion check for Grog with disadvantage.
Laura: Great. Oh, that was a good roll, come on also good roll.
Felicia: It wasn't a good roll. I see a face there.
Taliesin: It was a one, wasn't it?
Laura: It was a one.
Matt: All the crits were last week.
Taliesin: This is my fault. This is all my fault.
Felicia: You are a plague. Your good fortune is a plague upon your friends.
Laura: Travis is going to be so pissed when he gets here.
Matt: I know.
Sam: He'll be dead by the time he gets here
Laura: His flight landed. I got a text. His flight has landed. He's on his way.
Matt: Great, awesome. As Grog finishes translating (gibberish) to the giants, the giants chuckle to themselves and the other one says down to him, what he translates for you, the equivalent of, "There's no help here. They killed our people, but we're alive because we serve it. We'll bring you, like we promised, like we brought all the others."
Laura: They serve the dragon?
Felicia: Can we look around? Are there any dragon tips around?
Matt: You took a rest inside the cavern as you just entered the mountain and at this point as you guys step up the giants are leading you further into the cavern.
Mary: May I talk to him, as well?
Matt: You know Giant?
Mary: No, through Grog. I have telekinesis, so can I speak to one of them?
Matt: Well, telekinesis and telepathy are different things.
Mary: Oh, I mean, I have Awakened Mind.
Matt: Oh right. So you can speak directly to their minds
Mary: Yes. Your people have been persecuted for so long, and you have lost so many of the female version of you, and your children, and you serve them now. Do you want to live as slaves?
Matt: "We want to live."
Mary: So to live as a slave is better than--
Matt: "To not live at all?"
Mary: We are offering you the opportunity to stop your servitude. To end it forever.
Matt: (grunts) They keep walking
Laura: What?
Matt: We'll see how this plays out. This is a process here. You guys heavily failed some early persuasion rolls here, they're in a very negative position with you right now.
Laura: Sorry about that.
Felicia: Let's not bring it up again. I love your hair.
Sam: It's really cool.
Matt: So about 200 feet further into this cavern, the tunnel opens up into a gargantuan natural rock chamber, coated in ice crystals across the entirety of the rounded crag in the ceiling. You can see now as the light you're bringing into-- by the way, is anyone bringing a source of light other than the torchlight?
Laura: Yes, Grog lights his blazing axe.
Mary: And I cast Light on my dark dragon staff.
Matt: All right, so between the (whoosh) now the fire that is now burning off of the warhammer and your Light spell, you can see as you enter following these giants, there are definitely the remnants of a village here, a village that was designed on the scale of these giants and while many of these structures still stand, it is eerily quiet as you step inside. As you begin to step further into the center of this cavern, you see many of these structures have been smashed and destroyed and there is a layer of ice and snow that has been carried in from various blizzard winds or just the internal temperature in this room. And the room is extremely cold. With the little bit of light you have, everyone's breath is very clearly visible with each puff into the air around, and you swear that in a few pockets here it is so cold that you can hear the moisture from your breath coalesce and then shatter on the ground. You all bundle up even tighter with your various furs.
Laura: I snuggle very close to Trinket.
Matt: Trinket snuggles very close to you because Trinket, while made for this type of temperature, is still uncomfortably cold, even at this point.
Sam: Did Lyra give me--
Felicia: I did! I gave you my stone. My Transmutation Stone, which helps you resist cold.
Sam: Wow, I feel so warm and cuddly.
Felicia: Well, don't brag about it. Oh my gosh, my mom told me never bring-- well, she's dead, but before she died, she told me if you can't bring one for everybody, don't bring any. So just be quiet about it.
Sam: Okay. I'm sorry. I was just distracted because we're in a dire situation and I miss the love of my life, Pike. I'm sure you can't identify with that.
Felicia: Oh no! I was just thinking the other day, just outside the cavern, if Aldor was here--
Sam: Aldor?
Felicia: Yes! Did I tell you about him?
Sam: A little.
Felicia: He smells like sandalwood and dismissiveness, but that's okay. We'll get over that.
Sam: Well, we have something in common then and thank you for your stone of warmth or whatever it was.
Felicia: It's a cold resistance.
Sam: I'll just call it a stone of warmth.
Matt: There is no character class more dangerous in DND than mother. (laughter)
Matt: Do not have children if you are ever in a fantasy genre or anything. You ain't getting past 30.
Mary: May I again, sorry, use Awakened Mind to ask the giant what happened here?
Matt: As they begin walking through and looking about, one of them starts giving you these images, and it's less of a language and it's more of a series of memories. And you see visions of a time not long ago. Months, even years. This relatively thriving village of frost giants that had essentially claimed this mountain as their own for generations. Hunting in the nearby Vesper Timberland, occasionally harrowing the traveling merchant band heading up the Glasswalk Path or various other entities that live in this forest. They're not by any means a good people. They exist and they take what they want, but it appears that not long ago this dragon decided that it wanted to live here instead. And you see visions of it stalking through the tunnels, carving its way through the ice and ambushing this frost giant village. You see visions of it tearing into families of them and freezing them on the spot, which is interesting because you see, these giants seem pretty well-adapted to ice and cold weather. It seems it is less of a freezing them physically and more of locking them into place. And as you see these visions, you begin to step further into this village and you can see there are spires, large spires of crystallized ice, and loosely within the shadows of the ice you can see what looks like the suffocated forms of frost giants that are locked in that position under many feet of ice. You see most of this village brought to its knees and destroyed, murdered, eaten, or imprisoned and these two, essentially chosen to survive and given the order to bring what this creature wants.
Mary: There's only two of you left?
Matt: You get this sense of sadness and fear, but also a sense of a lack of any other option.
Mary: Oh, how I wish we could release you from these bonds.
Laura: Is there a way to, like, melt the spires? (whispers) I interrupted you.
Mary: To release them.
Felicia: They are dead in there though, right?
Mary: No, I know but at least maybe they could-- Do you have some burial ritual or anything that you would like to or do these stand as a painful remembrance for you?
Matt: There is a moment where it seems almost like it's going to answer, and then the mind closes off suddenly. There is a defensiveness and these entities, you get the sense that even this tenuous relationship you have built with them is based purely on arcane persuasion, and the more you pry, the more you begin to test the boundaries of what you have done. Pick and choose your words very carefully.
Mary: Zahra sheds a tear, which freezes instantly on her face, and her internal flame melts it off.
Laura: That's pretty badass.
Matt: As you continue to walk, you can see the center of this village is completely in tatters. A lot of the wood and the dried brush and the furs and thick leathers that these giants had gathered and constructed their civilization out of is all just shattered and rended to the floor and then frozen over, left in this weird picturesque, almost a tapestry. A frozen moment in time of utter desolation. Actually, I want you to all to roll a perception check, if you could.
Taliesin: 17.
Felicia: 14.
Sam: 20.
Laura: Oh! No we're not in-- 14.
Mary: Uno.
Matt: Wow, getting the ones out. So as you guys are walking forward, Scanlan, you notice that there is, just outside the light perception stepping forward, a lot of the rubble has been pushed and coalesced into a central monolith. Almost like a 25, 30 foot sculpture of chaos. All of these things have been matted together with what looks like mud and refuse, and as you guys begin to notice this, too, you catch the framing of the light on it and it seems to be built into almost an altar or a large sculpture of worship of a winged dragon creature that is currently in the process of swooping down. You get the sensation that this was built as, essentially, a place of offering to this white dragon, and hopefully a symbol to keep themselves alive and to prove their fealty to this entity.
Felicia: I have a spell called Legend Lore. Can I cast that on white dragon?
Matt: Let's see what Legend Lore does.
Felicia: The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named: current tales, forgotten stories, secret lore that has never been widely known. If it is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. Would I think that this is a legendary dragon?
Matt: Okay. As you take a moment and everyone stops to look around, you notice that Lyra is sitting there currently muttering to herself and putting her fingers through the air, and you can see these small arcane sigils begin to flash in the air where she places her hands, at which point her eyes glaze over with this shimmering gold energy and she seems to go into a trance. Now, what you first are hit with is the image of darkness, black and struggle, a struggle to push, a struggle to exist, a struggle to survive, and then suddenly light. You see the cracking of something releasing, and from there pulling forth from this singular egg, the only one left of its clutch, a white dragon wyrmling pulling itself out of the egg. This, you immediately sense, is the dragon that now resides within this mountain. You begin to see flashes in time of it struggling to survive in the frozen tundra to the north, desperately trying to escape poachers and individuals trying to hunt it, whether to protect their own villages or to use its physical body parts in some sort of sale. You get the sense that at one point it was already the target of some contract that failed. For a brief second, you see a flash of a frozen cavern recently, and a few individuals locked in an icy prison bitten down on and shattered before it cuts to black again. You begin to see moments of this dragon growing, and with each stage in its physical transformation towards becoming a full-fledged adult dragon there is just spite, there is anger, there is ego, there is a severe sense of self-importance, a lust for others to bow before, serve, or feed it. And you have heard and you have read many things about dragons and you have heard things of great intelligence and articulate entities that even, good or evil themselves, have this extremely intelligent presence. This dragon is far more feral and bestial than anything you've read about. It has an intelligence, but it seems to not be concerned with the intricacies of conversation as much as it is to bend everything to its will and to give (voices deepens) to me. (normally) And the one thing that catches your mind before the spell ends is the name that it finally came upon itself, the name that it heard whispered as one of its would-be hunters was suddenly--
Sam: Jeff. (laughter)
Matt: Jeff the dragon. The name Rimefang rings through your mind.
Felicia: His name is Rimefang.
Matt: The two frost giants stop their walking and turn. "Rimefang." They nod and look up to the giant structure they constructed.
Felicia: Oh wow! Can I make a history to sww if I know anyone in the guild who has been named Rimefang?
Matt: Make a history check on this.
Felicia: It's a 21.
Matt: Okay, Rimefang, you gather, is the name of the dragon proper. And there's another drink for you guys out there. They made fun of me for using the word proper.
Sam: Drink!
Matt: This dragon took the name Rimefang. Because in a lot of dragons as they evolve and begin to really create a lair, they really make themselves known publicly and really draw the fear out once they feel they're in a comfortable position. You feel this dragon is just starting to get to that point where it's eager to drive fear into the local populace. From your history check, you do know that there is, somewhere in the books you've gone through, a similar contract, nothing Rimefang related, but there was a white dragon that was supposedly hunted about eight, nine months back, and the team never returned. And you begin to think, "Wait, so if a team of really practiced people never returned from this contract, and we were sent on this as an entry level..."
Felicia: Hey, guys? I have a suspicion that maybe the guild didn't want us to succeed. And I don't want to panic anybody. I just don't think Vanessa--
Mary: Lyra, do you have any enemies in the guild?
Felicia: Well. Everyone seems to be very-- I make a very good soup and I help people with their laundry sometimes and--
Laura: Oh, are you like an assistant?
Felicia: No, I'm a guild member, I just like to be helpful. Like you guys.
Laura: I was just wondering.
Felicia: Well, they just don't send me anywhere. It's a paperwork thing.
Mary: If you don't mind my asking because I do respect you so much, how did your captainship of our crew come about?
Felicia: Well, I got a missive, I got a scroll in my room and the first assignment. I mean, it was very exciting to me and they haven't really paid attention to me. Mertin is very nice to me but Vanessa-- she just has her days, and I've been asking her for so long, and finally I got my assignment. I was hoping Aldor would be here, but he isn't, and that's fine. It'll be the next one. But there may not be a next one, guys. That's what I'm saying.
Mary: Oh, were you Vanessa's assistant? I mean, before you were a member?
Felicia: No. Aldor. I'm here with Aldor, remember?
Sam: If you think we've been sent on some sort of suicide mission--
Felicia: Oh, that's good, the way you put it there!
Sam: Well, I'm a master of words. Should we abandon all hope and just flee? Is that what you're suggesting as our leader? Or should we carry it through and prove everyone wrong?
Felicia: If we abandon this quest, then we never-- I could get kicked out of the guild, for one.
Laura: What happens if the contract that we magically signed doesn't ever come to fruition?
Felicia: It's not good. Let me think.
Sam: You know what? Retrace your steps.
Matt: There you go. In Memento fashion, all these things flash through. If a contract is broken, one: if you're a member of the guild, you're kicked out of the guild. Two: you guys are on this essentially as a trial basis to prevent being arrested and put on trial for breaking the laws of the city of Vasselheim and essentially hunting creatures that aren't sanctified. Or you yourself have not been sanctified to kill, which goes against guild rules and the city itself. Which means if you were to not succeed at the contract, you would probably be put on trial at the seat of judgment.
Laura: Percy is very good at lawyering.
Taliesin: I am. I lawyer quite well, but the hope is that we wouldn't actually break the contract in the first place, because that's complicated.
Mary: I wasn't part of this band of breaking the law. I'm here to gain entry into this guild.
Felicia: Well, you certainly won't get into the guild if you break the contract.
Mary: No, I completely understand, but I won't be brought to trial. Not that I'm all, "well it's all about me," but I'm serious. That's why I'm here! My motivations are not to save my ass, my motivations are to get into this bloody guild!
Taliesin: We're not here based on other people's expectations. We're here because we thought we could handle this and nothing has changed. This changes nothing!
Laura: We are very capable fighters!
Mary: I've seen this. You have proven yourselves already. Those orcs didn't stand a bloody chance.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Felicia: So we go?
Sam: We go. Well actually, Grog-- could someone ask Ace and Gary if we're there or if we have further to travel?
Felicia: We'll just keep going.
Matt: As Grog mentions this, you guys have moved past most of the village, and you've gone towards the back of this large chamber, and you do see what appears to be a tunnel that ascends upwards, deeper into the mountain proper. See, did it again. It's made me all self-conscious. But the entrance is entirely frozen. There is a wall of solid ice between yourselves and the continuation of this tunnel.
Laura: (Grog voice) How thick is it?
Matt: It's hard to see how thick it is from this side.
Laura: (Grog voice) Can Grog run at it and try to bash it really fast?
Matt: So as you guys step up, Grog runs ahead of the rest of the giants and goes as hard as he can towards this. (laughs) So swinging with the axe towards the ice. Go ahead and make an attack roll.
Laura: It's a hammer, which I feel would be better against ice.
Matt: This giant flaming warhammer from King Murghol.
Laura: I feel like every dice is betraying me.
Taliesin: Would you like to use mine?
Laura: No, I'm going to curse yours.
Matt: No, turn it around. Shake the Wil Wheaton curse.
Laura: I'll just leave it at that. It slipped out of my hands, but I'm going to keep it. 15 plus what, eight? Plus nine?
Matt: Plus nine. That'll definitely hit. Go ahead and roll damage for that.
Laura: Okay. Here we go.
Sam: I hope he can hit a wall.
Laura: I don't know, with my ones as of late. Oh, that's just ten.
Matt: Ten damage? Including the fire damage?
Laura: Oh, yes, right. 13.
Matt: 13 damage. (whack) The warhammer streaks through, the light causing this interesting shifting of the radius around it. As it smacks into the ice with this resounding (thwack) sound, the ice shakes and shimmers. A giant crack forms up the front of it, and you can see as he (grunts) pulls it out, the wall itself seems to have largely crumbled in the small space there and looks very fragile. But it's definitely left an impact on the wall.
Taliesin: I can make an attempt at this. I'm going to walk over and study the shattering position and see if I can find the weak point in the wall.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Seven. Getting it all out of my system now.
Matt: The ice wall itself is not a specific architectural structure. It is made of some sort of blasting of ice that froze the air in that way, so it doesn't have any real geometric positioning, but the ice structure itself, you're unable to make out what would be a weak point or not, other than the place of impact where Grog placed the hammer.
Taliesin: I'm going to take a musket ball, go over to the very center of the crack.
Laura: Should we keep a little more quiet than that?
Felicia: Can I use a Fire Bolt? That would be good, a Fire Bolt.
Taliesin: Let's save the Fire Bolt.
Felicia: No, it's a cantrip. Is that okay?
Taliesin: I'm backing up.
Felicia: I'm the leader. I'm going to say I'm going to.
Taliesin: She said, Fire Bolt. I backed away.
Felicia: And that is 1d8 fire damage, which is seven. Seven fire damage.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll to see if you hit with it. So roll and add your spell attack modifier.
Felicia: What is that? Oh, it's 12... plus 11. So that is 23.
Matt: All right, that definitely hits. How much damage? That was seven fire damage, you said?
Felicia: Oh, it's 3d10 fire. Sorry. Because of my level. Which is seven and five and seven is 19.
Matt: Clutching your staff at one side, the book's under your shoulder, you bring your hand out and withdraw your hand with the force of the blast of the Fire Bolt going forward. As it smacks into the section where Grog had slammed the hammer, (boof) it bursts as a flash of arcane reddish fiery energy, and the wall itself shatters inward and starts falling and crumbling nearby. Now, this tall wall, which was about 25 feet tall, begins to fall in giant chunks.
Felicia: (yelps) Sorry!
Matt: I'm going to go ahead and have Lyra and Percy and Grog all make dexterity saving throws.
Felicia: Oh, I'm so good at that, with the negatives. Oh!
Laura: 19!
Taliesin: I can't use acrobatics?
Matt: No, not for this.
Laura: 21 for Grog.
Felicia: I rolled a zero, because I've got a negative two. It's not even on the dice!
Matt: Percy?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: All right, so.
Felicia: Is that worse than a critical fail?
Matt: As the whole wall just (shattering noise) breaking and falling down around you, you all go rushing backward. Grog, strangely and unexpectedly, shoulder-rolls out of the way, epic Geordi La Forge style. Escapes the crumbling wall. Unfortunately, though, Lyra and Percy stumble backward, slipping on the ice that's actually coated the floor of this cavern, and get impacted with part of the fall. It's not too bad, but both of you suffer 14 points of cold damage and bludgeoning. Cold and bludgeoning, as the wall comes tumbling down on you. However, the rest of the cavern now lies open with pieces of jagged ice almost like a broken glass window itself framing the exterior of this tunnel.
Felicia: I'm not going to go to the front anymore, guys.
Sam: Well, you're the leader, shouldn't you be--
Laura: We should protect her. She should be towards the back.
Taliesin: I'm going to heal really quickly.
Matt: Take another short rest?
Laura: We should take a short rest so that we're going in, you know.
Felicia: Yeah. I had scoliosis as a child. I'm not nimble. It's funny.
Mary: Before we take a short rest may I, again, use Awakened Mind, just to see how far away we are.
Matt: You get an image of a slowly ascending and spiraling tunnel that ascends towards an upper cavern at the top of the mountain. The upper cavern you only get a few glimpses of as they themselves have only had a few glimpses of it, but it appears this is not the only obstacle in the way.
Mary: Oh, good.
Sam: Let's carry on then.
Laura: Could you see when you were looking into their mind if it is open or if it is just a big cavern?
Mary: I could not see.
Matt: From the best vantage point you could see, it was a chamber about, I'd say 80 to 85 feet to the ceiling, lined with jagged ice crystals that are coalesced in a temperature so cold that it's almost like the inside of a geode, but it's all made of ice. But you see multiple platforms that are risen in the walls of this, and in the center, there is a singular platform, and there sitting on the top of it is apparently the dragon quarry you seek. And then the image shuts itself out, as one of them glances over the shoulder. It's growing uncomfortable with sharing information.
Mary: Got it. I thank him in my mind.
Matt: All right. Pressing forward, you can see one giant still dragging itself forward with a portion of its physical body essentially gutted.
Mary: What if we gave him a half healing potion?
Sam: Don't mess with the magic.
Laura: Because, here's the thing. If they fight with us, it's great, but if they turn on us then we are going to have to fight them at full power again.
Mary: Yeah, but we have 24 hours.
Sam: Yes, but the healing potion might do something. Let's just keep going. You are a very kind soul.
Matt: So are you guys taking a short rest to heal up? Okay. If you haven't already rolled your dice-- You healed up now? Perfect. All right, so as you guys continue to trudge up this extremely cold-- let me see. I think it'll be a fun one to-- There we go. You guys continue to ascend up this pitch-black cavern here. It appears that both the giants and the dragon do not need light to make their way through this cavern structure. So you are the small beads of visual lightness in the entire structure. The floor itself is slick, and there are bits of rough rock that you can find foot purchase but there are a few moments where some of you slip and you lose about ten feet and then catch yourself and have to move upward with this slight 35-degree incline, slowly spiraling upward. You push forward for about 30 minutes or so in this long, seemingly-- for lack of a better term, there isn't a lot of changed variation to it; it's just a gradual spiral in itself.
Laura: I want to keep perception out to make sure that nothing is ahead of us.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a perception check.
Laura: Okay, but this is pertaining to dragons. He is one of my favored enemies, so I have additional bonuses to tracking him and insight against him. Favored enemies!
Matt: All right. So you're perceiving anything dragon-related and things that would be a forewarning of a dragon, okay.
Laura: Things he would have laid down for us. Stuff like that.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll again. You have an advantage.
Laura: You know, just to see. Okay. 18?
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, you do see there are claw marks along the walls, you can see where portions of this cavern were carved out by the claws of Rimefang. You can see that occasionally there are pieces of frozen rock that are solid ice, some that appear to be an unthawed chunk of flesh of some kind. As you push further up this cavern, you spot what looks like the lower half of a statue.
Felicia: Ugh. That's a-- oh my god.
Taliesin: That's unpleasant.
Laura: Half of a giant, right?
Matt: This appears to be a frost giant that met its end. The actual lower half of the torso itself is giving off a stench of slowly rotting flesh. There is ice encasing the lower half of it. It's interesting because the physical form of the frost giants resist cold naturally, and this temperature would normally freeze any other flesh completely solid. Here, it naturally decays. But there is a distinct place where the torso was removed forcibly by what looks like a series of daggers and/or dragon's teeth.
Felicia: I have little ginger chews, if anybody wants one.
Taliesin: I'll take one.
Felicia: Here you go. Thank you. Just in my little pack here.
Matt: About ten more minutes of walking, you come upon another frozen wall barrier.
Sam: I will check it for traps!
Matt: Go ahead and roll perception.
Laura: (laughs) Thanks, brother.
Sam: Five.
Matt: As far as you can tell, it is a frost/snow-covered ground with walls and a ceiling.
Sam: Everyone. There are definitely no traps here.
Laura: Oh, good. Maybe we should stay back?
Felicia: Maybe I could do the Fire Bolt from afar. That's a good idea, and a leader idea that I had that you just reminded me of.
Laura: Good thinking, Lyra.
Felicia: Thank you. Oh, that definitely hits. That's 28.
Matt: 28. Go ahead and roll damage.
Felicia: It's a nine and a ten and five. 24.
Matt: 24. So as you focus, close one eye, and aim, you release a secondary Fire Bolt. (boosh) It slams into the front of the wall of ice, which immediately bursts inside. Shattered shards of glass-like ice go flying further up the cavern. The rest of it falls and collapses at a distance, (crashing) around you. Thankfully, you're all far enough away where there isn't an issue, and the wall seems to have shattered.
Felicia: That's the way you do it! Thank you. Oh my gosh, you guys.
Laura: Before we move forward, I've studied dragons a lot. I just want to say. So obviously we all know they're susceptible to fire damage, yes? This is an ice-breathing bastard. Do as much fire attacks as we can.
Mary: Yes. Don't dragons love, especially white ones, shiny, sparkly things? Especially gems, from what I've gleaned over the years.
Laura: If he could be distracted during combat, maybe.
Felicia: A very aggressive person. I got a glimpse of his attitude, and it is not pleasant.
Laura: Not happy.
Felicia: No. He is full of bile and vitriol, and he likes to be worshiped. We could pretend to be worshiping him.
Laura: But he'll still want to eat us. But yes, we could do that.
Felicia: I mean, he didn't eat these two guys!
Laura: It might be something to think about.
Felicia: At least to get close to him.
Laura: Before we spring an attack, yes.
Matt: Go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Laura: With advantage because it's pertaining to dragons?
Sam: (laughs) She's a stickler.
Laura: Is that an insight check?
Matt: That's just adding your intelligence modifier.
Laura: Okay, let me see what that-- oh, that's Grog's. What am I doing? Okay, so 20 was the first roll. 20 is the high roll. Oh, wait! No! 22.
Matt: 22. Okay. A few things you do know about dragons, specifically a white dragon, from your studying. You lost someone very important to you, supposedly to a dragon, and so you've spent a lot of your life focused on their techniques, their abilities, how they work. White dragons, you know, have complete immunity to cold. Cold damage of all sorts has no effect on them whatsoever. You know that they have capability of flight. They surround themselves with ice but are not hindered by it whatsoever. You do know that their claws and teeth are extremely dangerous. They themselves also, using their wings and tail, become a fierce entity from all sides. Its cold breath is extremely dangerous. It can affect a large area, and even its presence is frightful enough to where some of the most seasoned adventurers go running, fleeing, or cowering in a corner. Let alone encountering one in its lair, itself, it already has an advantage, as it sets an environment to put it at its advantage. So anything and everything you can do to prepare and be ready for such an encounter would be highly recommended. You do get the sensation that even though they are cold-based, fire doesn't necessarily do any additional damage, but it is not reduced or able to resist it.
Laura: It can't resist fire. What about lightning damage? Do I know anything about that?
Matt: Best that you know, most magics and other types of damage other than cold have an effect on it, though it does have unnatural resilience to spells and things for a large part of the combat.
Felicia: I can cast Stoneskin on one person. Or up to, actually-- I could cast Stoneskin up to three times.
Matt: But it's a concentration spell, so you can only have it up on one person.
Felicia: I can only have it on one person at a time. So who would be most likely to resist slashing and bludgeoning and piercing?
Laura: Probably Grog. He's going to be the one that's going to be up close, out of all of us.
Matt: As Grog says, "That's all right. If I'm raging, I already have the ability to resist."
Laura: That's true. He takes half to piercing and slashing.
Felicia: Oh, okay. So then we need the other person who might be within range.
Taliesin: Trinket.
Laura: Trinket.
Mary: Trinket.
Sam: Trinket's here? (laughter)
Matt: As you look over. (sad bear moan)
Laura: Trinket's right there, Scanlan.
Felicia: I don't want to demean him, but his performance is--
Laura: Lyra!
Felicia: I love him. Of course he gets the spell.
Laura: He is really, really cool!
Sam: He does things!
Felicia: Yes, of course, I don't know what I was thinking.
Laura: Here's the thing. If he doesn't have Stoneskin, I probably won't let him charge.
Taliesin: But if he does have Stoneskin, will you let him charge?
Laura: Probably.
Felicia: All right, well, that could be another-- Does that seem like a good idea for a bear?
Mary: Scanlan, are most of your attacks up close or are they far?
Sam: I've got a wide range. I like to keep people guessing. It's my thing.
Felicia: But we wouldn't really want you within claw damage.
Sam: I wouldn't want that, either.
Felicia: It does make more-- I don't mean to demean Trinket, he is a lovely bear.
Sam: Of all the bears I've known, he's top five. Top five.
Matt: As you're saying this, Trinket senses the conversation and plants both feet in the ground (growls).
Laura: See how tough he is?
Matt: He seems to be showing off. And for a moment, even though it's a conversation, that's a dangerous-looking bear.
Mary: I use Beast Speak on Trinket. And say, Trinket, what are you feeling right now? What's going on? You seem very excited.
Matt: Okay, you notice Zahra leans forward and starts giving this series of low, guttural sounds. It's weird. There's this weird arcane interference and this strange, almost like the sound itself is being muffled and stretched. And Trinket turns to her and starts giving the same noises back. Trinket says to you, essentially, "I'll do whatever it takes to protect my Vex. If this creature tries anything, I will tear its throat from its head."
Felicia: He's a sexier bear than I thought he was.
Laura: And he gives good massages, Lyra.
Felicia: Okay. So I will cast Stoneskin. It lasts an hour, so I'll cast it within the perimeter that we think we're going to get hit.
Laura: Tell him that I love him very much!
Mary: I also want to tell you, Trinket. First of all, boy or girl? Just have to check.
Laura: He's a boy! Look at his giant dick.
Matt: He leans back in a sitting bear position.
Mary: Thank you, I needed some inspiration for this fight we're about to do. All right. I also want you to know that Vex loves you very much and will do whatever she can to protect you.
Matt: As this guttural conversation comes forth, Trinket comes up to you and nuzzles his nose up against your side.
Laura: Oh, little buddy!
Felicia: I wish Aldor would do that to me.
Sam: Show his giant cock to you? (laughter)
Mary: Show his giant cock to you? (laughter)
Felicia: I saw it once. It was glorious.
Mary: Very inspiring.
Matt: As Lyra's in this memory trance, finishes casting Stoneskin and reaches out and touches Trinket. You can see Trinket's physical form, all the fur seems to coalesce into a thick rock-type exterior shell of magical protection.
Laura: What does his armor class raise by?
Matt: Armor class doesn't change, but all damage that Trinket takes from bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing is reduced by half.
Laura: Nice.
Mary: Thank you, Trinket, lovely to talk to you.
Sam: What else can we do to prepare?
Laura: I promise, Lyra, I will let him attack this battle.
Felicia: Oh good, no, it's fantastic. That invited so many good thoughts in my mind. I don't mind anything at this point. I mean, what?
Matt: The giants begin to move forward into the cavern.
Laura: It's happening.
Mary: Yep. Screw your courage to the sticking-place.
Taliesin: Ew. Oh. All right.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, I want you to go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Oh boy, already? Dex. 17. Oh. Plus four. 21.
Matt: 21. As you begin stepping forward up the cavern where the wall itself has collapsed, you step forward onto a part of the ice that is far more brittle than you expected, and suddenly it (cracks) breaks beneath your foot.
Sam: My Scanlan-sense is tingling!
Matt: You push off and fall onto your back, and as you guys look over, you hear the cracking and the falling of some sort of stone or ice-like structure. You see where Scanlan was stepping a ten-foot-diameter pit crumbles and falls beneath. And peering over the inside and using your light, you can see there appears to be an arrangement of razor-sharp ice spikes gathered at the bottom of a 15-foot pit.
Laura: What? Why isn't my brother here? I need to check for traps from now on. Snoop ahead.
Taliesin: I think we've found one. There's a trap right there.
Sam: Does that take up our whole path now?
Matt: The tunnel itself is about 20 feet wide at this point, so you guys can move around it. The giants were ahead of you at this point.
Sam: Did they laugh?
Matt: One of them shakes his head and the other one just keeps walking.
Felicia: Gee, I had a spell that would be useful, but it's not ready.
Sam: Thanks for that update.
Felicia: I'm just being honest. I could've lied, said that I totally prepared that spell, but I could've been knowing Giant the whole time, so I just.
Laura: (laughs) Oops.
Felicia: If anybody falls, I can make them fall gently. That's on the list.
Laura: Oh, that's good. Is that Feather Fall? Nice. Okay, I perceive some more and see if I see any traps ahead of us the whole time.
Matt: All right. You go ahead and make a perception check as you move forward.
Laura: That would be a seven. 15.
Matt: 15, okay. You guys continue to push upwards this long spiraling corridor. You reach another ice wall that has already been partially broken from some sort of encounter long ago. You immediately see that the part of the wall that is broken. There's about a ten-foot-wide blocked passage, the entirety of that walkway appears to be another trap, and the giants are waiting back.
Laura: Good for you. There's a thing here. We should not step on it. I have one job on this ship!
Mary: I know it's stupid, but goddamn it, I'm going to do it.
Sam: How do we get around? What do we do?
Laura: We should maybe break down this ice wall and then not walk on this area. How about that?
Sam: Oh. Okay. Let's, yes.
Felicia: Oh, good. Should I Firebolt? I mean, I'm going to Firebolt. From a distance.
Laura: (singing) From a distance, the world is...
Felicia: (singing) From a distance, the world is...
Mary: (singing) From a distance, the world is...
Sam: (singing) From a distance, the world is...
Sam: Beaches.
Felicia: That's a 30.
Matt: 30. Go ahead and roll some damage.
Felicia: Yeah! Nine and eight and a ten, these are good rolls. That's a 27.
Matt: 27. This bolt arcs around from the side. You hit it right at the point where half of the wall had collapsed, causing the other half of the wall to immediately shatter and collapse inward, spraying bits of ice and rock against the wall on that side. The ground becomes rough terrain in that general vicinity, but it's easy enough to traverse over without any serious issue. As you guys step over, and the giants make their way across, stepping over it entirely with their long gait. You move carefully over the shattered wall bits, but the ground itself seems solid. You get past without issue.
Laura: Before we go into the actual lair of the dragon-- once we get to it; I don't know much more of these thingies there are. Do we want to go in as if we're offering it something and saying, hey, we love you, we want to bring you people, and stuff like that?
Mary: We are here to serve you?
Laura: Or do we want to send somebody in first and act like they're here to serve it, and then we all spring in and surprise it? What do you want to do?
Sam: They like to eat giants.
Laura: It wants to eat anything frozen, basically. It freezes things, and then it eats them.
Felicia: Well, there was another party that the guild-- the guild did send another party.
Laura: I don't know if they had a method or if they just walked right in.
Taliesin: Perhaps if we're quiet and stealthy. Can we be quiet and stealthy?
Felicia: I can't!
Mary: I can cast Invisibility.
Felicia: Ooh, I can cast Invisibility on myself.
Sam: That would help.
Mary: So learning of the dragon, will it be able to detect us if we cast Invisibility?
Felicia: That's nature? That would be a nature check or animal handling?
Matt: This would be an intelligence check.
Felicia: Oh. Well, I can do that. That's a 30-- that's a 23.
Matt: Okay, so what you've read of dragons, their ability to sense their surroundings is adapted to all environments, whether they can see or not. They actually have the ability to see with no sight necessary to a certain extent, so invisibility would help at a distance, quite a bit of distance, but within a certain point it is able to sense your presence whether or not it can see you. Also note, if you cast Invisibility you lose your concentration spell on Trinket.
Felicia: Oh, so let's not do that. Now, his vanity, he does like being worshipped. So that is the key.
Sam: So we could go in with an offering.
Laura: An offering. What if we laid a trap in the offering? What if we used your frag grenade that you did. Is it a bomb? Does it set off on a timer? Is it very fragile?
Taliesin: I have to set it off personally. I actually have to shoot it to set it off.
Mary: So smile, you son of a bitch, basically, if we put it in his mouth?
Laura: Do we have any bombs or anything like that? Because I have a very big beautiful diamond of awesomeness that we uncovered before that I keep about. We could present him with this big, huge-ass diamond and then have it trapped with some sort of exploding device.
Sam: We could.
Felicia: If he picks the diamond up off of the--
Laura: We could put it in a bag and then put the diamond on top of a bomb or something, and then when he picks it up and like, (explosion) in his face.
Taliesin: That's hoping for an awful lot of things to go our way. More things than normally go our way, to be fair.
Felicia: Well, it seems worthy of trying to get close to him, because his attacks-- Would he as a dragon have a very good length attack?
Matt: Yeah, as a dragon has some decent reach with some of its attacks. Its bite, and its length of neck and ability to bite actually has quite a bit of reach. Also, its tail has quite some reach, as well. It can cover some decent ground just with its physical form.
Felicia: The thing is, obviously the trolls don't come up here a lot or there wouldn't be so much ice in here. Walls. So I think that's a problem, so it's not as if they come up here all the time to give it treats. Right?
Sam: We could just walk in there. I could be holding Lyra as my captive and say, I've brought you this captive to eat.
Felicia: I don't like that one.
Sam: Well, you know, you're very appealing.
Mary: We still don't know that the giants aren't going to help us.
Matt: As you guys are stepping forward up the pathway, you turn a corner and you can see the giants have stopped, and they have a physical trepidation to the way that they're leaning backward in their stance. As you turn the corner, the little bit of light that reaches out, you can see there appears to be one final ice wall that has a ten-foot opening where it's left as a pathway, and it opens into a darkened chamber.
Mary: Well, I have darkvision for 60 feet, so I could approach around the side and peer in and just see what's there, 60 feet ahead.
Matt: Okay, so you walk up past the giants to this entrance? All right. As you walk forward, you see your vision spill out in the darkness, with a little bit of dim light and the darkness before you reveals itself. You can see a smattering of broken bits along the ground, looks like rocks and ice, a frozen leg of some humanoid, an arm, some scattered, broken armor and weapons. There are pieces of what appears to be a frozen-over graveyard of previous attempts towards inhabiting this room. And as you continue to push forward towards the edge, just towards the perimeter as far as your vision can see at this doorway, you see a central platform in the middle of this giant chamber that rises up about 15 feet. Ten, 15 feet, and just cresting over the top of this platform is the edge of an alabaster snout, with teeth overlapping. You hear this (snarls) growling snarl. And this little voice spills out from underneath and says, "Why don't you enter? If you're going to arrive and present yourselves, do not cower yet."
Felicia: Get that diamond out!
Matt: And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a break. (shouting)
Matt: We're going to take a quick ten-minute break to go ahead and use the bathroom, get a little snack. Yes?
Zac: We're eight subscribers away from another giveaway. (cheering)
Zac: The giveaway includes a signed player's handbook by all your wonderful hosts, as well as the hosts that will be here next week, and a signed copy of Felicia Day's new book.
Felicia: My new book! It's right there! I signed it.
Sam: What's it called? What's the title?
Felicia: It's called You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost).
Sam: Aw. That's cool.
Felicia: It's amusing.
Zac: Are you weird in real life all the time?
Felicia: No, I mean, look at me.
Zac: No. Definitely not.
Felicia: I don't believe your face.
Sam: Did you consider the title Day Dreaming?
Felicia: You're pretty.
Sam: I just thought, because it's like a pun.
Felicia: No, that's awful.
Sam: Consider it.
Matt: Somewhere, someone's holding their manuscript entitled Day Dreaming and going (fake crying). (laughter)
Matt: All right, guys, we'll take a quick break, we'll see you back in ten minutes or so to see how this goes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back from the break! Our fantastic Travis finally made it. (cheering)
Travis: I heard I rolled really well in the beginning of this.
Matt: Yeah, it went wonderfully.
Laura: Sorry. But your Chain of Returning is attached to your blazing warhammer now.
Matt: There you go. So as it ends up, we have a new winner. KadenPhilly is the winner, congratulations, of our next giveaway. So we'll be giving away the player's handbook, the signed photo, a copy of Felicia's book-- yay!-- and a bunch of other goodies coming your way soon, so make sure you get your information to the Overlord. We'll have another giveaway at 5,800, if we can get to there by the end of the show tonight, so let's see if we can hit that. In the meantime, guys--
Travis: Shit.
Mary: Yeah. Welcome to the shit.
Travis: I've been watching in the car.
Matt: You guys have all been making your way through the cavern back here. Zahra has stepped forward and in the darkness, you can see right here at the edge a form.
Felicia: He's up above us, though.
Matt: Yep. About ten, 15 feet up on this platform, leaning over the edge is Rimefang, staring at you through the darkness. A claw comes forward and beckons.
Laura: Can I, from here, before we go in there-- I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.
Matt: You can't see him right now.
Mary: I can.
Matt: Zahra can.
Travis: I can, too. I've got my belt of dwarven darkvision.
Felicia: Is he speaking dragon?
Matt: Speaking Common.
Felicia: He's speaking Common. Okay.
Mary: Would he detect if I would cast anything on him at the moment? I don't know! Then I'm going to sit here and drink my drink.
Travis: Are you offering him that jewel, or did we ditch that idea?
Laura: No, are we doing that?
Sam: We might. Depends what he asks. Yeah, let's do it.
Travis: Yeah, roll it out like a tennis ball for a dog.
Taliesin: Do we have a little bag we can put the jewels in?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: We don't have time to do any of this stuff.
Laura: Yeah, we do.
Taliesin: We have a second. I'm going to hand you my Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch. Why not?
Travis: You can Hold Monster?
Mary: I can Hold Monster. Yeah, we both can.
Travis: Does he qualify as a monster?
Matt: As far as you know, dragon's pretty much a monster.
Laura: I am putting Percy's hand grenade inside this bag along with a diamond. Oh, it's a really pretty diamond.
Taliesin: We'll get it back, it's okay.
Laura: As long as it doesn't explode.
Taliesin: You can't explode a diamond.
Laura: That's true, diamonds are really strong.
Taliesin: Diamonds are forever.
Laura: I put that in the bag. Are we tossing this at him? What are we doing?
Sam: No! We walk in. He's beckoning us. Let's walk in. I'm walking in.
Matt: All right, so you guys all walk in?
Sam: I'm going ahead.
Laura: Here, hold the bag.
Sam: I'll take the bag.
Matt: Zahra, are you staying ahead with Scanlan?
Felicia: I believe that you squishy people should be back here!
Travis: I'm not squishy, I go with them.
Matt: As a note, as you guys are walking through and the light hits the walls, you begin to see the ice itself, which you've become accustomed to, is now being broken up into what looks like little glittering stars. It's almost like you're walking through a frozen area of the night sky. You realize that there are gold pieces frozen in sporadically all throughout the wall, the floor, the ceiling here. The actual, whatever wealth this dragon has acquired is in some way shape or form embedded in its own lair. Anyway. So we have the three of you up front. Who's up next? I imagine we've got Trinket.
Laura: Yeah. Me.
Matt: All right, so you guys all continue to move forward?
Mary: Not too close!
Laura: Scanlan!
Matt: There? Where do you want to stop? You guys have laser pointers to use, by the way, if you want to point out wherever you want to be.
Laura: Scanlan should definitely talk to him.
Taliesin: I would like to go around here.
Felicia: Oh glorious Rimefang, we have an offering for you!
Taliesin: That's not me.
Sam: Is that you? Hello.
Matt: No, that was you, sorry. So Percy goes here.
Laura: Over by Percy. But further.
Felicia: Is that 90 feet?
Sam: It's less than that. We're 30 feet away now.
Laura: Oh, come on, giants. Help us out.
Matt: So as you guys enter the chamber, the actual air here is more still and cold than at any point of the interior of the cavern has been. Even breathing inward hurts in itself as the freezing air hits your lungs. Rimefang sits there, perched on top of this central platform, grinning down towards the rest of the group. You, who have shouted this out, Lyra, about having an offering. Rimefang immediately leans forward. "An offering, you say?"
Laura: I want to make my way further up. While he's talking, I want to make my way along the wall a little.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Laura: Oh no. 20! Natural 20! And all I needed was fried chicken! (laughter)
Travis: It's true.
Matt: All right, so. You, somehow, manage to dart out of the visual reference of a very focused adult white dragon. Rimefang does not seem to gather any movement, and you vanish into the side. Where do you want to go?
Laura: A little bit further. There. That sounds good.
Matt: Okay. Percy, as you're stepping over you realize you're stepping onto what looks like the broken lower half of another giant that has fallen over, a booted leg and part of an eaten armored torso to your back. As you begin to look through, you also see there currently frozen in place three other individuals that are in mid-battle and are frozen solid.
Laura: If we unfreeze them, they could help us.
Felicia: They're probably dead in there.
Travis: We're standing in front of a dragon!
Sam: Rimefang?
Mary: Oh great Rimefang! What a glorious moon you are amidst the stars of your treasure.
Travis: Oh, pour it on, why don't you? (laughter)
Mary: We do have an offering for you.
Sam: Yes. And I use Mage Hand to lift the diamond out of the bag and dangle it in front of the dragon. We've brought you this diamond. We've come from the Slayer's Take. We represent the guild and we are here to formally apologize for sending a few of our members here in the past and promise that we never shall again, and as a gift of apology and hopefully brotherhood, we offer you this diamond. There are many more to come.
Taliesin: And everything else in the bag, as well.
Laura: And then you put it back in the bag. And then you give it to him.
Matt: There's this low, guttural snarl (snarls). It leans forward, sneaking down off the perch a little bit. Its head moves forward and stretches outward, no more than maybe ten feet from your face. You can see it inspecting the diamond as you're holding it by the Mage Hand, floating above the rest of the bag. Chuckles to itself. (chuckles) "This is your measly offering?"
Sam: There is a diamond of much greater size and value in this pouch. But first, we want to hear that you are going to allow us safe passage out of here before we turn it over to you.
Matt: Persuasion check.
Zac: Guys, just so you know, the stream's buffering, so hold. Twitch problems.
Felicia: Oh no.
Zac: Hold for buffer.
Matt: Do we know at what point it started buffering?
Zac: You're back up. Missing the last two sentences. Buffer over.
Sam: Please allow us safe passage. And then you said roll for persuasion, and I rolled a 19.
Matt: Rimefang's head withdraws back and its claws pull back on top of the platform. It lifts its head up, looking down at you with this very disinterested, snooty look (huffs). As it snorts out of its nose, this puff of frost shoots out and crystals of ice fall and clatter to the ground around it.
Sam: That was so cool.
Matt: "You. You trespass into my domain, your voices bickering and bouncing off the walls, annoying me, waking me from my slumber. My freshly eaten slumber. I am curious, before you so walk into my dinner table, why you seem to have gotten past my guardians?" At which point the two giants who are standing behind you look over at each other nervously.
Sam: Your guardians are well aware of our power and position and did not want to offend you by turning us away.
Matt: "Are you to tell me I spared your insignificant lives so you could let this insulting, insufferable insect into the heart of my domain?"
Sam: I'm called Burt Reynolds, and I take great offense at that.
Matt: The dragon's head turns to the side for a moment as a glance of confusion and almost amusement that you speak up to it with such a disrespectful manner. (evil laughter)
Sam: You can call me Mr. Reynolds or simply Burt.
Matt: (heavy impacts) Its claws dig in and tighten on the edges of this platform. You can see the stonework and the ice crack and shatter under its grip as pieces of stone tumble down the edges of the platform, scattering across the ground with a slight clattering. The wings (whoosh) unfurl outward. Its head looks down upon you directly. "Burt." (laughter)
Matt: "You say you're from the Slayer's Take. I have not lived these hundred years or so to become the hunted. I am the hunter! I am the scourge of the Thorain Tundra! I am the stalker of this timberland. Well. Parts of you shall adorn my walls, glittering in pieces for times to come. Giants. To my side! Tonight, you choose whether I dine on you or just them."
Mary: I use-- fuck me. (laughter)
Taliesin: I don't know if you have that spell.
Felicia: Really, what's the DC on that?
Mary: It's very high! I use Awakened Mind to once more say, now we have seen what you have been through. We see the terror that you face every day from this awful beast. This is your chance. You may not have another. Fight him with us and destroy this beast forever.
Matt: Make a persuasion check versus the dragon's intimidation check.
Sam: Oh, versus a dragon!
Laura: Natural 20 all the way. Natural 20. I've had my bow notched, and I cast Hunter's Mark while all this is going on.
Mary: 18. 18 plus what?
Sam: What is it, persuasion?
Matt: Persuasion.
Mary: Plus nine. 27.
Matt: The giants look at each other, and they look down at the rest of you. They pull their axes out, shields at the ready, and look back up at Rimefang, and in Giant you hear, muttered under their breath, "It's now or never." (cheering)
Matt: Roll initiative.
Mary: Yes!
Laura: Oh my god.
Felicia: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Felicia: Oh, I rolled lower!
Laura: I rolled a 20.
Taliesin: I rolled another 20.
Laura: Me too!
Travis: What is it with you and your 20s?
Taliesin: I don't know! I don't know what happened.
Matt: Okay, all right. 25 to 20, anyone?
Laura: 25.
Taliesin: 28.
Mary: What?!
Matt: All right. We have Percy, we have Vex, leaving that up there. All right, we have 20 to 15?
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19, nice. 15 to ten?
Mary: 12.
Matt: 12. Zahra, 12. Ten to five?
Sam: Seven.
Matt: Seven for Scanlan. (laughing) what did you roll?
Felicia: Negative one! (laughter)
Mary: That's our leader!
Matt: Did you roll a natural one?
Felicia: I rolled a one, and I have a negative two.
Travis: On your initiative?!
Felicia: Yes! I'm never going. I'm going to just have a snack.
Travis: You break out the trail mix.
Taliesin: The little gingers come back out.
Felicia: Is that a record?
Travis: That is a record. I don't think we've ever had a negative initiative.
Matt: All right, so as the wings unfurl on top of this platform, the combat round begins with Percy.
Taliesin: If I take one shot, can I hold my second shot until an event? Can I time my second shot?
Matt: No, you'd have to hold your initiative, or you do all your actions in one round, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Darn it. What initiative did you roll, again?
Sam: Low. Second to last.
Taliesin: In that case, I'm going to take a few steps behind that frozen creature right there. I'm going to pull out Bad News.
Mary: (singing) Bad News!
Sam: (singing) Bad News!
Taliesin: (singing) Bad News!
Taliesin: I'm going to aim for the face. I'm going to take a head shot on him.
Matt: Okay, the frozen warrior is in front of you.
Taliesin: I'm just using him as partial cover.
Matt: Okay, so you're behind the creature. Are you just putting it on it to aim?
Taliesin: More or less. I'm using him as a steady and as partial cover as I take a head shot on the dragon. I'm not taking a bonus for damage, no. Oh. 15?
Matt: 15 unfortunately does not hit. As you shoot, (gunshot), it actually hits the body but the hardness of the dragon's scales ricochets the shot off, (ricochet sound), you see it impact on some part of the far side of the cavern.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a bonus action and spend another grit point and do another shot.
Matt: So you're doing your action surge?
Taliesin: I'm taking my action surge.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action surge, and that's it for this round. You use your first round to reload Bad News and place it back up on top.
Taliesin: Come on.
Matt: Another head shot, you said?
Taliesin: Yeah. Oh! 19! That's much better. Plus 12, that's 32 to hit. And that's 15 points of damage, and head shot means he's got disadvantage on all attacks for the next round.
Matt: Okay, good to know. So I'm going to go ahead and roll. All right, so. (gunshot) From the impact of the blast, you see the shot ricochet off of Rimefang's face. The impact sends a couple pieces of white dragon scale shooting off into the darkness, and the head (grunts) rears from the impact, shakes, seemingly loosely shaken by the impact of the blast. The blowback from the gun actually sends a large crack through the physical body of the ice warrior ahead of you, and it collapses into a pile of ice on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: I feel a little guilty about that. I feel very guilty about that.
Matt: You get the feeling that whatever was there probably has not been alive for quite a while.
Taliesin: Okay, I feel a little better.
Matt: Frozen solid. It breaks like the T-1000.
Taliesin: And he was the most useful he's ever been.
Matt: That ends Percy's turn. We're up at Vex.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Lightning Arrow, and I'm going to attack through my Blazing Bow.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Okay. Oh, that's good! That is a 25?
Matt: 25? 25 does hit, yes.
Laura: Okay, so that is 4d8 of lightning damage.
Matt: All right. Saving throw for half? Or just take it?
Laura: Saving throw for half, yes.
Matt: That's a natural 20 on its saving throw, so it takes half damage.
Felicia: That's some stink-eye.
Matt: Hey, better on a saving throw than on an attack.
Laura: 13 plus six is 19, 20, so ten. Plus regular damage, right? For my regular. 19. I know. 11 plus ten is 21, plus Hunter's Mark is four. And then plus my Blazing Bow, which adds another ten. Where did that land? Shit, balls! I'm so aggressive right now! I'm going to roll a different one! Oh my god. That looks like a one. Oh wow. Two ones. That's great.
Matt: So as you pull back your arrow, the actual shaft begins to spark with bluish energy as you release it. The arrow transforms (energy noises) into an arcing bolt of electrical energy. It impacts and courses through the upper torso of the dragon, as it's (grunts) still trying to shake off the damage it took from Percy's attack. It manages to push off most of the impact, but still takes damage from it. There's also a burst of fire from the impact, as well, you can see a bit of flame trickle up the side of his body and it eventually goes out from the cold in the air.
Laura: That was one attack.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: But was the spell an action?
Laura: The Lightning Arrow is a bonus.
Matt: Oh, okay. So it makes your next attack do that. Right. Gotcha. So you have one more attack.
Laura: So I am going to send Trinket. Where is he?
Matt: Trinket's over here with the giants guarding him.
Laura: Dear lord. Can Trinket run around and attack his butt?
Matt: It's actually up on top of a 15-foot platform.
Laura: Oh, so Trinket can't do shit right now.
Matt: Not right now, but Trinket can move if you like.
Laura: Trinket's going to move, and I'm going to attack again, can I do that?
Matt: Yeah, you can do that.
Laura: We want to spread out.
Matt: That's as far as Trinket get can get, there.
Laura: Can I attack again?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: All right, I'll hit him again. Okay, just a regular attack through the bow.
Matt: Yep. This is your second use of it, though; you're done with it.
Laura: Yes. 17.
Matt: 17. As you fire the arrow, it takes its wing and (whoosh) batters it out of the way, and the arrow shatters in mid air. You see a burst of fire as it does nothing.
Laura: It was a 25 that hit before. What was the first attack that hit?
Taliesin: I was in the 30s.
Matt: So that ends your turn, Vex. Do you want to move, or do you want to stay right there?
Laura: Can I stealth?
Matt: (laughs) No, that's a hide action, I think.
Laura: Then I'm going to move along the wall further. Yeah, like that.
Matt: That ends your turn. Rimefang, now, shaking off the frustration, looks around the room, lifts up on its back hind legs, spreads its wings, and just gives this large roar. (roars) The entire room shakes, and you see pieces of ice and rock begin to start falling from the ceiling. Everybody, go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw. Everybody. One giant is fine. All right, starting with Percy.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: 12.
Felicia: 15.
Sam: Natural 20, but it becomes 18.
Matt: Okay.
Felicia: Because you're not wise.
Mary: 21.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: Grog?
Travis: Nine?
Matt: That's rough.
Travis: Very wise.
Sam: Oh, lots of red circles.
Matt: All right, so. The sheer amount of presence that this dragon permeates sends a shiver of fear down your spine. Vex, Percy, Grog, and one of the giants are currently frightened of the dragon. While you are frightened, you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls, and you cannot willingly move closer to the dragon.
Laura: Is Trinket frightened?
Matt: Roll for Trinket.
Laura: Okay. Come on, Trinket. No! He's probably pretty frightened. Oh, does that count as intimidation?
Matt: No, it's a wisdom saving throw. So it's whatever his wisdom bonus is.
Laura: He rolled an eight, so I'm guessing he's pretty scared.
Matt: Probably scared. Trinket, all of a sudden also (scared bear noises) backs up a little bit and is looking equally frightened, especially seeing you scared. Trinket feels a moment of fear there.
Laura: You've still got a really big dick!
Felicia: What?
Laura: I'm just telling him to encourage him.
Travis: I missed something.
Sam: Not the dragon. Although, probably the dragon too.
Matt: Rimefang then (whoosh) flies up into the air for a minute. And then swoops over and lands over on this side, and that's going to end its turn. That brings us to Grog.
Travis: I got to break it, right?
Matt: Yeah, you're scared.
Travis: Rage? I look over my shoulder, terrified, at the other one that's scared, and I say, repeat after me, lads. I would like to rage.
Matt: You reach into your inner self, and suddenly you realize this is it. You know dragons, you've fought dragons in the past, you've killed dragons in the past, and you know dragons have been responsible for hurting some of your friends and their families, and through that, that anger just billows up from inside, and that fear shakes from your body.
Travis: I want to kill a dragon like my friend Pike did.
Matt: You're now in a rage. You shake the fear effect, and you can take the rest of your turn as you see fit.
Travis: (battle cry) I would like to run over that direction.
Sam: Oh, you're running away from it?
Matt: You rage-ran.
Travis: I rage-ran. Can I attack?
Matt: You're currently hiding behind a 15-foot platform.
Travis: So I can't see beyond it?
Matt: You're literally hiding from the dragon right now. Cool. All right, that ends your turn? Zahra, you're up.
Mary: All right, how far away is it from me?
Matt: It is currently 30 feet from you.
Mary: All right.
Matt: Real fast. Grog, make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: 13?
Matt: 13?
Laura: What was that for?
Matt: As you're running through, all of a sudden the floor gives out from underneath you, and you roll off to the side. You almost fall in, catching yourself, you slide down into a pit, but manage to get your handhold on a piece of stone that's jutting out of the rock. Pull yourself up. Underneath where you were in the ground is a cracked piece of ice: a pit in the ground.
Laura: Seriously?
Matt: But you're fine. You get back up to your feet. That could've been really bad. It's about 15 feet down into these jagged shards of ice.
Laura: My passive perception is 21. Just for future reference.
Matt: Good to know. You also have no light source. You're at the far back in the darkness. Actually, you have Grog around you right now.
Mary: And I still have Light cast.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine. All right. That brings us to Zahra, once again.
Mary: I cast my bonus Hex on this beautiful beast.
Matt: It is now Hexed, as well.
Sam: What's that do? What's that?
Mary: I get extra damage.
Travis: You sexy tailed bastard.
Mary: I take my dark dragon staff, and as this moon orb begins to glow, I cast Witch Bolt-- is that it?-- yes! Witch Bolt upon it! Infused with my own internal moon fire.
Matt: All right. Do you have to roll to hit on that one?
Mary: Witch Bolt? Yeah, what do I do? It's plus 11. 5d12 plus two.
Laura: Yeah, so roll and then add 11.
Mary: 13.
Laura: Oh, that's good.
Mary: 24, plus two damage to all spells cast, so 26?
Laura: No, that's damage.
Mary: Oh, sorry, 24.
Matt: All right, so Witch Bolt does hit. Go ahead and roll damage for that.
Mary: So 5d12. Five times. All right. Do math for me, somebody. What is that? That's a three.
Travis: Three plus the two, so that's five.
Laura: You do it all and then add the two.
Travis: Oh, gotcha. Seven.
Mary: That's four.
Travis: Yeah. Plus four. 19. 26. 38.
Mary: One more?
Laura: No, that's all five.
Matt: Five, and you add 1d6 to that because of your Hex.
Laura: Plus two, so 38 is 40.
Mary: One.
Matt: Okay. So 41 points.
Mary: Yeah.
Laura: Plus anything else? Wait, plus two damage to all-- oh, but that's already--
Travis: That's already there.
Matt: Okay, so. After you Hex it, you can see the shadows around the dragon begin to form and coalesce around its torso, and as it looks around, these small demonic faces that cackle as bits of moonlight begin to pierce through these grins chokehold around its neck, and as it tries to shake it off, you bring your staff forward, and this bolt of bluish-green electrical energy shakes out in what looks like a piercing arc of jagged moonlight that strikes right into the center of the dragon's chest. As it does, the dragon's nearly pushed off its feet for a second, gathers itself, and you can see that energy surrounds it like magical shackles, it continues to keep its hold on the creature, as Witch Bolt does. All right. Do you wish to move, or are you going to stay where you are? You can move 30 feet, six squares.
Mary: I'd like to go stand by the giants.
Travis: You're already there.
Matt: Yeah, you're right here. It's hard for you to see because that guy's in the way, but you're right there.
Mary: All right. No, the other way. Blinding players as we go. Where am I? I'm there? I'd like to move to the slight cover of the pedestal.
Matt: You can get that far. All right, so there you are. That ends your turn, Zahra. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: My eyes begin to change to a dark shade as I turn my gaze to the dragon and cast Eyebite on him.
Travis: What? Cast what?
Sam: Eyebite.
Matt: All right. And how are you having that affect him?
Sam: I would like to sicken him. Give him a little tummy-ache.
Travis: Is he going to do the twirls?
Matt: Okay, we're going to do Eyebite here.
Sam: Through my Hand Cone of Clarity!
Matt: All right. So wisdom saving throw for the dragon. Use my meteor dice one of the fans out there sent. All right, what's the DC on that now total?
Sam: It's 19.
Matt: 19. That would fail. It's going to use its legendary resistance to choose to succeed instead.
Sam: It can just choose to succeed?!
Travis: How many times can it choose to do that?!
Matt: Three times per day. Welcome to fighting a dragon!
Sam: What? But that was a cool spell!
Matt: So as your eyes darken, the dragon's currently surrounded by the Witch Bolt and the Hex on the creature. You darken your eyes, and you look over and see the arcane energy taking your vision, its vision, combine it in midair. As you do, it shakes its head and (roars) shouts. You instinctively pull back, and as you do, the spell drifts away from you and you realize the incantation's lost.
Travis: Percy, use your badass motherfucker feat to have it work.
Sam: Okay, can I throw with a bonus action?
Matt: What are you going to throw?
Sam: A bag.
Matt: No, that's probably more of an action, but you can drop it as a bonus action.
Sam: Got it. Then I will move a few steps away. I can still move and stuff, right? I would like to move away from this group of soon-to-be-blasted-with-dragon-fire people. Just a few yards away to my left.
Matt: All right.
Sam: That's fine, sure, that's great. And give some inspiration to Lyra. I'll say, (singing) When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Aldor-e. (cheering)
Travis: Yeah, going deep.
Matt: And suddenly, the fear that's getting close to clutching your heart and giving you every instinct to run from this, you hear the name Aldor, and you feel that surge of warmth fill your body, and the need to push on forward. Go ahead and take a d10 inspiration dice to use in any roll you want.
Felicia: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. That's beautiful.
Sam: Well, I wrote it for you.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Scanlan. Now the giants go. This one is going to move to the side. It's deathly afraid of the dragon, it's like, this is a bad idea, it's really regretting its decision. It's going to attempt to shake the effect. And does so. (cheering)
Matt: Shakes its fright. The other one is going to step over you. As you're like, all of a sudden this foot goes (wham) in front of you, you're like, (nervous sound).
Felicia: Oh my god, I got hit with his dick. (laughter)
Travis: What were their names? Ace and Base?
Sam: Ace and Gary.
Mary: Ace and Gary.
Matt: The giant's going to move forward. It's going to attempt to make two strikes with its greataxe. That's going to be a 17, that misses. And a 16, that misses. (whooshing) Makes two strikes to the dragon, and it just dodges out of the way. The second one, it reaches up with its claw and slaps, just parries its axe out of the way and just glares at it, and you can see at that moment, the giant also itself is like (growls). Ending their turn. Lyra, you're up.
Felicia: Oh, what? Finally me? All right. I am going to get my big spell out. Now, can I target its wing and try to Disintegrate-- can I try to cut its wing off?
Matt: You know what, yeah, if you want to go ahead and try that. It's going to be a disadvantage on the attack roll.
Felicia: What is that?
Travis: Roll it twice and you get the lower number.
Matt: But does Disintegrate have--
Felicia: It doesn't have a DC.
Matt: Then it would have an advantage on the saving throw.
Felicia: Oh, okay. No, I'm going to try to hit it. It's my big gun, I don't want to be like, sorry. I'm like, I just did this and it looked amazing.
Sam: Which one are you doing?
Felicia: I'm doing Disintegrate. And it's 10d6 plus a d10, plus 40. Right? It's not the best roll, guys. There's a lot of small numbers here.
Travis: Yeah, it's only got plus 40. It's a pretty shrimpy hit.
Laura: Wait, plus 40?
Matt: Yeah, it's 10d6 plus 40 force damage.
Travis: I need to get a wand.
Matt: Disintegrate's nasty.
Felicia: 39.
Matt: 39 plus 40? All right, that's 79 points of damage. What's the DC? It's 17 on that for your spells?
Felicia: Yes.
Matt: It does make its saving throw, so half damage. But rounding up, that's 40 damage still. 40 force damage to the dragon. As you, with the swelling of energy that Scanlan gave you reminding you of Aldor, you release and once again that sickeningly green beam of arcane energy just streaks out, hits the dragon, and with a burst of arcane energy you can see part of its scales have withered, part of its wing is now tattered and missing, and immediately the physical form of the dragon, it's reeling in pain.
Laura: So if we aim at that area that doesn't have scales...
Matt: You'll find out.
Mary: But you've still got the Witch Bolt wrapping around him, yeah?
Matt: That is focused.
Felicia: I definitely want to move. I want to move over there behind that-- over here. Yeah. So I'm a little less conspicuous.
Matt: All righty. Cool. That will be the top of the round. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Still no hand-grenade.
Matt: No. The fear has shaken you, so you cannot move closer to it, and you have disadvantage on attacks.
Taliesin: What do I do to shake the fear?
Matt: At the end of your turn, you make a saving throw to try and shake it. You can't move closer to it, but you can still attack it. You cannot move closer to it, and your attacks have disadvantage.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try and take a shot at it with a standard shot for right now.
Matt: Okay. So because you've shot, reloaded, shot, reloaded. Go for it.
Taliesin: 17. Wait, and with disadvantage.
Felicia: Oh no. That's a great 20 you can't use.
Matt: Yeah. So a total of 17? As you fire, it would've hit, unfortunately it streaks through the portion of the wing that currently is left a gaping hole thanks to the Disintegrate spell, the impact of the bullet itself blasting against the back wall, sending chunks and shards of ice spilling off in the distance.
Taliesin: I would like to really quickly then go into that little corner there for some cover.
Matt: Okay. All right. Cool, so that ends your turn. Vex, you're up next.
Taliesin: Oh, I didn't roll to shake off the fear.
Matt: Go ahead and make the save.
Travis: (singing) Shake it off.
All: (singing) Shake it off!
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: Five.
Matt: Five, yeah. The fear is still clutching you internally, like, "Shit, dragon, bad, dragon!" Vex.
Laura: Can I see him at all?
Matt: Right now? No. You can see parts of the wings fluttering over, but you don't have a very good visual on it.
Laura: And he's pretty far away?
Matt: He's decent distance, yeah.
Laura: If I just try to (bowstring noise) up?
Matt: You can try to. It has three-quarters cover, so it gets a plus five to its armor class.
Laura: And I'm at disadvantage. Does it seem like if I cast something that would do mass damage, would the giant then not want to attack with us anymore?
Matt: That's a risk you'd have to take.
Travis: Drop some stank on that dragon.
Laura: I'm scared to hit the giant with it. Because I want to do Conjure Barrage, but I'm afraid of the giant.
Felicia: Well, if you do damage to him, the spell breaks.
Laura: Exactly. So that would be bad.
Sam: But he's not fighting for us because of a spell right now. We convinced him.
Felicia: Well.
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: Potentially.
Travis: Look at the poker face on that DM. Giving up nothing. Giving up nothing!
Felicia: Stone-faced.
Laura: Should I try it?
Taliesin: I don't know. What do I know?
Mary: If we damage it, this spell that I've been talking to him with goes (poof).
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to hit the dragon with a regular attack. I'm not going to do Conjure Barrage.
Matt: All right, so what's the first range increment on your longbow?
Laura: It's 120.
Matt: That's the first range increment? Yeah, it's a longbow, yeah. So you're not at disadvantage from that shot. However, it does have three-quarters cover. And given that circumstance--
Taliesin: Does she not have sharpshooter?
Laura: I don't. That's not the feat that I took. I took read lips. I'm really good in populated areas.
Matt: So go for it and roll for the attacks.
Laura: Okay, cool. Here we go! Yeah, no. Doesn't hit. (laughter)
Felicia: We're going to die!
Matt: You pull back and release the first arrow. It actually just barely scrapes the top of the platform and shatters across the ice.
Mary: Come on!
Laura: That's better! 27!
Matt: 27, even with the three-quarters cover, does hit! Go ahead and roll damage. (cheering)
Laura: Okay. What is that? 12, 13, 14! Plus a d6, because I'm badass! Plus six! That's 19. That's not even close to 40, but it does something.
Matt: It's still damage! So as you release the arrow, it just misses the top of the platform, and you get just enough of an angle that it hits one of the wings as it pulls it up, sticks into the part of its hand that crests the top of the wing. It (growls)--
Laura: And I say, fuck you!
Matt: Okay. And it echoes, "Fuck you, fuck you..." Do you or Trinket wish to move?
Laura: We're as far away as we can be, and I can't move any closer.
Matt: That's true. So now you and Trinket both make wisdom saving throws to try and shake the fear. Oh, and you're frightened, so actually, roll again on the attack. Disadvantage on the attacks. Just roll again. You're frightened.
Laura: No, both of those sucked. The first one was 20. 20 was the first!
Matt: So a total of 20 for the second roll? Well, that would hit. Well no, it has three-quarters cover so it wouldn't, unfortunately.
Laura: Matthew Mercer.
Matt: You were frightened! It's part of the effect. I had to remind myself that. So the arrow splinters off the top of the wing as it reaches upward, and you still feel the fear clutching your physical self.
Laura: Now we try to shake it off.
Matt: Now you try and shake it off.
Laura: (sings) I shake it off.
Mary: (sings) Shake it off!
Matt: First roll is for you.
Laura: I do not succeed. It's a three.
Matt: That would be a no, sorry. For Trinket?
Laura: 20! Why did you say the first one was for me? Why couldn't the second one be for me?
Matt: Because that's how it works. So while you're still scared, you look over and you see Trinket shakes it off. Trinket looks over his shoulder at you and gives you a nod of like, I got this. Turns back to the dragon and gives a (roars) giant grizzly-bear growl and shout at the dragon. Do you wish to move at all?
Laura: Where is he?
Matt: Trinket's right here.
Laura: He's going to run up for the time being and hide. Give me this.
Felicia: Hide? Why is everyone hiding?!
Laura: He's not hiding! He's going to run up to this area so that he's got a better vantage point to run up for the next turn.
Matt: That's about as far as Trinket can get right there.
Laura: He can't get any further into this little crevice?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Laura: Can he run right here?
Matt: Trinket could move here instead. That's as far as Trinket could move on his movement.
Laura: That's not really protecting him, is it?
Matt: No, but it's not over in a cluster of other people.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. Does that end your turn? Rimefang, who currently has this giant in its face, angrily decides to instead, as a legendary action at the end of your turn, actually, before it takes its turn as you've misfired and Trinket's running along, it's going to go ahead and use one of its legendary actions to do a wing attack against the giant in front of it.
Mary: No, Derek!
Travis: (laughs) Derek. It's Gary.
Mary: Gary. He told me telepathically that his name is actually Derek.
Matt: This is an interesting point. Remember, this is a dragon. It's your favored enemy. So keep that in mind, you have an advantage on attacks against it.
Laura: Do I? No, I don't. I looked it up today, yo. I don't get shit on attacks for him because we transferred over from Pathfinder. All I can do is talk to him.
Matt: The chat keeps yelling that the favored enemy--
Laura: Well, chat, I looked it up, and I don't think I have advantage.
Matt: That's true, chat. You're wrong. (shouting)
Laura: I literally texted Matt today and I was super upset.
Zac: Did chat try to challenge the DM?
Matt: Apparently.
Laura: Seriously, I thought I had it, too, and then I looked it up. In fifth edition, I don't get that.
Matt: As a favored enemy, she gets benefits, but not specifically in battle. It's more about knowing--
Sam: I appreciate the chat. Please, keep it coming.
Mary: Couldn't that inspire Vex in some way? Don't you get an inspiration roll from the chat?
Matt: Sorry.
Felicia: You know what's good is that it's a different team next week, because we're all going to die.
Mary: No! Lyra, you're our leader, come on!
Matt: Sorry, chat. You're wrong. Tried to go with you there, but you're wrong.
Laura: I shouldn't have even said anything, I should've just gone with you. I'm an idiot.
Matt: That's okay. No worries, but thank you for being honest and wrong, chat. All right, nevertheless. It's going to do a wing attack against the giant in front of it. The giant is trying to make a dexterity saving throw. Does not. The giant is knocked prone from the wings (whoosh) buffeting it with wind as it begins to take off, knocking the giant back and dealing 13 points of bludgeoning damage. The dragon then picks up and lands right there. And rears back its head (snarling roar) and unleashes a torrent of freezing cold dragon's breath. A 60-foot cone. It's going to hit the giant, it's going to hit Lyra, and it's going to hit Percy.
Taliesin: Do I not have some cover?
Matt: Not against dragon's breath, unfortunately. So I need both of you guys to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw from the sheer freezing cold.
Felicia: Oh no. That didn't go well for me.
Sam: Plus three.
Felicia: Oh, that's true. No, that's damage.
Taliesin: 20.
Sam: Wait. She gets my inspiration on this throw.
Matt: If she chooses to use it, yes.
Felicia: Yes, I definitely want to use it.
Matt: So add a d10 to what you rolled.
Felicia: Ten! Thank god, because that's a 21.
Matt: 21, okay. All right, so both of you take half of the 54 damage it would've dealt.
Laura: 54 damage?
Matt: You both take 27 points of cold damage. The giant that had been partially disintegrated before by Lyra now takes the brunt of the frozen damage, and you can now see the ice begins to build up around it as it (gurgling) gurgles as its life's blood is now stilled. While frozen in place, the ice around its physical form holding it there as a statue of death. The giant is no more.
Travis: No!
Mary: No!
Laura: What? No!
Sam: Grog, go get his axe! It's really big!
Laura: Is it too big to carry? He's got a flaming axe right now.
Matt: All right, and that ends Rimefang's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to race back from whence I came to attack his right flank, if I could.
Matt: You could get there. You will have to make-- actually, no, you can move through there without an issue.
Travis: Also, I have darkvision up to 60 feet.
Matt: You rush up towards the dragon.
Travis: I'd like to take my Firebrand Warhammer and activate it. Ignite it.
Matt: As a bonus action. Well, it's already been ignited, you've had it flaming this whole time.
Travis: Oh, beautiful, yeah. It's like a torch, which means I can see even better. I'd like to go into a frenzied rage and start swinging away.
Matt: All right, so three attacks on the big old dragon.
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19 does hit.
Travis: Beautiful. 25.
Matt: Does hit.
Travis: And 23.
Matt: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay, so this is the new thing. d10 plus five plus eight. Plus another--
Travis: d10?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You're hitting with a weapon that's not as big as your greataxe, but you do an additional 1d6 fire damage when you hit.
Travis: Holy shit. Ah!
Matt: d10 and a d6 together three times. Plus eight to each.
Travis: Three d10s?
Laura: Yes. Plus 3d6.
Matt: Plus eight to what you roll on both of those.
Travis: You threw a bunch of numbers at me.
Matt: All right, so a d10 and a d6 plus eight.
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19 damage.
Travis: Do I do that three times? Oh, wow. 19, and that's 12.
Matt: 12, all right.
Travis: 12 and then, help me numbers, that's--
Laura: Oh, that's good, 16. Plus? Ooh. 21.
Matt: Nice. (whack) As you bring the warhammer down, it smacks the side of the dragon, the flames all of a sudden burst off of it from the impact, you can see as you pull back, the white scales are burned and charred and blackened behind from the first attack. You bring it back, slam again on the second part. As you do, the dragon roars out in pain, the actual force of the impact almost sending it to catch itself on the other side of its body. Its head swings around to look at whoever's slamming it in the side as you bring the hammer back, swing underneath and then hit it from underneath the bottom of its torso, right where its ribs would be, with a (crunch) crack sound. You hit it a third time, leaving a second giant charred mark where you made impact.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: That'll end your turn. Zahra, you're up.
Mary: All right, I've still got Witch Bolt.
Matt: You do.
Mary: And it's still going, yes?
Matt: You don't have to roll to attack again. You just use your action.
Mary: I just fucking keep going with the fucking Witch Bolt. Can I use a cantrip, or will that dispel the Witch Bolt?
Matt: No, because most cantrips take an action. So you would not be able to. The Witch Bolt is your action. Almost all cantrips are actions to use them, so you'd be either able to use your action and the Witch Bolt, or use the cantrip. Your choice.
Mary: No, no, I'm going to stick with Witch Bolt. I'm very happy with this.
Matt: So you focus yet again, your eyes still glowing in that strange, midnight moon color with this black smoke that's framing the side of it. You take your staff and force your will through it once again. That connection between you and the dragon and that weird swirling greenish-blue energy that surrounds the dragon connects with your staff. And as it does, it sends another bolt of otherworldly energy careening into the side of the dragon. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: I watch her with my mouth agape.
Travis: d12.
Laura: Five times.
Travis: We got you.
Mary: 12. 17.
Travis: 19.
Laura: Ooh, 30.
Travis: Ooh, 30.
Laura: 37.
Mary: 37.
Laura: And one more.
Travis: No, that's five.
Matt: That was five. Then you roll a 1d6 on top of that.
Mary: Plus two on that.
Matt: All right, so 38, then a d6 from your Hex.
Mary: Six.
Matt: So 44 points of damage.
Laura: Nice!
Matt: As it once again, a giant piece of the dragon's scales shatter off the side, like you're cracking into the center of an icy, mountainous cragside. It's starting to show a little bit of damage. You guys are definitely taking this battle head-on pretty well so far.
Travis: I don't like the way he said that.
Matt: You're going to stay where you are, or are you going to move?
Mary: How close am I to it?
Matt: You're currently 20 feet away from the dragon. 15 is between the two of you.
Mary: All right. I stay within 30 feet of it.
Matt: All right, so you want to move this way?
Mary: I want to get up to the heavens. Oh, sorry. I'm going to actually, you know what? I'm going to move three feet backwards, that's it.
Matt: Okay, so you just step back? Okay. There you go. All right. That ends Zahra's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: How close am I?
Matt: You are currently about 20 feet away from the dragon.
Sam: All right. Yes. Hi. Scanlan here. I'll do, (singing) It's Bigby's Hand! Bigby's Hand. Shamone. I'll just punch him in his dragon face.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. You do a quick little hand gesture, hum to yourself the arcane ritual, and a very large, mystical see-through replica of your fist appears in the air above you and goes spinning off in the air in an arc. Straight up Popeye-punching towards the dragon. (laughs) Let's go ahead, and Bigby-- what do you have to roll for that?
Sam: Oh, I have to roll for that?
Matt: Let me see what the effect is on that, remind myself real fast. Bigby's Hand. All right, so it's an AC of 20. Or no, that's the hand, all right. Clenched fist, cool. So make a melee spell attack. So roll a d20 and then add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: That's the spell attack bonus thing? Okay. 19.
Matt: 19. (wham) Just barely hits as the fist goes slamming into the side of the dragon's face, big old Popeye punch to the side of the jaw. So go ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage.
Sam: 4d8. I'm taking yours, and I hope that's okay. Ten, 13, 18, 21. Plus something?
Matt: That's 21 points of damage, nice. (whack) It gets socked in the jaw. The hand whips around again, preparing for the next round. Do you want to use anything, move, use your bonus action?
Sam: I'm 20 feet away. I will go 18 feet away from it and drop the grenade.
Matt: Okay. So you move forward right here?
Sam: Yeah, closer to it.
Matt: Okay. The grenade is right there on the ground that Percy made. All right. Going to stay where you are?
Sam: Can I keep moving?
Matt: You can keep moving. You moved 18 feet backward, you mean?
Sam: No, I had to move closer to it.
Matt: Right, so you moved three feet of your 25 feet, dropped it, and you still have 22 feet you can move.
Sam: But if I leave, he's going to whack me.
Matt: No, he's this far away. You have to be within a certain range for him to hit you.
Sam: Wait, how close did I put the grenade to him?
Matt: It's currently 18 feet away from him.
Sam: No, I wanted to put it two feet away from him.
Matt: Oh, I see! There, that makes more sense. So now there is a grenade on the ground, right there. You are there, right next to Grog. So yeah, you cannot move away without it taking a swipe.
Travis: Oh, look at that.
Sam: Hello, I'm a little gnome.
Travis: It's adorable.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. The giant that's here gets up. That's half of its movement. It's enough to get there, moves up behind and is going to make two of its axe-swipes.
Mary: Hit him in the arse!
Felicia: Butthole.
Sam: That was crass.
Matt: 15 doesn't hit. Second attack is going to be a 13. It's rolling shit. It swings twice and manages to catch air.
Felicia: The most useless giant.
Matt: Apparently. But you know what, they didn't smash you yet. That's a good thing. That brings us to Lyra's turn.
Felicia: Question. Can I Fireball without hitting anybody who's friendly?
Matt: From this point of view, it's going to be very difficult to pull that off. It's a 20-foot radius, so it's going to hit everything within that sphere.
Travis: Oh, you actually care about us that much?
Mary: Can I use-- everybody is really close. All right.
Felicia: Okay, so I can't do that. I think I'm going to cast Hold Monster.
Matt: Hold Monster! You take your arcane thoughts and you put them around, imagining this arcane cage that begins to form out of the ether around the dragon. These bars (crash) and tighten around it. The dragon rolls a two for its saving throw. (cheering)
Matt: But it's going to use its Legendary Resistance to automatically succeed.
Felicia: How many of those does he have?!
Travis: He has one more.
Felicia: I need to move.
Matt: (laughs) The cage tightens around it, and the dragon takes its wings and (shattering) buffs it off, the arcane cage shatters and disappears into the air.
Felicia: I was going to be impressive. Okay. I'm going to get the H out. I'm going to get as far as I can in that corner. Yeah, thank you. Bye-bye.
Matt: All righty. Good to know. All right, that ends your turn. That brings us back to the top. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to-- That grenade is sitting on top of people right now, isn't it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: You mean that hamster, right?
Matt: Your call, man.
Travis: Come on, live a little.
Taliesin: It's going to hit you.
Travis: Well, that's all right.
Laura: Yeah, but it's also going to hit Scanlan.
Matt: You still have disadvantage on your attacks, by the way.
Taliesin: Even if my attack is not against the dragon?
Matt: As long as it's within eyesight of you, you're scared.
Taliesin: Okay, in that case, I'm going to take a shot at the dragon for the moment.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Forget about that.
Matt: Disadvantage on the shot.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19. That's with disadvantage? Does hit. (cheering)
Taliesin: Oh, that's nice. 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage, nice.
Sam: Hey! Percy.
Taliesin: I have moments.
Matt: All right, and you reload with the other one. You can't move closer to it. Do you wish to move at all?
Taliesin: No, I'm going to hold my position.
Matt: Okay. Before the end of your turn--
Taliesin: I was about to say, before I do that, I'm going to use a bonus action to do a quick heal. I'm going to use second wind.
Matt: Oh, a second wind, go for it. So you go ahead and heal yourself 1d10 plus your level.
Taliesin: That's 11 points of damage.
Matt: There you go. So you heal 11 points of damage. Before your turn is over, it's going to use its last legendary action to take its tail and swing around and whack it at the gnome that it heard sneak up behind it and drop something on the ground. That's going to be a natural 20. (shouting)
Laura: He said it so happily, too. Evil.
Taliesin: You're in trouble.
Sam: Wait, what did he do?
Matt: As you drop it, you look up and see its tail go (whoosh, whack).
Sam: Whoa, but can I sing real quick?
Matt: It's a natural 20. There's no way you can avoid this hit.
Sam: Maybe it'll fling me away from the grenade.
Felicia: (singing) Bye bye bye.
Travis: No, not cool!
Matt: 36 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail slams down onto you.
Laura: And also onto the grenade.
Sam: But it's not a concussion grenade.
Travis: Oh, I'm right fucking there! I was going to move!
Laura: I'm sorry!
Matt: And down onto the grenade you set on the ground. (boom)
Sam: Is it a concussion grenade? It's already armed, isn't it?
Matt: It is filled with black powder, and is a triggerable mechanism.
Laura: I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.
Matt: I appreciate the reminder, because I totally forgot for a second. As it slams into you and the ground, it slams into the grenade and there's an explosion muffled sound from underneath its tail. I want Grog and Scanlan to go ahead and make dexterity saving throws.
Travis: Yes! 21.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: 20.
Matt: All right. Both of you guys manage to keep low to the ground, avoiding most of the blast.
Sam: I'm already low to the ground.
Matt: All right. Both of you guys take half damage from the strike. You both take 12 points of fire and bludgeoning damage.
Laura: Did the dragon take damage?
Matt: The dragon does not make its saving throw against it, though, and takes the full-- what'd I tell you guys? 12?
Sam: All right! The grenade worked! (cheering)
Matt: Pulls its tail up, and there's like a big arc of smoke off of its tail as it pulls it up and shakes out the pain that it just suffered.
Taliesin: Can I take this moment of engineering success to try and pull a wisdom saving throw against my fear that I missed on my turn?
Matt: That's right, forgot that. So go ahead and make your wisdom saving throw. The explosion was the inspiration you required.
Taliesin: Natural 20! (cheering)
Taliesin: It worked! (cackles)
Matt: With the explosion the grenade set off, you realize, wait, you might actually have this, and it worked! You could do this!
Taliesin: I built a thing! And it blew up! Kind of on purpose!
Matt: There you go. At the end of your turn, that's its final legendary action. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Can I try to shake off the attack?
Matt: At the end of your turn, you do.
Laura: Oh, at the end. But I was inspired by that explosion!
Matt: It was inspiring. It may help you shake it off at the end of the round.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to attack it. Oh, that's such a good roll.
Mary: That is. Oh, that's even better!
Laura: That's okay. It was a disadvantage. That's 27 with a disadvantage with the exploding arrow.
Matt: With the Exploding Arrow? That does hit.
Travis: More Percy goodness.
Laura: So what do I do? Do I just roll regular?
Matt: So go ahead and roll regular arrow damage. With an additional 2d6. Sorry, 3d6. Well, with the arrow, it's 2d6. The grenade was 3d6. You're 2d6.
Laura: Oh shit. 16 and then 3d6?
Matt: 3d8, sorry.
Laura: 3d8?!
Matt: Sorry. 3d8 was the grenade. 2d8 for the exploding arrow. 2d8.
Laura: 2d8.
Matt: Sorry. It's a lot of numbers.
Laura: That's okay, I'm going to roll them both. Okay. Six additional. Did I say what my other damage was. Was I speaking out loud?
Matt: Yeah, no. I marked it down. I also need Scanlan and Grog to make dexterity saving throws.
Laura: Oh no, I'm sorry, I'm stupid!
Sam: Wait, what did you just shoot at us?
Laura: An exploding arrow!
Sam: Nice.
Travis: 18.
Sam: 11.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I also meant to say I was shooting from my Blood-Seeker Bow. I pulled it out and said I was going to do it.
Matt: You pull out your Blood-Seeker Bow?
Laura: I was going to shoot from my Blood-Seeker Bow for that.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I do that?
Matt: I'll let it. So it is now taking an ongoing ten points of bleeding damage? Now, you take three points of fire damage. Scanlan, you take six points of fire damage. You guys avoid the grenade, and then (arrow noises) a second explosion again.
Taliesin: I'm sorry. I'm a genius! I'm sorry! Sorry! Oh god, I'm clever.
Laura: So for my second attack, I want to throw Trinket in and I want Trinket to go up and attack him.
Matt: Trinket rushes in and is going to make two attacks at it.
Laura: He's going to do two claw attacks, so that's 2d4 each time.
Matt: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for the first strike. He's no longer scared, so Trinket does not have the disadvantage.
Laura: Okay, he doesn't hit on the first one. But the second one, he gets a 21!
Matt: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Yes! Okay. Was I wrong?
Mary: That's 23.
Laura: Oh, okay. Either way.
Matt: It hits even harder!
Mary: It hits harder?
Matt: (Irish accent) Exactly. What's that about? Rightly so.
Laura: That's 13 extra damage for Trinket.
Matt: 13 extra damage as Trinket runs up, first strike hits the armor and just streaks across without damage, but as soon as the dragon turns around to see the giant brown bear that has gotten brave enough to strike it, its other claw goes and sinks into the side of one of its calves and tears a portion of the dragon's flesh. It (snarls) roars and Trinket, bringing its claw down, roars back at it. Dragon roar versus bear roar. All right. That ends your turn. It is now Rimefang's turn. Rimefang--
Mary: He has no more of these legendary saves, yes?
Sam: No, he has one.
Matt: Well, one more legendary resistance.
Felicia: He used a wing-buffet and then two saves.
Sam: He's got one more.
Felicia: Oh, one more save. Ugh.
Sam: If he chooses to use it. He might save it for later in the fight.
Matt: Great. So the dragon is now going to (flapping) fly--
Sam: No, he won't. I cast a spell on it as it retreats from me because I am a war caster.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And I will cast Bigby's Hand to grapple that shit and pull him back down. (cheering)
Matt: That's right, you took the war caster feat. Okay.
Sam: Don't you fly away from me, motherfucker!
Travis: So hot for you right now.
Matt: All right, so you use your action to do Bigby's Clenched, no, Grasping Hand. No, it's--
Sam: It's the grapple one to pull its wings together so it can't fly away?
Matt: Yes. All right, so. So you use the hand's strength score, so go ahead and roll a d20 and then add plus eight to it.
Sam: 18 plus eight. 26.
Matt: As the dragon brings its wings up, the hand grabs its wings together and forces it back down to the ground. It shakes off the effect, but it's unable to fly away.
Sam: You will leave when Burt Reynolds tells you to leave! (laughter)
Matt: Okay. You also deal 2d6 plus five damage to it.
Sam: 2d6. That's another 18.
Matt: 18 points of damage as the hand crushes on it, holding it in place, it does not get a chance to move. All right. Angrily, in reaction to that, the dragon-- well, first off let me see. Does not get its breath weapon back yet, unfortunately. It is going to use multiattack, so it gets three attacks: one bite and two claw attacks. It's going to make all of them against you.
Sam: Of course it does. And thus ends Scanlan.
Travis: No!
Mary: No!
Matt: We'll make each attack as it goes. So the first attack against you is going to be the bite attack. That is a 23 to hit?
Sam: That hits.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Are you unconscious?
Sam: I will be very soon.
Matt: That's going to be 18 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Oh no, Scanlan's unconscious!
Matt: Are you unconscious? Okay. It would be an additional d8 points of cold damage. Scanlan falls unconscious on the ground. It's going to take a claw attack down. It's already all-in. Its second claw attack hits. You immediately fail a death saving throw from the second strike. The second claw attack hits you, as well, as it's focused on you. You've failed two death saving throws.
Laura: Oh my god!
Sam: It's a dragon.
Matt: That's the end of his turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I race over to Scanlan and I pour a level-3 healing potion into Scanlan's mouth.
Matt: Okay, so Grog, you use your action to pull out, grab Scanlan, and pour it into his mouth. This is the superior one?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: You heal 8d4 plus eight hit points.
Sam: Do I roll? Does he roll?
Matt: I'll let you roll for it; it's fine.
Sam: 8d4? Can I roll 4d8s?
Matt: (laughs) 8d4.
Sam: 8d4.
Matt: You have a better chance, actually.
Travis: This is my friend of the lady favors. I need him!
Matt: As you see the dragon bites down on him, he falls unconscious on the ground, the ice around his wounds, and his eyes just roll back into his head, unconscious. One claw slams down into his body, the gnome shakes from the impact. The second claw comes down into his torso and pulls back, you can see bits of flesh and muscle pull back from its claw as it pulls away, and Scanlan's on death's door. You rush over and grab and lift him up, take the healing potion, pop off the cork with your teeth, and you rage-feed him the potion. "Drink it!"
Sam: I'm at 19 now.
Matt: So you're at 19 hit points and you're conscious now, the wounds seal up. You've still failed two death saving throws. They're gone until the end of the battle.
Travis: Can I do anything else after I've poured it into his-- can I do anything else?
Matt: You have a bonus action.
Travis: Can I throw him the fuck away from the dragon? Pick him up and chuck him towards Lyra?
Matt: I'll say because you're frenzied raged, normally you would get an additional attack. I will say you can use that.
Travis: And I won't throw. I'll slide him on the icy floor towards Lyra.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: Okay. Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: As he wakes up, Grog goes (grunts, whoosh) and slip-n-slides you across the icy floor. You come to a stop about 15 feet away-- actually, be about there. You're still prone; you're on the ground.
Laura: But you can take a potion on your turn, at least?
Travis: And I just turn around and give it the eyebrow of you're-fucking-dead.
Matt: (laughs) All right. That ends Grog's turn. Zahra, you're up.
Mary: Witch Bolt. Fucking Witch Bolt.
Matt: By the way, your Bigby's Hand has faded, because when you fell unconscious you lost concentration. Witch Bolt?
Mary: If you're still within range. I push even harder for Scanlan's sake.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll 5d12, I believe it is?
Mary: The fire turns from white to yellow. I'm raging. What is it?
Matt: Whatever the spell is. Is it 5d10 or 5d12?
Mary: It is 5d12.
Matt: There you go. 5d12 plus 1d6.
Mary: Eight. Give me some math here, guys.
Travis: Okay. 14. 29. 45.
Mary: 45 plus two.
Laura: 47.
Mary: Plus 11 attack.
Laura: No, 47, and 1d6.
Mary: 1d6. Six.
Matt: All right, so what's the total damage on that, then?
Laura: 53.
Mary: 51.
Matt: 51 points of damage.
Travis: Did I best you on math? It's a dark day when Grog beats Vex on math.
Mary: She's very upset about the whole Scanlan thing.
Laura: I'm still very scared!
Matt: That is nasty. All right, so. As you blast again, the fury of seeing Scanlan torn down to the ground and nearly devoured by this dragon, you blast again. This time the greenish-blue energy flaring up into a vibrant, angry yellow, and now you can see what once was almost like a bolt of arcane moon energy becomes an actual burning fire in its visual. Do you wish to move, or are you going to stay where you are?
Mary: I'm still how many feet away from him?
Matt: You are currently 20 feet away from him.
Mary: I will stay where I am.
Matt: All right.
Mary: Can I give-- no I can't, I'd have to go and give it to him, wouldn't I?
Matt: At the end of your turn, because it's regained its legendary actions, it's going to use a wing attack against Grog and every creature around it, including Trinket and the one giant. So as it takes the hit from the Witch Bolt, (heavy breathing) the arcane hand no longer grasping its wings, its wings flare out, (whoosh) and swings around with its wings, hitting everything around you. Dexterity saving throw for Grog, for the giant, and for Trinket. Giant does not make it.
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18, it's a DC 19. Make it for Trinket.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: All right, so Trinket and Grog both take 13 points of bludgeoning damage and are both knocked prone.
Travis: Halved, because I'm raging.
Laura: Halved, because he's got Stoneskin.
Matt: Yeah. Trinket takes half damage, as well. So you both take seven points of bludgeoning damage, but you're still knocked prone. You both fall onto your back. The giant also is knocked prone there. All right. That ends Zahra's turn. That brings us to Scanlan. You're conscious. You're on the ground.
Sam: I will stand.
Matt: All right. So you still have half your movement. You can still move roughly ten feet. Any direction.
Sam: Taking a potion is an action or a bonus?
Matt: I consider it a bonus action to keep things moving. Action to administer it to somebody else.
Travis: Do that thing.
Sam: I will Dimension Door way over there.
Matt: (laughs) Okay. Scanlan stands up, waves his hand, and this blackened archway just (whoosh) appears next to him with this crackling sound of energy. He leaps through it and vanishes out of sight. You are now in darkness, you cannot see anything except for a little bit of light bouncing off of the top of the cavern, glittering across all the ice crystals, but you are in complete shadow. (breathing heavily)
Sam: And I'll take one of those four healing potions that someone gave us. Were they moderate?
Matt: They were superior. I think Grog used one.
Felicia: Yeah, we handed them out.
Sam: Okay, I definitely have one, so I'll take it.
Matt: 8d4 plus eight.
Laura: Who all took them?
Mary: I didn't, because I have two.
Felicia: I don't think she and I took them.
Laura: Oh, the four of us, because we're assholes?
Matt: I think you each took one.
Felicia: I sacrificed myself.
Matt: So we'll consider that. It's fine. All right, so that ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is going to get up.
Travis: Get up, Gary, you piece of shit!
Matt: That would be a 21. That hits. And that'll be a 17. That misses. But it does manage to hit with an attack, finally. This whole time. That's 24 points of slashing damage to the dragon. As its first strike whiffs, and as it brings it back with a backhand, it brings its shield up to protect itself. The axe (smack) lands a good seven to eight inches into the dragon's hide. (roars) The head turns around. "You traitor! I will eat every one of you!" That ends the giant's turn. It's going to stay right there, trying to finish him off. That ends the giant's turn. Lyra, you're up.
Felicia: I still can't Fireball, right?
Matt: You could? Depending on where you want to place it, you may hit other things.
Laura: You can place it-- hit the giant and the dragon.
Felicia: Then the giant will wake up. If we hit the giants-- does he look almost dead?
Matt: You can tell he's taken a few hits from the dragon, but the other one is the one that was completely wrecked.
Laura: Is the other giant dead?
Matt: It is frozen in place and dead. It was partially disintegrated by Lyra earlier, and the frost breath finished it off.
Felicia: I could maybe hit Trinket or Grog?
Sam: Trinket's protected.
Felicia: I don't think he's protected from fire damage. It's a lot of damage. I don't want to kill Trinket.
Travis: Is it fire, and it's a frost dragon?
Felicia: It's a very big spell. It's 8d6. Can't really use it. I'll try to Hold Monster again.
Laura: How much radius does the dragon take up?
Matt: The dragon itself is 15 feet across on each side, so if you were to hit the dragon, it would still hit everything directly around it.
Felicia: Yeah, let me try to Hold Monster again. At least force him to use his thing.
Matt: All right. Actually, he fails his saving throw, but uses his third and final legendary resistance to resist the Hold Monster spell.
Taliesin: Good, you drained it. That's over with.
Matt: He's out of legendary resistance. He turns around and looks at you now. It was currently glaring at the giant, growling at everyone around it, and as soon as that spell hits it with the cage once again, (heavy impacts) it breaks it with its wings and turns around, (whoosh) and opens its mouth right towards you.
Felicia: I'm going to move away as far as I can.
Matt: Okay. So you are here.
Felicia: Yes. That's very far. Yes. Thank you.
Matt: Okay. All right, that ends your turn. Back up to Percy.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to take one last really good shot. I'm going to shoot him right in the face again. I'm going to spend my grit point and hit him in the face. Let's make this work. Yay! That hits. That's 31 to hit.
Matt: 31 will hit, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: I'm going to roll damage. That's 15 points of damage, but he's got disadvantage on all attacks until my turn.
Matt: He did take ten points of bleeding damage from your-- Laura. It did take ten points of bleeding damage from your bow, and it does save against the bleed effect, so that's gone, unfortunately. But you did ten additional damage to him.
Taliesin: I'm going to move in this direction. Hug the wall.
Matt: Right there?
Taliesin: Yeah, I think right there.
Matt: Okay. So as you take your shot, (gunshot) it ricochets off the armor. The dragon's starting to look a little rough. You can see bits of the blood beginning to seep from the inside of its scales. It's starting to look a little harsher and harsher. It's still standing up pretty well, but you can see, it's starting to get a little more battle-worn. That ends Percy's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to move Trinket away.
Matt: Trinket stands up, and Trinket's going to move back this way.
Laura: Yeah, and then hide behind that outcropping thing. Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As he moves away, the dragon uses his reaction. It's going to be a bite attack on him, actually.
Taliesin: With disadvantage.
Matt: With disadvantage?
Taliesin: With disadvantage.
Matt: Oh, because of the head shot. Yeah. Well, it rolled a two and a 15. (cheering)
Matt: So thank god you put that on there. So as it (whoosh) lashes out, Trinket's armor actually takes the impact, and some of the teeth crack a little bit against the armor, and the jaw pulls back as Trinket just (bear moan) runs off behind the ice wall. What are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns.
Matt: Did you make a wisdom save last turn to try to resist the fear effect?
Laura: I did, and I failed it.
Matt: That's right. Okay.
Laura: Yeah. So I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26 hits, yes. Hail of Thorns. What's the radius on that?
Laura: That's a good question. Hail of Thorns.
Matt: (laughs) How's that go?
Laura: Okay, wait. Next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon-- spell-- range. It just hits it, but then everything within five feet makes a dexterity saving throw. Sorry, guys.
Matt: So Grog, make a dexterity saving throw. Because you're prone, I'd say with disadvantage.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, Grog.
Travis: Nine?
Matt: Actually, you're fine. Just straight roll.
Travis: Oh, great. 18.
Matt: 18? All right. You take half of the 1d10 piercing damage. So roll for the actual arrow damage, and then 1d10. The giant does not make it, and the dragon does not make it. They both fail.
Laura: 13 for the actual arrow, plus another five for Hunter's Mark.
Matt: All right. What's the 1d10 for the Hail of Thorns?
Laura: 3d10 because I'm casting it at 3rd level. 18 for the Hail of Thorns.
Matt: 18. So that's nine points of damage to you, Grog. Nine points to the giant, and nine points to the dragon. All right.
Laura: Oh. And then I get another attack.
Matt: You do. You have two attacks.
Laura: (giggles) This is crazy! Okay, so I'm going to-- should I do Conjure Barrage? Conjure Barrage at them, as well.
Matt: All right. Conjure Barrage is an action to cast, right?
Laura: Oh, you're right. So a regular. I can only do a regular attack. Okay, so regular attack. Oh, that doesn't hit. That's a 16.
Matt: That unfortunately does not hit. Well, it hits, but the arrow shatters across the dragon's armor. All right, that ends your turn. As the giant takes a blasting impact of thorns across its torso, it looks to the dragon, Rimefang. Looks at the rest of you, which some of you have fallen, some of you are on the ground. It decides that perhaps it chose its alliances poorly. And you can see, it takes its axe and shield ready, and almost in a phalanx format is now alongside the dragon. All right, that brings us to Rimefang's turn. Rimefang is going to (flapping) fly up in the air.
Travis: Oh, he's reaching for shit. He duplicates himself into another dragon. Now you're all dead.
Matt: Now he's going to--
Travis: Oh no, the ale's gone!
Matt: This way, up at the top, and is currently up in the air (flapping). Let's see. He gets his cold breath back. Oh, did you roll to try and shake the frightened effect, by the way?
Laura: I didn't.
Matt: Go ahead and do that now.
Mary: Come on, darling. Come on!
Laura: Natural 20!
Travis: Natural 20!
Matt: That will do it. As you shake the frightened effect, you're like, "Ah! All right." You're steeled. "No, I know these guys. I'm trying to kill these guys." As you see it fly overhead. Rears back its head and then (whoosh) arc across the ground with its breath weapon, hitting Percy, Vex, and Lyra. You guys all need to make constitution saving throws.
Taliesin: Oh, so there's no disadvantage roll for him to make here, is there?
Matt: No.
Felicia: 23.
Matt: 23 on the constitution saving throw?
Felicia: Yeah, I actually. I get five constitution, and I rolled an 18.
Taliesin: 15.
Matt: 15? What did you roll, Vex?
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. All right. (chuckles) So as the ice breath (whoosh) passes across, it's like every center point of the worst ice storm or blizzard impacting you with a series of punches every single second as this breath caresses and beats your body left and right. Both of you guys take 54 points of cold damage.
Taliesin: 54?
Matt: 54. Lyra, you take 27 points of cold damage.
Travis: And the room gets quiet.
Mary: Really fast.
Matt: It continues its flight pattern (flapping, impacts) and lands on top of this upper platform.
Laura: Oh, he's got another fucking platform?
Sam: How high up?
Matt: That's ten feet up. There are two platforms on opposite sides of this room now. That ends its turn. It is now Grog's turn.
Travis: That giant is definitely against us?
Matt: It looks to be questioning its loyalty at the moment, yeah.
Travis: You questioned at the wrong time. I charge Gary and hack away.
Matt: All right. You get up, and you have enough movement, definitely, to move up into battle with him. Go ahead and attack.
Travis: (laughs) What do I do, again? What is this shit? This thing plus five. 16. No, attack bonus.
Matt: You have to hit first. You have to roll to hit.
Travis: I know. Jesus! It's like I've never done this before. 24.
Laura: No, that was higher than 24.
Travis: 16 plus nine? Oh, it's 25.
Matt: Hits. Roll a second attack.
Travis: 28.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: And 20.
Matt: 20 hits. Roll damage against the giant.
Travis: (quietly) What is this, 1d10 plus five? Oh, that's ten. 18. 18?
Laura: Plus six fire damage.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: Six!
Travis: 24 on the first one.
Matt: Nice.
Travis: Sorry, new math. 13 plus-- 17 on the second one.
Matt: All right, and the third one?
Travis: 12, plus-- 15 on the third one.
Matt: As you rush forward, (whack, whack) the first two hits, one hits in the side, and you can see it (grunts) reacts. The second one, it brings its shield up, and you splinter the buckler shield on its arm, and as it shatters, you can see the bones in its arm (crunch) crack from the impact, and it drops its arm to one side, with the flames itself beginning to set fire to the furs it has on its arm. (grunts) He tries to shake off the fire that's on its arm. As you see it bring its arm up, it reveals the underside of its torso. You use that to reach down, leap in the air with an overhead swipe, slam this warhammer with all your strength into the side of its ribcage. As you do, (crack) you can see its torso cave in, and you're probably sure that the splintered bones seem to have impacted something serious as the giant all of a sudden, (death rattle). (cheering)
Mary: Dead? Dead!
Matt: From the damage left over from the battle you had earlier, the damage it already took from the dragon, and that was just enough to finish it off by two hit points. That ends your turn, Grog. Zahra, you're up.
Mary: How far away from the dragon am I?
Matt: You are 30 feet away.
Mary: That's exactly right, which means Witch Bolt is still in effect, and I'm going to fucking unleash on this white wyrm of death.
Matt: All right! (boof) A third time, now, you release Witch Bolt. It slams into it. The dragon actually tries to shift out of the way--
Mary: He can't.
Matt: He can't, because you're locked in.
Mary: You can't get away from me.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Creepy Zahra!
Mary: Creepy Zahra. Well, I am a demon. All right. 11.
Travis: 27. 39. 48. 1d6. 53.
Mary: 53.
Felicia: Damn!
Travis: You bad bitch!
Matt: All right, so. It tries to dodge out of the way. This time, as you focus again, the yellowish energy has now transitioned to a deep, hot, searing red flame from your eyes.
Mary: Oh, you can't run!
Matt: (boof) You focus again. The beam now, transitioning into a similar red-hot color, streaks across and slams into the side of the dragon. You can see the impact. The scales are left with this glowing red heat from the blast, and part of its armor is torn open. You can see the burn-charred muscle beneath. The dragon's looking pretty rough. Do you wish to move, or are you staying right there?
Mary: I'm going to approach it by five feet.
Matt: There you go. That brings us to Scanlan's turn. You are way over here.
Sam: I will first use my bonus action on myself. Can I cast Healing Word on myself?
Matt: Yeah. Sure.
Sam: Okay, d4 plus five. That's nothing. Actually, wait. Can I just take a potion as a bonus action?
Matt: If you want to, yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll just do that. I'll take a greater heal. 4d4 plus four.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Anyway, I'll roll it later. Sorry. (counts quietly) Plus four is 11. Okay, I'm pretty much back up to--
Matt: There you go. Are you going to stay where you are?
Sam: I'm how far?
Matt: You are over here.
Sam: But how far?
Matt: Oh. It's 90 feet away from you.
Sam: (whispering) Sniper shot. (louder) From the shadows, I cast Lightning Bolt, which has a hundred-foot range.
Matt: It does, and because it's high enough--
Sam: If the angle is nice and clean.
Matt: Yes, that's true. So out of the darkness, release a bolt of energy. It's going to attempt to make a saving throw. What's the DC on it?
Sam: It's my spell? What is it?
Matt: Yeah, it's whatever your spell DC is.
Sam: 17?
Matt: 17, okay. It does make its saving throw, so it is half damage. Go ahead and roll. Rolled a 16 plus five.
Sam: It was 8d6, but now it's 4d6, right?
Matt: No, it's 8d6 still. You roll the total, and it's halved.
Sam: All right, what is that? (counts quietly) 26. 13.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Yes, dude. Way not to be dead.
Felicia: Way to not die.
Travis: I need my whoring partner.
Matt: All right, at the end of your turn, it's going to use one of its legendary actions to make a tail attack and reach over the side here at Percy, who's trying to stay hidden there. Brings around his tail. (whoosh) Comes swinging down over the side. Another natural 20. (groaning)
Felicia: He looks disappointed.
Laura: He doesn't want us to die.
Felicia: It's going to happen.
Mary: No! Would you stop it, Lyra? Come on!
Felicia: I'm sorry. I have self-esteem issues.
Mary: Not today, you don't.
Matt: 32 points of bludgeoning damage to you, Percy. (whack) From over the top.
Taliesin: I'm out.
Matt: Percy is down as the tail (whack) slams him down. You can see now, as the tail pulls back, the ice on the ground is slightly concave. There's pieces of ice that have shattered and jutted up from the impact. As the tail pulls away, dropping chunks of stone and ice, you can see a currently unconscious Percy is now face-down and pushed probably a good half-foot into the ground itself. Your face is a mess, if they ever pull you up from that right now.
Taliesin: I like my face.
Matt: That ends Scanlan's turn. The giant is dead. There are no giants; they're gone. Lyra, you're up.
Felicia: Okay, I can Fireball him now. (cheering)
Felicia: Fireball. Ooh, that looks pretty good! Six and six and six.
Laura: Come on, Lyra. Killing blow.
Travis: Nuke him. Nuke the bastard.
Felicia: So that's 18, 28, 38, 52. 52 points of damage.
Matt: 52 points? And what's the DC on your spell?
Felicia: It's no DC. It just hits.
Matt: Right, but it has a save.
Felicia: 17.
Matt: 17. Okay, it rolled a 15 plus five, so it is half damage, but that's still 26 points of damage to it.
Felicia: It's not bad.
Matt: (explosion noise) As you reach out, this arcing bead of red streaks through the darkness, impacts right at the side of the dragon's wing, and then (boof) bursts into a giant ball of flame. The whole cavern rocks from the sound of the impact. As the dragon pulls back, you can see this giant char mark on the outside of its wing. It's looking pretty rough. It's still standing, but it's looking pretty rough. Unfortunately, the radius of the blast, as it is a 20-foot radius, is large enough. Percy, his body is hit in the impact and blasted onto its back now. He rolls partly out of the impact--
Taliesin: Do I actually roll?
Matt: You actually (boof) over there. You're still technically in the same spot, but you're on your back now. You do automatically fail a death saving throw from that.
Felicia: Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
Matt: All right, that ends Lyra's turn. That brings us to the top. Percy. Make a saving throw. Just roll a ten or higher.
Taliesin: I did not roll a ten or higher.
Matt: You fail a second death saving throw.
Sam: Oh god!
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: (screams) Okay, here's the thing. Did he roll far enough away that he is not within ten feet of the dragon?
Matt: The dragon is ten feet up.
Laura: So he's far enough away.
Matt: In theory, he'd be just out of the way of a ten-foot radius. A 20-foot radius, no.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to Lightning Arrow the dragon.
Matt: Okay.
Felicia: Do you have a potion?
Travis: I do.
Taliesin: Grog's got it.
Laura: Do I have to attack? I do have to attack regular.
Matt: You do have to roll the attack, yes.
Laura: That's good. That's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Laura: Okay, so that is 4d8 against the dragon.
Matt: Yeah, 4d8 lightning damage. What's the DC on it?
Laura: 14.
Matt: 14? It does not make the save. Rolled a three.
Sam: Come on, Vex. Come on. Do it for Trinket.
Travis: Do it for Percy. Do it for Pike.
Taliesin: Let's not have another Pike, please.
Laura: 17.
Matt: Plus your Hunter's Mark.
Laura: That's good. That's another six for Hunter's Mark. Plus another 11.
Matt: Plus another 11. Okay. As the arrow releases, once again, (arrow flying) it turns into a bolt of pure arcane energy, smacking into the side of it. You can see the explosion hit and the energy crackle through the rest of its body. Its muscles shudder and it has to grasp the side of the top of this platform to keep itself steady. You can see now, the dragon's (heavy breathing). One eye is partially closed, and with each breath you can see this frost mist emanating from its breath. It looks like it's on its last legs.
Laura: For my second attack-- (cheering)
Laura: For my second attack, I'm going to regular attack him. Oh my god. Just going to regular attack him.
Matt: Roll for attack.
Laura: Jesus. Please. Oh! It's 30.
Matt: 30 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 13, 14, 15.
Matt: Including the Hunter's Mark?
Laura: No! Four.
Matt: Okay, so 19 total? Okay. As the arrow (arrow flying, impacts) embeds itself in the side of the neck, the dragon reaches up and it's scratching at the pain. As it pulls the arrow out, blood begins to pour down its side.
Laura: Ugh, he's still alive!
Matt: It's rough. That ends your turn.
Laura: Fuck! Is it his turn?
Matt: It is now Rimefang's turn. Rimefang turns. (heavy breaths, roars) and lets out a spray of icy damage out in this direction at an arc this way. I need to get a dexterity saving throw from Lyra, from Vex, and from Zahra.
Mary: Do I have a reaction?
Matt: After this, you will.
Mary: Okay, got it.
Felicia: Eight.
Matt: Eight?
Laura: 28.
Matt: 28. Okay. Zahra?
Mary: 11.
Matt: 11. Okay, so that is 54 points of damage to you.
Felicia: I'm down.
Matt: Lyra is currently (crackles) frozen in place right now from the blast. She's unconscious, and there is a coat of ice around her body holding her in place. How are you doing on hit points?
Laura: I'm at 28 hit points.
Matt: Okay, you kick the frost off, and you're on one knee. And you take 54 points of ice damage.
Laura: Are you unconscious, too?
Mary: Nope. I'm not. Do I have a reaction?
Matt: You have a reaction?
Mary: I do, I use Hellish Rebuke.
Sam: Oh! What is that? It sounds hellish.
Mary: I know. I get one per day.
Matt: All right, so the creature must make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: So it does it back to him?
Mary: Yes.
Matt: That is 15. What's the DC?
Mary: I don't know.
Laura: 17.
Mary: 17.
Matt: Okay, so it takes 2d10 fire damage. Go ahead and roll that.
Laura: Yes! Oh my god, you can kill it just because it attacked you?!
Taliesin: Kill it out of spite.
Felicia: Tell him he's very ugly.
Mary: Nine.
Matt: Nine points of fire damage? How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Mary: I don't know what that means!
Matt: How do you finish this dragon with your Hellish Rebuke?
Taliesin: Make it good!
Matt: After it finishes blasting you with ice damage, you watch the wizard frozen in place. You see Percy unconscious and bleeding on the ground. You see Vex on the ground, about to fall unconscious. Your friends are lost in the darkness around you, and suddenly you feel that tiefling surge of anger within you, and you?
Mary: Almost completely turn into flame as I walk towards it. Can I use anything?
Matt: How do you want the Hellish Rebuke to be?
Mary: I want this Hellish Rebuke to be me levitating in the air and using my dark dragon staff to blast it from here down, just eviscerating everything from the bowels down with hellish fire.
Matt: So after the frost takes on the front of you, and there is ice caked against the front of your armor, you suddenly look up at it and as your eyes flare with flame, the ice (shatters) evaporates from the sheer heat your body's emanating. You take a step forward, but the step itself is about an inch off the ground. A second step, you're two inches off the ground. And with each progressive step, you're slowly floating in the air, the warlock energy now swirling around you. The shadows are spinning around you and coalescing around your feet. As you look forward towards it, you see the portion of its armor that was blasted open earlier, with its flesh and sinew exposed. You take the staff forward, and with an angry snarl, the one last blast of infernal energy, the Hellish Rebuke then (shooting sound) sinking into the side of its chest. As the inside of its flesh begins to spark and smoke, the dragon (grunts) reaches out and grabs the side. It's beginning to try to bring its wings up to fly away, and as it does, (explosion noise) a blast of infernal flame comes cascading out of its chest. You can see now, all of its armor begins to peel back as its chest is blown open. Its eyes suddenly go from this piercing blue-white to a dull gray color, and it reaches out, and (heavy breathing) "No." It tumbles forward onto the ground next to Percy, almost crushing his unconscious form. It gets up, (impacts) takes two more steps forward. "No. You can't."
Mary: Yes, I fucking can! (cheering)
Matt: And with that, Rimefang falls dead to the ground. (cheering)
Sam: I run over to Lyra, cast Seeming on myself to give myself the appearance of Aldor, and I pour a potion into her mouth, and I wake her up.
Felicia: What happened?
Sam: You did good, baby.
Felicia: (gasps) And I'm just in him. (laughter)
Travis: I run over to Percy and pour a healing potion in his mouth, and I don't "in him." (laughter)
Matt: You can just barely get there with your movement. Thank god you're a barbarian.
Taliesin: Oh! What happened? Oh, look. It's dead!
Mary: Hello, Percy.
Laura: Oh my god. I stand up and I give Zahra a giant hug.
Taliesin: Can we cut that bastard up for scrap now? Ugh.
Laura: You were amazing.
Mary: Forever besties?
Felicia: Wait, then I notice. Aldor, why are you so short?
Sam: Baby. I can't change height, so I release Seeming and I'm back to normal.
Felicia: That was not as good a kiss as usual. I was worried, but it was special.
Travis: Oh! (laughter)
Mary: Is it time to take what we need from this thing?
Laura: Gather up all of the shit we have to take and put it in the bag of stuff.
Taliesin: That would be  two white dragon eyes, one white dragon tongue, one white dragon heart, six white dragon claws, and 20 white dragon teeth.
Matt: Who's harvesting this?
Mary: You have the bag.
Felicia: It's nature. Who has good animal handling?
Laura: Wait, we have to harvest it special?
Matt: Part of harvesting the organs from the creature is a delicate process.
Laura: Is it nature? What is it a check for?
Matt: It's a nature-based check, yes.
Laura: I have a low nature. What do you have?
Taliesin: Very low nature.
Mary: I have a six nature. Can I harvest him?
Matt: You can.
Travis: Can I go and loot the giant that's not frozen?
Matt: You can. You can also help with this roll.
Sam: Inspiration? Okay. I inspire them.
Matt: How do you inspire Zahra as she goes to start carving into this dragon?
Sam: I will sing something. I don't know what. I'm so out of it. We just killed a dragon! (laughter)
Sam: I go over to her and I'm like, (incoherent, impressed stammering). And that's all I got.
Matt: And with that, you killed a dragon.
Mary: It was a group effort.
Laura: Can I help at all? Can I assist? Can I hold her utensils for her?
Matt: Between the two of you working together, that would give you advantage on the checks. Which one are you going for first? Are you going for the eyes? Choose which portion you're harvesting first.
Laura: Everything. We need all of it, don't we?
Matt: Yeah, but which part are you harvesting first? You choose with each roll. You have eyes, heart--
Felicia: Can I assist? Can I help?
Matt: We already have an assist over there.
Felicia: I want to be helpful.
Laura: We'll all stand and watch.
Taliesin: Start with the eyes.
Laura: Pop them out. Pop those bitches out. But you get an advantage.
Matt: You will get advantage on it because she's assisting you.
Mary: That's nine plus--
Laura: Yeah, that's 15 plus six is 21.
Matt: 21. Okay. As you come over, using a dagger that you have. Pop very delicately each dragon eye out and place it into the satchel.
Laura: Into the cooler bag.
Matt: As you pull each eye out, it's like holding the coldest orb you've ever held. It actually burns your fingers as you clutch it. (gasp) Throw it inside and have to shake your hand off.
Laura: I jiggle them around in the bag. Just because.
Felicia: We have a special crate?
Laura: Yeah, I'm holding it.
Taliesin: The tongue would be next.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for that.
Laura: Plus another roll for advantage. Ooh, that's way better. Plus six. 23.
Matt: 23, all right. So you manage to, with the help of Vex pulling the jaw open, Grog holding onto the side, Lyra's supervising. You manage to get to the base of the tongue, carve off-- And you (slurp-pop) pull out the rather massive, very heavy tongue-- which, once again, this in itself, is like (yelps). Put it in real fast. And in the process of doing so, you suffer two points of cold damage, but the tongue has been harvested.
Taliesin: A heart.
Matt: This one's going to be difficult. Part of the chest is blown open, exposing the interior, but there has been damage done to the inside, so go ahead and attempt this.
Travis: Two rolls.
Mary: 12. 14. Plus six is 20.
Matt: Oh, 20! 20 is just what you needed. You pry in and crack open a portion of its body, and you begin to slowly carve out the portion, the heart, and the dragon heart itself is massive. It's huge, and it takes three of you to pull it out.
Laura: How do we fit it in this bag? Is it magic?
Matt: You don't know, but it's not going to fit in that satchel.
Mary: How heavy is it?
Matt: I'd say it probably weighs a good 200 pounds.
Felicia: I should know what people would do in the guild situation if they had an organ that wouldn't fit in the bag, right? We have to preserve it.
Matt: Travel back quickly or have preservation magic. Whether it would be a necromancy-based magic.
Felicia: Nope.
Travis: We're not shoving it in there? Are we cutting it in half?
Laura: We could roll it up in one of our fancy robes, though, and hold on to it. And pack it in-- oh, we, yeah! Let's chisel out some of the ice.
Matt: As you begin to wrap it up, you notice that the cold air begins to (cracking) crack around it, and the heart itself is freezing, as per the nature of a freshly dead white dragon. So it might be a good thing.
Laura: What about all this gold in the cavern?
Taliesin: Claws and teeth.
Mary: Teeth. Yes, roll to carve. Seven. 13.
Matt: 13. Going through the jaw, you begin plucking teeth out, piece by piece (cling, cling) and most of them, you notice, as part of the nature of the body, are beginning to decay faster than you expected. A lot of the teeth are becoming brittle and breaking, and as you start pulling them out, you're frustrated because with each one it seems to almost shatter as soon as you claw it from the jaw. By the end of it, you manage to gather about three dragon's teeth before the rest of them begin to break.
Travis: We have a shitload of dragon teeth left over.
Laura: But we need white dragon.
Travis: He was a white dragon!
Laura: Or wait, are you sure it wasn't the blue dragon that we harvested?
Travis: No, it was a white dragon, we have 37 left over.
Laura: Okay. We have 37 dragon teeth from the first white dragon.
Mary: Can I also get-- if there's any powder left or anything, for myself, I would like to--
Taliesin: Claws, still. We have to get claws still.
Mary: I know, but if it's on the ground, and it's in front of me, I would just like to put it in my little bag, to have it for my own spellcasting.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make a nature roll for that. Roll two more nature checks, or one more check, with advantage.
Laura: Another one.
Mary: That sucks, too. 13.
Matt: Okay. You managed to pull out some of the more sensitive parts of the dragon, but as you begin to cut away at some of the scales-- you're going for the scales or the claws?
Mary: I was going for the powdered-- the remains of whatever teeth that we couldn't get.
Matt: Oh, that! Never mind then, sorry. So then, that you can gather without a problem. It's powdered dragon ice bone, so yeah, that's fine. All right.
Taliesin: We still need claws.
Laura: Let's go for claws.
Travis: One more.
Mary: Nine. 15.
Matt: 15? In beginning to pull out the portions of its hands and getting the base of where the claw itself begins to grow, you manage to pull out five functional dragon claws without them breaking.
Mary: How many did we need, Percy?
Taliesin: Six. Do we have an extra? We have one?
Matt: You guys, prepared with your bag.
Mary: Hello! Prepared people!
Travis: Oh, I looted the giant.
Matt: All right, you looted the giant.
Mary: Now can we get some scales?
Laura: Just her? All of us?
Matt: All of you working together to get scales.
Felicia: All of us? Free for all?
Matt: Well, this is the roll they're making for it.
Laura: 20 for scales.
Matt: 20 for scales, okay. So all of you working together, you manage to pull off what amounts to about 25 pounds of dragon scales. Mind you, the scales are heavy and they're about that big each. It would be enough if you were to bring it to a master craftsman, to possibly construct a set of armor from them.
Laura: That's why we have so many pounds of dragon scales from the previous dragons! We could make three sets of armor right now.
Felicia: I'm going to look around and just see if there's a stash or a hoard that he was gathering.
Matt: All right, there are individual gold pieces embedded all through. It would take you weeks to chisel it all from the walls.
Mary: Are there any giant gems that we can see?
Matt: Everyone make a perception check.
Laura: I want to get my diamond back, too, from earlier.
Travis: Can I loot the bloody giant?
Laura: Natural 20 for perception! Ooh! Sparklies!
Matt: All right. So Grog. You go over to the giant that's not frozen. Looking at it, most of its armor itself is made for a giant's form, much larger than anything else, and a lot of it has been shredded by the dragon, or frozen and broken from the impact and you, cutting it apart with its axe. For the most part, all you're able to find off of its body are approximately 120 gold pieces, which isn't bad. Giants don't really carry a lot of money on them, usually what they carry on them is just trophies from battles they fought previously. At least, these ones here. What did you roll for perception?
Taliesin: 16.
Felicia: 18.
Sam: 11.
Mary: 13.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: So as you guys are looking around, the cavern seems to be fairly barren. You, however, Vex, as you walk to the back of the cavern, you see there are other pieces of partially eaten frozen bodies. And you, using a little bit of torchlight you can pull out, and glancing underneath, you see a little bit of shining, more of a cluster of shining about seven or eight inches beneath the ice surface. And you look down and you can see, there appears to be quite a hoard of something frozen beneath the surface of this cavern.
Felicia: Oh I can help! (blasting sounds) I throw a Fire Bolt.
Matt: (laughs) You start carving, you're like, (yelps). Dodge out of the way just in time as firebolts begin blasting the ice.
Felicia: 14. 14 points of damage.
Matt: (boom boom) A large chunk of the ice is blasted out from the Fire Bolt, and you catch your breath for a second. It's not enough to get all the way down, but it does manage to blast away a large portion of the ice.
Laura: I still have like two points of health, FYI.
Felicia: Oh! I'm sorry! You do look so lovely, though.
Matt: And so between the two of you guys, you take a dagger, you take your staff and you begin jamming into the ice. You manage to break it apart, and you do find beneath there, frozen, quite a hoard. You find over the next hour or so, 4,244 gold pieces--
Travis: Whoa!
Taliesin: Whoa!
Laura: How much?
Matt: 4,244 gold pieces. A cluster of gems worth around 850 gold. A singular diamond. It's about that large. It's actually a little bit smaller than the other one you have, but it's worth anywhere in the neighborhood of 1,200 gold pieces. You also manage to find a pair of leather gloves with almost gold trim around each one of the joints. You find what looks like a small leather cap that you pull over the head, that a peasant would wear, and what looks to be one glass vial containing an indeterminate liquid.
Laura: What is the color of the liquid?
Matt: From what you can look at the color, it's like a purplish-blue.
Mary: Can anybody do a perception check on magical liquid?
Travis: I would like to perception check the leather hat.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can anybody do an arcana check on the leather hat?
Matt: Oh. Do you have Detect Magic?
Travis: 16!
Matt: Or Identify spell?
Felicia: No. I thought about them.
Matt: Okay. Make an arcana check. Well, you guys have a brief rest here; it should be fine, actually. Okay. Looking at it, this is a very fancy leather hat.
Travis: It's a fancy leather hat. It's mine. Dibs!
Taliesin: I'm curious about the gloves, myself.
Matt: You take some time with each one of these items that you pull out from the ice, and each one emanates a magical aura from them. You take the gloves first and you look at them, and you eventually come to realize, oh, you've heard about this, you read about this in your books. These are Gloves of Missile Snaring. They're gloves that when worn, you have an opportunity to possibly snatch a missile out of the air. These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by a certain amount, provided you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to zero, you can catch the missile, midair, (whoosh) stop it from hitting you.
Taliesin: That might be good for you, though.
Laura: For anybody with ranged, probably.
Matt: Anybody who's hit by ranged.
Taliesin: I have a two-handed ranged weapon, though, which you do not.
Matt: Looking at the hat itself, while not a very impressive hat, the magical energy on it does give you the idea that it is used as an illusion-based magic. It is a Hat of Disguise. While wearing this hat you can use an action to cast the Disguise Self spell at will. It ends if the hat is removed.
Sam: May I have that one, please?
Taliesin: No, Scanlan.
Travis: What? He can already disappear.
Felicia: You'll abuse it. You've already abused that privilege already.
Sam: I'm sorry. By the way, your lips taste like bubblegum.
Matt: The potion is a Potion of Climbing. You can actually climb your walking speed for one hour.
Mary: Like Spider Climb?
Felicia: Spider Pig.
Mary: What's it called?
Matt: Climbing or scaling cliffs, you can go at the speed-- normally, you're very slow when you climb. You can just parkour up super fast. While this is happening, because you rolled a 20, you look over at the corpses that are frozen on the ground. You see one of the corpses is wielding a sword, and another one of the corpses appears to have a shattered bow in one hand. You go over and see the sword itself is not affected by the ice. It actually seems to be resisting the ice. You (cracking) break it out of the hand. The person who's holding the bow, currently, the upper torso is bitten off and shattered. Part of the body is ruined. The bow is broken and destroyed, but there is a quiver on its back. Within the quiver, you see most of the arrows are frozen solid within the quiver, but there is one that seems unaffected by the ice.
Laura: Can I tell what it is?
Matt: You pull out the arrow. It appears to be a deep forest green, and the actual shaft of the arrow has a texture to it, almost a rough metallic texture.
Sam: Take it!
Mary: Take it!
Travis: Take it!
Laura: I'm taking it! Are you kidding me?
Matt: If you wish to bring those over to Lyra. Lyra, make an arcana check.
Felicia: This is a very interesting arrow. I haven't seen one of these like this. Oh, wait, maybe I have. 27.
Matt: Good to know. You take the time with it. You immediately recognize, there is a similar enchantment on both of these weapons, and whoever came in here earlier had the intent of slaying this dragon and failed to do so. What you find is a Dragon-Slayer Longsword. Which is a plus-one weapon, normally, but against dragons or people of the dragon subtype, it deals an additional 3d6 damage with every hit.
Felicia: It's too bad it didn't work for them.
Matt: And an Arrow of Dragon-Slaying. It's a singular arrow, a one-use arrow, but if it hits a dragon of the dragon race, type, or group, it has to make a constitution saving throw or take an additional 6d10 piercing damage. It's a one-use, "fuck you, dragon" arrow.
Sam: 6d10?
Felicia: That's very pleasant.
Laura: Yeah, right? What is the saving throw?
Sam: You'll see. You're going to get the paper.
Matt: So at this point, you guys have taken probably a good hour and a half or so in this cavern. You start seeing water drip.
Laura: Oh, we should get out.
Matt: It's beginning to thaw in the absence of Rimefang.
Mary: Well, what's good is, I believe we're within the three days of the contract, yes?
Matt: Possibly.
Felicia: Well, we got the contract. We completed it within three days. Now, we have to get back.
Mary: Yes, we've killed it, so let's go home.
Matt: Percy, you go and you pull out the contract real fast to inspect it, and you can see that the arcane sigils that were built into it are faded, and where it looks like each piece of the dragon that you harvested correctly, has seemingly had a strange, glimmering gold shimmer from the actual text on the contract.
Laura: Lyra, they're going to love you.
Felicia: It's so exciting. I can't wait to go to the mess hall and tell everybody, many times, over and over, how this happened together. And you guys, this has been an amazing journey. Thank you.
Mary: I would like to take just one gold coin right at the base of the head of what was formerly Rimefang for myself. I'll put it in a necklace when we all go back to town.
Matt: All right. You take that one gold piece, pocket it. Take a moment to remember your final death blow against the dragon. You guys trek back through the caverns you arose, back through the ruined frost giant village, back into the Vesper Timberland, find where your horses were currently tied up, make your way back towards the city of Vasselheim. About a day and a half's worth of travel later, you notice that the blizzard that encompassed the six-mile radius of this mountain range has faded into a soft fog, and the actual weather in this area seems to have been connected to the presence of the dragon and is slowly dissipating. You eventually take yourself to the base of Vasselheim's main wall. You shout at the top of the wall, and noticing the group arriving, they let the doors open. You can see the giant, dragon-headed ballistae that line the city walls are armed and ready, and upon approval, they move them away. You enter the city, make your way through the Braving Grounds to the Quadroads to the outside of the Slayer's Take guildhall. As you enter the main room, you see Mertin is standing there. Looks like he's playing a game of solitaire with a deck of cards. He looks up. "Well, I'll be damned. Are you serious? You killed him?"
Felicia: Mertin, we did it.
Matt: "Show me your contract. Show me this contract."
Felicia: I don't know why you'd doubt us. Really, it's right here.
Matt: "Well done." And he puts his hand out to shake your hand.
Felicia: Oh my gosh. I start crying. This is the most proud moment of my life, Mertin. I've admired you for so long and the fact (cries) thank you. And then I just hug him.
Matt: Okay. He hugs you. "I appreciate it very much. You lost me 200 gold pieces, but well done. You've proven to be more than I expected. Let me get the Huntmistress. She will be very happy to see that you've arrived. Aye, my wife. Yes." And he gets up and leaves. A few moments later, the headmaster Vanessa Cyndrial comes in, her tiefling self with her horns curled behind her head. Walks in with this smooth glare. "I must say. Some of these contracts we put out as a test of your power and will, and to be perfectly honest, I was pulling for you." She puts out her hand and her husband takes a pouch of coin and puts it in her hand. She takes it and puts it on the side of her belt. "I'm impressed by all of you, and by this token, and by the completed contract. First off, you have definitely proven your worth to the Slayer's Take."
Felicia: Oh my god, that is so sweet, Vanessa.
Matt: "Keep the emotions in check. We have to put up a face here. No one wants to see a member of the guild cry. Now, for the rest of you, I would like to humbly ask if you wish to join the Slayer's Take guild."
Sam: Yeah, sure, that'll work. The bear, too?
Matt: "The bear, as well. Best not show him the back room. We have a few trophies back there that might freak him out."
Travis: Do we get to work with another leader next time?
Sam: What? Because if the answer is yes, we refuse. This is our leader from now on.
Felicia: Thank you so much.
Matt: "You are able to choose what your group is at any time. Whatever the contract requires."
Felicia: I really appreciate it, but given the kiss that we had, I realized why Aldor doesn't love me is that I don't have enough experience. Sexually. So I'm going to stay in town to spread my wings in that area. And then he'll love me. Won't he, Vanessa?
Matt: Vanessa goes, "Lyra, I would recommend this course of action to not be taken. I would think that would reflect poorly-- I mean, your personal time is your own, but nevertheless, my dear, this is a very pious house--"
Sam: I think this is a great idea.
Felicia: Oh, no. Not you. You're such a friend to me. I can't ruin that.
Sam: You're right.
Matt: Vanessa walks up and puts her hand on your shoulder and goes, "We're going to have a talk, woman to woman."
Felicia: (whispers) Oh my god, you guys, I'm in!
Mary: Be straight with her, will you? Please.
Matt: "I'm going to make sure she doesn't embarrass the rest of us. So with the contract completed, provide what you've harvested from your quarry, and payment will be delivered."
Laura: I put the bag down that's got all the stuff in it. And then we take out a couple from the white dragon, and put out the other stuff. And we've got this giant heart right here.
Matt: The heart, which Grog has been carrying on his back as you guys travel. (impact sound) It hits the table and the wood cracks a little bit beneath it from the impact. And you can see, the ice is starting to melt a bit on the exterior.
Laura: Careful, it needs to be preserved.
Matt: She gives a nod. "Very well. Mertin, please, provide these for transport to the contract client."
Mary: Can we ask who actually contracted it?
Matt: "It's written on the contract itself."
Mary: Oh, that's right. I'm so sorry.
Matt: Percy has the contract, currently.
Taliesin: I do. Ozwyn Grud?
Travis: Grundle?
Felicia: Alchemist Ozwyn Grud.
Matt: Make a history check, by the way.
Taliesin: May I, as well?
Felicia: 21.
Taliesin: 25.
Travis: Oh, a history check? Four. He's a person.
Mary: I had four, as well. We are so getting shots later. Like, now.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: All right. The two of you immediately go, "Huh," and it hits you: you've heard the name before. You've heard the name and you're trying to figure out where it is. You pick it up and say, "He's a member of the Arcana Pansophical." It's a really exclusive group of archmages across the entire globe that essentially work together to keep the peace on a global scale. Of which, you know that Arcanist Allura Vysoren is a member of the Arcana Pansophical.
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Matt: This is another member of that team, who ordered this.
Taliesin: This is most likely going to good use, at the very least.
Sam: So do we collect our money?
Matt: "Indeed. What is the total on that contract, if you don't mind repeating?"
Taliesin: I was just working that out.
Laura: Lots of gold.
Taliesin: Lots of gold. It's 1,800 for the dragon eyes, 1,200 for the dragon tongue. 3,500 for the heart. 1,500 for the claws, and then how much for the dragon teeth?
Laura: Per dragon's tooth? Or for all six dragon teeth?
Taliesin: For all 20 dragon teeth.
Matt: Yeah. Essentially, considering the dragon teeth that you had already stored, those are used in this transaction, as well as the claws. So you no longer have dragon's teeth and dragon claws stored in your bag. However, you've fulfilled the contract and get full payment for those.
Travis: We have 12 teeth left.
Sam: So it's 9,000 total?
Taliesin: 9,000 total.
Matt: "9,000 gold pieces." She reaches beneath, pulls out a small chest. You see her do something beneath the table you don't recognize, and all of a sudden you hear a clicking sound and she pulls up three large sacks of gold (heavy impacts) on the table. "Divide as you see fit. On top of this, as you have now been accepted to this, when your other team members arrive, which should be any moment now, in the next day or so, you'll be inducted, you'll be absolved of your breach of the laws of Vasselheim, and you will also acquire a small payment in conjunction with the hydra contract. So we will discuss this as soon as your friends arrive. Until then, feel free to rest, divide the gold, and be on your way."
Laura: That's 1,500 each.
Sam: Thank you.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Felicia: Oh, I don't need any. (laughs)
Laura: What about you, Zahra?
Mary: Oh, I need. I'll take, definitely. Thank you.
Matt: "You do not need your money? Well, that will go back to the guild, thank you."
Travis: No, she misspoke.
Mary: She misspoke. I'm so sorry. She completely misspoke.
Matt: (chuckles) "Very well." Tosses the coins.
Laura: 1,800 each.
Matt: "Well done. Congratulations, and I look forward to a very fruitful and profitable future together here at the Slayer's Take."
Travis: Aye. Scanlan, should we go and make sure that your wounds are completely healed?
Laura: Can we insight check Vanessa really fast?
Matt: You may. What are you trying to gather?
Laura: Just to see what kind of person she is.
Matt: All right, go for an insight check.
Laura: 24.
Matt: Okay. You know you have a very strong sense of being able to read a person, and yet she is still an enigma to you. She seems earnest. She seems definitely a shrewd businesswoman, and there's a reason this guild has been successful for as long as she's been at the helm of it. But as far as reading her intent? She seems very guarded and hard to read. You're unable to really catch a bead on her.
Felicia: Vanessa, I want to thank you for trusting me with this very difficult task. I know that you sent some other people after this dragon, and your confidence in our abilities over theirs, who were defeated? It's just fantastic. I mean, what were you thinking?
Travis: What were you thinking?
Taliesin: What were you thinking, really?
Matt: "Well, to be perfectly honest, this dragon had been a thorn in our side, with previous contracts failed on its side, and you all seemed so confident in your skills. I figured it would be a good excuse for you to either flee from this thing and come back with your tail between your legs, or be foolish and get yourself killed, in which case, you're not a problem of ours anymore and everything's fine. Or, best case scenario, what you've shown to me today."
Laura: Which is that we're amazing.
Travis: Vox Machina does not flee.
Mary: Never. Although I'm not a part of it.
Sam: We'll make you an honorary member.
Matt: "Anyway, I have business to attend to. Enjoy your night. Celebrate. And return here when you wish to see your friends hopefully return as successful as you were."
Sam: Thank you.
Mary: Thank you.
Travis: We are sure they will.
Matt: "Mertin!" "Yes, I know, my dear. I'm taking it." And he takes the heart and (grunts) lifts it over his back and the halfling, as thick as he is, (grunts) is bringing it to the back room. She turns around, gathers the rest of the materials into a sack, and exits the room. And with that, we will conclude tonight's session. Well done!
Sam: We did it!
Mary: We survived!
Laura: Good job, Mary!
Matt: By the way, these are your magical items. You want to go ahead and take those?
Sam: I have to split.
Taliesin: Yes, you're moving.
Felicia: Tonight?
Taliesin: Tomorrow.
Felicia: Oh my goodness.
Matt: First off, guys, a big round of applause and appreciation for our guests. Mary, Felicia. You guys were fantastic.
Taliesin: Guest dragon kill.
Felicia: That was very fun. Thank you for letting me guest and be on the Twitch channel. You guys are a joy to have. I'm so proud to be part of the Geek and Sundry family.
Mary: I would like to say thank you so much to the community, to the Critters out there. I've never felt so much love overnight and through this last week. You inspired me today, and all of us, so thank you so much.
Zac: Speaking of Critters, #CriticalRole is officially trending on Twitter right now on the front page. You guys should all keep that trend going and go tell us what you think about the show and your favorite moments from tonight with #CriticalRole, @GeekandSundry. A couple of other quick announcements. Thank you, Felicia, for coming out. She's about to leave for a month, right?
Felicia: I'm going on a book tour, so please, if you haven't, preorder my book. feliciadaybook.com. I'm going to 12 cities, then DragonCon. I'm pretty excited about it. I'm going all over. I'm sorry, Midwest. It'll be fun.
Zac: Speaking of her book, guys, we are 60 subscribers away, roughly, from doing another signed book giveaway. Subs are what keep this channel alive. We wouldn't be able to bring you this content without subscribers, so let's try to get that 60 before we're done reading all our donations and prizes and everything else. But actually, I think we're going to play that video of Felicia one more time really quick to support her book tour.
Felicia: That's very sweet.
Zac: We'll be right back, really quick, with our donations and everything.
Matt: Yes. [end captions]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, and welcome this evening to Critical Role, everyone. A show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons and have a good time. Guess we can go ahead and-- we forgot to do the format this time and start with the intro. We trying to do that going forward because it makes more sense. But for now, let's go ahead and jump to the intro and we'll be right back to describe what we have going on. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So first and foremost, we got a couple quick announcements to get into for this week. For every 100 subs we get to the channel this evening we'll be doing giveaways. The giveaways this week will include a signed photo of the cast of Critical Role, as well as, for the first time offering, a large print poster of one of the classic moments within our campaign drawn by our illustrious Kit Buss, our official artist for Critical Role. I think Zac should be showing you that photo that we'll be giving away, a really nice, high-quality print of that signed by the cast. And we'll send that out to whoever wins the wonderful prize for the chat room. I think we're 50 away from our first giveaway. So, you got to get that climbing so we can give that out shortly. Also, as we've previously, the past two weeks, had some great guests joining our first half of the Vox Machina group on their adventure, this week we have two new guests joining us for this and next week. If I can have a big, warm welcome to our players this week: Wil Wheaton and Will Friedle. Thank you guys so much for joining us. Excited to have you.
Marisha: So awesome.
Will: Slightly nervous.
Wil: You're going to be great, don't worry about it. I want to apologize in advance to Liam for having to share a table with me. I'm sorry for what's going to happen to your dice on account of how close we are to each other. I hope you're not too attached to anything with your character at all. (laughter)
Wil: I know. I'm just telling you, if there's dice you really love, you might want to put them away.
Liam: I'll just kiester this one.
Matt: That's the most comfortable way to do that. Well, awesome guys. Thank you so much for joining us in this. Before we jump in, let's see if we have any announcements that anyone wants to make, anything coming up, anything you want to talk about. I'll start. I'll say that as of flying out this evening, I should say, I have a flight at 12:15 from LAX. I'll be flying out to Columbus, Ohio for Matsuricon this weekend. So, any of you guys out there in the Ohio area want to come and visit me for the weekend, I'll be doing signings, panels, and general hanging out with fans and stuff. So if you're in the vicinity, come say hi. That's my announcement. Anyone else have anything they want to mention?
Orion: Yeah. I recently started my own Twitch stream. So you can follow me and watch. I play a lot of video games, guys. It's horrible addiction that's amazing. But it's @orionacaba on Twitch.
Matt: You keep streaming Thursdays at 7 00, which I think is really counterproductive.
Orion: It's weird.
Wil: When you've mastered being in two places at once, it's silly not to take advantage of it.
Orion: I am actually hosting Geek and Sundry on my channel right now.
Matt: Oh, look at you.
Liam: Are you simultaneously brewing at home right now?
Wil: I am. And I am also running this game in an alternate universe.
Liam: Oh. Wow.
Wil: It's pretty great. Yeah. And Matt rolls so bad in that game. It's really great. I am having dinner with my wife tomorrow so I'm looking forward to that. We're probably going to put a whole chicken in the smoker in the afternoon and then I think we're going to play some games. I'm introducing her to a game that I got at Gen Con called Lanterns.
Marisha: Lanterns?
Wil: Yeah, really fun Dom Lux game. Really like it a lot.
Marisha: We'll have to check that out.
Will: I, after four lovely years, popped the question last week.
Matt: Yes, you did.
Will: And I am engaged to be married. Yes. (cheering)
Will: Thank you very much.
Matt: I would say Susan's a very lucky girl, but really, it's the other way around.
Will: No, I'm the lucky one. I lucked out. I really was the one who lucked out.
Liam: Does she know or is this the proposal?
Will: I was going to propose like this, but we live in the woods and we don't get this show there. We have no internet whatsoever. No, she knows. She knows. She stupidly said yes, so we'll see what happens next.
Wil: If you need an entree into the Society of Men Who Married Way Above Their Stations, I can provide you an introduction.
Will: Thank you. (laughs) That's awesome. Yes, that is absolutely what happened here, so I will need that.
Wil: Yeah, they're members-only jackets.
Marisha: Members-only jackets.
Wil: The sleeves are little too short on all of the jackets, so we remember.
Will: That's perfect. I like that.
Matt: A lot of suede.
Will: Yeah. (laughter)
Wil: Yeah. (laughter)
Wil: And a nylon hood zipped into the neck, for some reason.
Matt: Which no one ever uses, and you forget it's there until you're like, "What's that? Oh, right." Congratulations.
Will: Thank you. You are the first to know that that's happened.
Matt: There you go. Exclusive. Critical Role exclusive. Well, fantastic. Let's go ahead and jump into where we left off.
Wil: I thought I just heard you say you need a pencil.
Orion: Yeah, I do.
Will: That's what happens when you're in multiple places at once. The realities start blending.
Will: I'll share, if you'd like.
Orion: Thank you.
Matt: Anyone else need a pencil? Everyone good?
Will: That was a good throw and catch.
Wil: I have a mechanical pencil that looks like a pencil pencil.
Will: I think I have the same kind of pencil.
Wil: Yeah, it's nice.
Marisha: We do the hand-eye coordination thing.
Matt: All righty, guys. As it currently stands, Vox Machina throughout its ventures found itself in the city of Vasselheim, as of late. They came to seal away the Horn of Orcus they had tore from the head of the beholder K'Varn deep in the Underdark. Once they had completed this journey, they spent some time in the city trying to figure out what can be done there, preparation for possibly Keyleth making a venture out to one of her Ashari tribes. During which, Grog entered a fight ring and lost. And the party decided to go ahead and--
Marisha: Never forget.
Matt: I have a feeling Kern and Grog are going to have a round two in the near future, depending on how Grog's feeling about that. Then the party saw that there was some sort of hydra-like being that had been harrying the walls of the outskirts of the city of Vasselheim. Being the adventurers they are, they took it upon themselves to leap out into the jungles and the forests of the Vesper Timberland. Found and hunted down this hydra, fought it, and upon slaying it, discovered there was another group also hunting this hydra. An actually sanctioned group. And that hunting this hydra is considered illegal in Vasselheim unless you had actually been contracted to do so. So in breaking the laws of Vasselheim, they could have been tried for it, but instead chose to return to the city with this group of hunters and be brought before their guildmaster, the Huntmaster known as Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial. Basically, they were given the choice: they could go to trial or they could undergo their own personal trial to join the guild, the Slayer's Take, which is essentially a guild that takes on contracts to hunt various requested creatures down, harvest elements of their physical bodies to then be sold or returned to these individuals and be paid for it. If they manage to complete these trials, they will be absolved of breaking the law because they will now be within the confines of it and will be members of the guild. So choosing that, they were then also notified that they would be splitting up into two different groups, much to the chagrin of Vex and Vax, our twins.
Will: Split apart.
Liam: Separation anxiety is a real thing.
Matt: So this group, the second adventuring group, has gathered itself back to the Bellows' Respite inn. Vax, you were asked to go the bar, to join your sister, Vex, for a shot of the hardest liquor they had available to deal with the coming separation. You shared a brief breakfast, shared your bitter, spiteful, alcoholic imbibement, and then went your separate ways. The first group went initially, and it's been about an hour or so of you guys waiting in the tavern for them to, as far as you know, take care of their business before you were to go to the guild yourselves. So, we have Tiberius, Keyleth, and Vax all sitting around the Bellows' Respite tavern lamenting what's going to come next.
Orion: Oh, cheer up, Vax. She'll be back soon. I've never seen you quite so down.
Marisha: I've been separated from my parents for a really long time. You get used to it. It's not too bad.
Liam: It took you years to do that. I'm two minutes in, so I'll grieve a little bit longer.
Marisha: Don't say the word grieve. That's strong.
Orion: Yes, it's implying that someone has died. And no one has. So, you know.
Marisha: It's only a few days. It'll be good. Separation makes the heart grow fonder and all that stuff.
Liam: It's fine. I just have a low tolerance for bullshit, and I'd like to get past this little piece of shit that we're being made to swallow.
Orion: I agree. Stormwinds should not be meddling around with these peasants. Are we in a tavern?
Matt: You are currently in the Bellows' Respite Tavern.
Orion: Barkeep, bring me your finest ale for my friend here and for the lady. I'll take a water.
Matt: The relatively jovial, ginger-bearded, rotund human gentleman who runs the establishment comes over to you. Looks like himself is a little bleary-eyed and hasn't quite adjusted to the morning light itself. "Oh okay. Certainly, I'll go ahead and retrieve that for you. It's three? Three is what I'm looking at?"
Marisha: What time is it?
Matt: Right now, I'd say it's roughly 9 00 to 10:00 in the morning.
Marisha: Oh sure. Let's start early. Why not?
Orion: And I flip him a couple of gold coins.
Matt: He tries to catch it, fumbles. Goes and pick it up.
Marisha: Don't throw. That's rude.
Matt: Five minutes go by. Your food and drink are brought to your table, and you continue to lament about the coming time. Is there anything else you guys wish to take care of before you make your way to the Slayer's Take Guildhall?
Marisha: Well, since we're getting separated, Grog is taking the Bag of Holding.
Orion: I have one; don't forget that.
Marisha: Right, but we had a lot of stuff in that Bag of Holding. I kept most of the stuff that I needed on me, but how many healing potions do we have?
Liam: Not a lot. That's what I'm concerned about. We lost our meat shield and we don't have Pike. So I think we probably need to go and get some potions.
Marisha: I can go ahead and brush up on healing spells, as well. Make sure I come a little bit more well-equipped, just in case.
Orion: I'm good on potions, but we should restock our supply.
Liam: How many have you got?
Orion: I have, let me see here, three potions of greater healing, and three regular potions of healing.
Liam: Can I have one?
Orion: I suppose. If we're just going to buy more, it doesn't matter. But just in case something happens along the way.
Liam: Thank you.
Marisha: I only have one greater healing potion right now.
Orion: Yes, so we'll go buy more. And then we'll see what else they have. I would like to see if we can procure a couple of items, like a couple of empty vials. I've used a lot of mine. Maybe find some acid or whatnot at these item shops. So let's look around and get the stuff.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Marisha: Apparently we have the flying carpet?
Liam: Do we have the flying carpet?
Matt: The flying carpet is, for the most part, kept wrapped up in Grog's Bag of Holding.
Marisha: Because I think Grog was checking out. He's breaking up a little bit. But I feel like he just told me that we took the flying carpet.
Liam: (imitating Grog) We took the flying carpet. Sorry.
Marisha: He's very far away, but I feel it's reaching its limits.
Liam: (imitating Grog) I would like to bogart the flying carpet and everything in the fucking Bag.
Marisha: He apparently left us with the flying carpet?
Orion: He's saying he left with the flying carpet, Keyleth. He left with it. We don't have it.
Marisha: He said, remember, you took the flying carpet. To break RP for a second.
Liam: (imitating Grog) Am I texting you that right now?
Marisha: Yeah. I can't. You're cutting out. You're cutting out, Grog.
Orion: I held it for a time, but I only have my Wheel of Mending in mine, as far as I know. Hold on, let me check.
Matt: As you reach into your Bag of Holding--
Orion: I'm thinking really hard.
Matt: Through the luck of the draw, it seems to be that the last resting place of the flying carpet was within your Bag of Holding.
Orion: Hold on. Oh here it is.
Marisha: Oh, look at that. We have it.
Orion: Shut my mouth. I guess I was wrong.
Marisha: Found it. We're good.
Liam: All right, let's go to the store. I don't really want to drag this out any longer than we have to. And I walk out the door and start going.
Matt: Okay. What did you roll for your investigation check, Tiberius?
Orion: 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. As you guys take the next 20 minutes wandering the Quad Roads district of Vasselheim, asking around. A lot of the shops here offer general supplies. There are a few that are focused on the mining supplies as there is a large market mining cobalt out of the center of the mountain the city is built around. You find places that provide clockwork for large grandfather clocks that are starting to be distributed in this part of the city. You also find that there is a large bazaar-type market in the center of the Quad Roads that you passed by when you first came to town. Amongst many of these barkers, you do catch one small tent, Tiberius, that catches your eye because it resembles the same purple color as one tent you guys entered in Emon about a year or so ago, in which you encountered a fortune teller.
Marisha: Oh shit! It's the Witch's Fortune. What are you looking for?
Liam: Look at those fingers fly.
Orion: I approach.
Marisha: Do you know her name? Remember her name? I can probably find it. It would take a minute of digging, through. Hang on. I've got to go back to my old notes. I've got to go back to my old D&D notes. Keep doing stuff.
Matt: So as you enter the tent, you pull the curtains apart. There is one other individual who seems to be just perusing the interior. But the smell that hits you immediately is very heavy sage, ceremonial burning of various spices, giving the area a mystical scent. The light itself is very low, just a few flickering candles and a hooded lantern in the far corner directed outward give a bit of ambiance to the interior of the tent. The series of small ropes and cords made of hemp and silk carry trinkets and bones and various enchanted accoutrements. And in the far back corner, amongst the table there is indeed a very beautiful elven woman dressed in a fine silk gown with a metallic headband, her dirty blonde hair behind her ears. And she looks to be in the middle of shuffling a deck of tarot cards. As you enter, she looks up and gives you a look of surprise and then a curious look of remembrance.
Marisha: Am I with him?
Matt: You're behind him and outside of the tent. He entered. Did you guys want to go in with him?
Liam: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All right, you enter and are greeted by this same atmosphere.
Marisha: (gasps) Trista!
Matt: She gives you a cross look.
Marisha: It's been so long! Fancy meeting you here.
Matt: She puts her finger up for a second, turns over to the noblewoman who is currently perusing this small shelf of books and tomes. "I'm terribly sorry. Would you mind just giving us a moment? I've some personal business to attend to." The noble woman is like, "Oh, fine. I didn't want to purchase anything anyway." And stomps out of the tent. The door closes behind her. At which point the elven woman immediately turns. "Trista's my sister."
Marisha: You're Forsythia?
Matt: "It's good to see you again, young half-elf." You can see now with the current atmosphere, the light seems to dim the interior of the tent. And the elven woman's visage shimmers and then fades and there sitting behind the table you see a large, hunched forward, gnarled humanoid. This woman, who is definitively referred to as a hag, is currently lording over the table, long, twisted fingers holding that same deck of cards. Looking up at you with a crooked nose and pointed chin. There's a grin on her face. And looks to you and, "It has been some time, dragonborn. I can still see there is a fraction of you still missing."
Orion: Yes. I still don't know what that means. But I am actually happy to see you, milady.
Matt: Still shuffling her cards. "So was there anything I can help you with?"
Orion: Yes. Yes, there is. You mentioned before, when I asked you last, of the Boros Ring. You revealed that it was in the Fey, the Wild Fen. I am also in search of the item that I did not get to ask you about called the Pale Stone. I wish to know the location of that, as well.
Matt: She gives you a keen look. "I think for the time being, one quest is enough. Return when you've procured this ring you so graciously seek, then perhaps the rest of this will be revealed. Grow greedy with fate and I fear the timeline will swallow you up, young dragonblood." She pulls the cards down and just starts going over her own reading. Each card she slams down with a heavy thud. The room seems to almost cloud, the air growing thicker. And there's a hint of frustration that she's currently being bothered and strung out. After she takes a few moments to herself, she looks back you. "Is there business you seek, aside from asking me these questions? Perhaps a bauble or two. I make fine baubles."
Orion: Since you're not in the business of information, then we are in the business of procuring some specific items. Potions. I'm looking for a few empty glass vials. Perhaps some acid, if you have it.
Matt: She stands up. And as she stands up, you can now see the hag, which hunched forward, sits at a solid five feet tall. At full height, even with the hunch, she's now cresting the top of the tent at seven feet. Long, stringy, gray-black hair framing the shoulders. The same nice goldish silk outfit the elf appearance was wearing is there. It looks much more world-tattered and matches the one currently wearing it. She reaches behind her, still staring you intently in the face, and grabs a small case off the wall. Sets it down before her. Pulls back the wooden lid and inside, you can see there are three small glass vials. "These are what I have to offer. Two of them will right your physical form, perhaps take care of some of those wounds someone as foolish and careless as you eventually deal with. The third one is caustic in its nature. Its application is up to you. They are sold as a set, though. 300 gold pieces. Take it or leave."
Orion: You don't have to be all nasty about it. I have the money. Here you go.
Matt: She reaches over and as you hold the small bag of coin out, her hand completely engulfs yours. The fingers wrap around, and for a second you feel a tug. And you are awkwardly pulled forward a few inches. You get closer to her face. The breath catches your nostrils, the scent of swamp water and old fish. It's a moment of intensity where you forget your surroundings for a brief moment. And it's just you and this entity. And you realize, she's far older than you ever gave her credit for. She pulls the bag of coin from your hand and withdraws. The light seems to return from the peripheral of your vision. Keyleth and Vax are there at your side. She reaches forward and pushes the box forward toward you on the table. "Be safe, and may fortune smile upon most of you."
Orion: Yes, I know something bad is going to happen. I show them the box. I take it and pick it up. This is all she had to offer. She's not taking questions.
Marisha: You're not taking any questions right now?
Matt: "Not today."
Marisha: Not today?
Matt: "As you know, my dealings with fate take a lot out of me. I'm not quite ready for another round of tellings. You see, this city, as most bits of civilization, are very eager to hear what the future has in store for them. So I'm a bit tapped out at the moment." And you can see a bit of dried blood around one of her nostrils. And if you recall last time, the process was very physically taxing on her. "Perhaps return in a week or so. And if I'm not here, I'm around."
Liam: Old one, are you still willing to trade today?
Matt: "Trade?"
Liam: I'm wondering if you have any poisons beyond the run-of-the-mill nightshades this afternoon or morning?
Matt: She stands up and reaches over, and there's a small alchemical glassware set up on the side. And you see it's cracked and old and it's been brutalized. And she pulls a very small vial of some dark, black, almost umbra-type liquid where you can't even see shine in the light. It absorbs all the light. She puts it forward. "This would be very unfortunate to find its way into the bloodstream of an enemy, yes?"
Liam: What do you want for it?
Matt: "A favor. Not now, but perhaps down the road."
Orion: She does that, Vax. A lot.
Liam: Why not?
Matt: She pushes it forward with her long, crooked fingernail, shoves the vial forward. It screeches across the top of the table. She withdraws her hand. "So it is done." At that moment, there's a very a cold shiver down the back of your neck that then fades. She just grins with this nasty, toothy grin. "Now, be on your way. I have cards to shuffle."
Liam: Yoink.
Marisha: It was so nice to see a familiar face in such a strange place. She's lovely.
Orion: Yes. Good day, madam.
Matt: As you step out, she raises her hand in front of her and her form once again shimmers and shifts down to that beautiful elven maiden that greeted you as you entered. The lights tend to blossom a little bit and you close the tent behind you.
Liam: As we're leaving, I say, that's a good look.
Matt: Gives a slight breathy chuckle that starts beautiful. (chuckle turns into a cackle)
Orion: What did we actually get?
Matt: You acquired two potions of greater healing, and a vial of caustic liquid. You are uncertain as to what its properties are.
Marisha: Caustic liquid.
Matt: You also don't quite know the properties of yours, but you gather, the assurance from a creature of this power, that she speaks in riddles, but not in untruths.
Orion: I'm going to give you another one of the greater potions. So mark that down.
Liam: Thank you. We're right in the middle of the bazaar. Do we want to take a quick jog around? I grab someone passing by and say, you, potions? Where? Here?
Matt: The person looks down at your arm, brushes it off, and the middle-aged gentleman goes, "Sir, you do realize that most of the potion trade is controlled by the clergy?"
Marisha: They're all like no magic and stuff here.
Liam: I did not know that. Thank you. Well, shit.
Marisha: Wait. Did he say that it was controlled by the clergy?
Orion: So we should go there.
Marisha: Hang on. Just because it is controlled by the clergy doesn't mean that it's legal. Doesn't mean that if we go knocking on their door requesting potions that they're going to take kindly to that. Kind of like getting your concealed deadly weapons license in certain places.
Liam: I grab another weirdo passing by and say, excuse me. There's probably a temple around here. Can you point us in the right direction?
Matt: The individual looks at you awkwardly and points over. And you can see just past the outskirts of this bazaar, there are a number of buildings that line the outer area of this central portion. You can see where he is pointing, there is a large cathedral made of almost, from this distance, a warbling, warped obsidian, and it is far more ominous and obelisk-like in appearance than the other temples. In a district of the city that you haven't been to yet. But it is the closest temple.
Wil: Warbling Obsidian is my Black Crowes cover band.
Liam: I'm getting itchy. Can we just go to the Take please?
Marisha: I turn and I lean into Tiberius and I say, he's going to be cranky the entire time we're on this field trip, isn't he?
Orion: Yes, and usually I'm the cranky one.
Marisha: I know.
Orion: So let's head to the temple. Right? Yes?
Marisha: I guess.
Orion: Can you turn into a horse?
Marisha: Yes, but that's a little forward, don't you think?
Orion: I'm just asking.
Liam: Are we going to the temple or the Take?
Orion: Oh, the Take? What would make you feel better?
Liam: Let's get on with it, shall we? Jesus, whoever that is.
Orion: That was that one carpenter we met in in Vasselheim.
Liam: Oh, he was sweet. He had some good herb.
Orion: Yes, he did. He sure knew how to-- it was dank.
Matt: "Dank," which is arcane terms for "thaumaturgical." Anyway. You make your way to the southern outskirts of this portion of the bazaar, which leads its way into the central building cluster portion of the Quad Roads district to the outside of the Slayer's Take Guildhall. You walk up to the main doorway which has the inscription in front. And pushing the door open, you enter into the main foyer area, where you see the same cast-iron chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the dark wood rafters frame the entire internal area. And there sitting at the central desk is Mertin, the scarred-up halfling with the relatively joyful disposition. He looks up from his books. "Okay, it appears to me that we have the other half of this adventuring group to deal with. Let us hope that perhaps you have better luck than your previous friends in what has been chosen for you, eh?"
Liam: They already headed out?
Matt: "Yes, they left not more than an hour ago, I imagine."
Marisha: And what were they contracted with?
Matt: "Oh, nothing. They're going to kill a dragon. Would you like me to go get the mistress for you?"
Liam: Excuse me?
Matt: "I'll take that as a yes. I'll be right back." And he gets up from his table and wanders off.
Orion: They'll be fine. I'm sure of it. Scanlan makes good decisions all the time.
Matt: As you wait a few moments, eventually Mertin returns. But he seems, his head down, a little humbly, and gestures out with his hands. And you hear the familiar footsteps of the Huntmaster, Vanessa Cyndrial. Her tiefling appearance both very striking in her chiseled bone structure in her face, her dark leather armor itself creaking slightly with each footstep. And she has that very commanding yet welcoming appearance, which you know hides a very hard-to-read interior. She steps forward. "Well, are you ready to take on the other half of this mission? Your friends were eager. And they traveled with some of our finer warriors. Are you confident in your capabilities today?"
Orion: Listen, don't be smug with me. None of us what to be here or cooperate with this stupid event just to abide your laws.
Marisha: Tiberius, we could be on trial.
Orion: The answer is yes. Let's get on with it.
Matt: "You see, it is very simple. I like it, direct and to the point. I respect that."
Orion: Oh. Well, thank you.
Matt: "The angry, flowery part in the middle, not so much a fan of. All right. So," she reaches behind and pulls out what looks like a small, rolled-up piece of parchment. Looks at it for a second. "Well, you have one other hopeful for this guild that will be joining you for this, and a leader will be assigned to you on this excursion to keep an eye on you and make sure you stay within the rules and not go absconding to some other country and we have to hunt you down."
Liam: Fantastic.
Orion: Can we use the word liaison?
Matt: "A liaison, if you will. Mertin, would you get the other hopeful for this?" Mertin says, "Of course, my lady." He gets up, and walks over, and knocks on a door. As you hear the door knock on the opposite side of the room, opens it up. And the red, tousled hair, halfling. "Kashaw, your group has arrived."
Will: Well, it's about time. I'm sick of waiting. (sighs) He walks out and meets everybody.
Matt: As you guys look, the door opens, and a human male steps out into the light. If you wish to describe yourself.
Will: I am Kashaw Vesh, an acolyte. Here I am, waiting for you for so long now. Do I have to travel with them the entire time?
Matt: "For the remainder of this contract at least. But once you have joined the Guild, perhaps other groups will be assigned to you."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, were we late? We didn't mean to keep you waiting. Or do you mean like, you've been waiting for us for a long time in the destiny, "we're here and where have you been my whole life" kind of way?
Will: Is she always like this?
Orion: Yes, she is.
Liam: Not good at reading emotions.
Will: This is going to be fun. Yes. No, I meant you're late.
Marisha: Wait. Is that what people say about me?
Liam: I don't.
Marisha: We'll talk later.
Will: Who are you?
Liam: Vax'ildan.
Orion: I am Tiberius Stormwind.
Will: A dragonborn.
Liam: What's your thing? What do you do?
Will: What I do is not really important. What I want to get done, I think, is what matters. What I want to do is start this quest. Is that what you called it? Quest?
Matt: "It is a contract."
Will: A contract, a job. Can we just get out there, please, and do what we have to do?
Matt: "Very well."
Liam: I agree. Let's hurry it up, Merkin. Shall we?
Will: That wasn't your name, was it?
Matt: "It's Mertin. Mertin is the name. But it's okay."
Liam: I'm not from these parts. It's my accent. Sorry.
Matt: "I can hear accent from upbringing. It's Syngornian use. It's fine. Mertin. Never mind." By the way, the human that has walked out, you can see has shoulder-length brown hair, a leather cord that is tied around the center of the forehead. Eyes two different colors. One I believe is a light blue?
Will: It's a light blue. One is a bright yellow. And his right arm, all the way up from where you can see where it disappears below the armor is covered in one-inch cuts, with scars all the way up.
Orion: Ah, a religious man.
Will: Maybe.
Matt: Mertin goes over and knocks on a door, opens it up. This individual is easy to hear from a distance. The heavy footfalls and the grumbling echoes through the hallways before he even appears. Mertin leads you into the light of the main foyer area. "This will be the group of which you will be guiding on this. I appreciate you doing this for us. I know it's not really usually what you do. But here is your team for this contract."
Wil: I'm sorry, where is the team?
Matt: "This is your team." And Vanessa chuckles to herself. "I'm sorry. This is what you'll be dealing with today."
Marisha: Hi.
Orion: Hello, I'm Tiberius Stormwind.
Matt: "Now Thorbir, play nice."
Marisha: What was that?
Matt: "Thorbir. Thorbir, play nice."
Wil: So he's a dwarf. He's a really stout dwarf. He's got really a long, red beard that's singed off in the lower right corner. The bottom of the top part of his beard is braided and clamped off with all these ornate things. He's got these big, thick, ropey, white braids that come down on either side of his face and frame his face. And these have these really big Dwarven runes on them. Do any of you speak Dwarven?
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: No.
Will: Yes.
Wil: All right, so for those of you who speak Dwarven, this is a really offensive curse word in Dwarven. And this one is an even more offensive curse word in Dwarven. You don't say these in friendly company. He's got a scar that runs down across his face. And the eye that it runs through is black. And his other eye is blue. And you can see that he's got Dwarven script written in tattoos all the way down his right arm.
Matt: "So please, if you would not mind making sure that they see their contract to fruition, taking them on this as you will, showing them the ropes of the guild, and try not get them killed."
Wil: And for me?
Matt: "Well, you will be rewarded as per the contract. You will have done the guild a great favor, which you know favors can go a very long way in the guild."
Wil: I certainly do. You don't have to tell me about repaying favors.
Matt: "Fair enough. Well, perhaps now would be a good time for this jovial lot of adventurers to know what it is they are to hunt down."
Wil: Is it an actual group?
Matt: "Well, we'll see how well you can make it into one. Perhaps this is a test for you as well, fair dwarf."
Marisha: I think is going to be an excellent bonding experience.
Will: Seriously, the whole time she is like this?
Orion: Yes, she is. It grows on you, though.
Will: I'm sure it does. So does the plague.
Marisha: Everyone has such a problem with optimism.
Matt: She unravels it. Looks at it. "I think this will do well for what is required. We will bind this contract to you now. Feel free to take over. If you wouldn't mind reading, half-elf."
Marisha: You know, public speaking is not really my strong suit. Okay. Ordered and paid in advance by anonymous.
Orion: Oh, they're a fun group.
Marisha: This contract, binding in honor and the elements, sets upon the agreed members of the Slayer's Take Guildhall, and the task of locating and slaying the below-mentioned entity, and the recovery of the below-listed harvested anatomy items. And any anatomy items not recovered or not in functional condition will be deducted from the final payment and refunded to the client. Oh. This contract is good for three days and should the contract not be fulfilled within that time period, all payments are null and void, this contract is null and void, and membership of the Slayer's Take is revoked-- outside of the Huntmaster's willful forgiveness.
Liam: Skip to the punchline.
Marisha: The quarry has been approved for hunting by the Holy Paramours of the Crown of Erathis. The quarry of one rakshasa. What's a rakshasa?
Liam: Tiger man.
Marisha: Tiger man?
Liam: Essentially.
Will: How do you know that?
Liam: Storybooks in Syngorn.
Marisha: We need two rakshasa eyes, one rakshasa tongue, one rakshasa heart, two rakshasa claws, and two rakshasa canine teeth. So canine.
Orion: Would this be an arcana or this be a history check?
Matt: This would be more of an arcana check.
Orion: I'm going to do an arcana check. 18.
Matt: 18? Rakshasas were entities that originally stemmed from the realm of the Nine Hells. They are devils. They are deceptive, and usually embed themselves in elements of society where they can grasp and take power. They love having servitude beneath them, and they are notoriously difficult and slippery to find, let alone nail down and destroy. Appearance-wise, they look like a normal humanoid man, but have the face of a tiger, and the other curious element is both of their hands are reversed. That's as much as you can glean from your formal training and understanding.
Liam: Does this cat have a name?
Matt: "Why does it matter? All we know is we can confirm that there is one within the vicinity, or huntable at the very least. The rest is up to you to find."
Marisha: The quarry is where it's been last located? Oh, okay. Yeah, you double-check it. I might have missed something.
Will: Why can't we know who the client is?
Matt: "The client has decided they wish to remain anonymous for this contract."
Orion: This seems to be bothering you, Kashaw.
Will: Everything's been bothering me lately. She's not helping. Do you want to read this?
Orion: It's going to say the same thing. Which part?
Will: Give me this. How far to the quarry?
Matt: "Your quarry is the creature."
Will: You said it was in the vicinity. What are we talking "in the vicinity?" Are we talking a day's hike? We talking an hour from here?
Matt: "Meaning, we've been able to confirm that there is one that is within a huntable distance within the three days of the contract. However, part of this trial is to see just how good you are at finding and destroying such creatures, so that information is for you to find, unless you do not feel your skills are up to par for the Slayer's Take, in which case, you are more than welcome to go for the door, human."
Liam: And you have no further information? Are there any grumpkins you want us to find? Do you expect us to go out with no information at all to find a man with a tiger's head?
Matt: "Well, you seem like a well-traveled unit. You seem to have done well enough to find and destroy great things you spoke of as you walked into these halls. Prove to me that you are more than just sell-swords. Show to me that you have the intellect, that you have the skill sets, that you have the cleverness to find the creature that does not wish to be found."
Liam: Is this how things normally go around here?
Wil: Normally, I don't waste my time with the likes of you. Man with a tiger's head is going to stand out. No problem finding him. Let's stand here and talk about this forever, or let's head out and get this over with.
Orion: Well, dwarf, why don't you do your title and lead then? And I should warn you, you are walking with a Stormwind. You may not know my name, but I can assure you, I alone am an army, so we are well protected. So, lead us to find this tiger-man, please.
Wil: Dragonborn is a lot of talk.
Will: If he's an army, why not just send him out?
Marisha: That was probably the ballsiest thing you've ever said.
Wil: All right, Storm?
Orion: Wind. People call me Tibsy.
Wil: Let's see how good you are at following. And he heads out.
Liam: He's not very good. Oh, he's gone.
Matt: As the dwarf exits, and you guys follow. Outside of the Slayer's Take into the center of the main Quad Roads thoroughfare, on the outskirts of the bazaar to seek a rakshasa, wherever one may be found.
Marisha: I thought this was going to be a fun field trip.
Orion: Well, I mean "rakshasa" does sound fun. Rakshasa!
Marisha: It does. It is a tiger person, so maybe we can relate.
Will: I want to switch teams.
Orion: No, it gets better.
Liam: What's your name again? I'm sorry.
Will: I am Kashaw Vesh. Call me Brother Kash. Everyone else does.
Liam: Kash. Brother Kash, are you new to the Guild, as well?
Will: I'm not a member of the Guild yet. I had something happen with someone who did something and now I'm here. Why don't we leave it at that, for now?
Liam: That's how we got here.
Will: Apparently, I only have to be here for another three days, which will be good.
Liam: All right.
Wil: I'm impatient. Perception 20. Is there anything around that indicates where, which of these four directions is the best direction to go?
Matt: Knowing the city for the while that you've been here, you know there are places of open business that have a lot of traffic are also good places to ask for if anyone has seen anything that might match a certain description, or an individual that you are seeking, any strange behavior. And so you know that the center of the Quad Roads where that bazaar is, is a good place to start requesting information as you have currently none at your disposal.
Marisha: Just to get this clear, a rakshasa's not a beast?
Matt: It's like a man.
Will: It's a demon.
Orion: It's a demon.
Matt: It's a demon creature that looks like a man.
Marisha: But it's not a beast, by definition?
Matt: No.
Liam: I'm sorry. I'd like to make an insight check on the dwarf, not to see if he is lying, but he could be. Can I get a gut instinct into what his deal is?
Matt: Go ahead and make an insight check.
Liam: Three, but I'm going to use my Luck to try that again. 18 plus two is 20.
Matt: Would you like to go ahead and roll a 20?
Wil: Yeah, that's a two. All right. (laughter)
Liam: Just reinforce the myth, man.
Wil: That's one better than I usually roll. I'd say it's twice as good as I usually do.
Matt: Gruff exterior. There is definitely a toughened past to him. He seems driven. Not necessarily untrustworthy, per se, but definitely a man of little patience and currently does not seem to be too pleased with the fact that he's essentially babysitting, in his mind.
Liam: Is there a marshmallow center?
Matt: You may find out in due time. Yet that is too hard to read at this moment.
Will: If you're in the bazaar, do I have to be out of the city to cast Locate Creature?
Matt: You can cast that anywhere you want to. Your magic is divine. This is your city.
Liam: And that's not just a descriptor, either.
Will: Thank you. It's normally fabulous, but not in this city. So then how do I go about casting Locate Creature?
Matt: You can just tell me.
Will: I'd like to go ahead and cast Locate Creature.
Matt: All right, so as you guys are having this discussion, you're having this weird stare-off and considering where to go in the bazaar. You stop in the nearby alley two buildings down from where the Slayer's Take Guildhall is. And you begin just taking a small dagger from your side and carving a circle in the ground. Throw some runes down that are specific to your patron. Take a moment and concentrate on the description of this rakshasa. Looking at the specifics of the spell to make sure that I don't give you misinformation... Locate Creature. Beautiful.
Will: You guys have jazz hands.
Orion: Rakshasa.
Will: Rakshasa.
Matt: You focus your mind for a second, and your holy symbol begins to drift up from underneath your armor. You instinctively take and slap it down underneath, and then refocus your vision, your eyes closed. And you can see what looks like a pulsing energy, like a very dark flame. Something that itself, you can already smell the sulfur. You can smell the lineage, the devil lineage that this entity is. And there is indeed one not too terribly far from where you currently are. It's faint, which means that it is on the outskirts. And you know this lasts for a good thousand feet or so. But it does give you a northeastern direction. And the spell fades.
Marisha: Northeastern direction.
Will: We should go northeast. It is also unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, closer than we thought.
Liam: In the walls of the city?
Will: Not in the walls, but very close to them.
Marisha: Do we have any type of plan of attack? Does anyone know how to fight these things? Any earthly clue?
Will: Leader boy?
Marisha: Leader boy?
Wil: I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
Orion: Thorbir is what they meant to say.
Will: Listen to Stormfather over here.
Marisha: I take my social cues from other people. I'm sorry.
Wil: In my experience, there has not been a problem invented that can't be solved with an axe.
Orion: That's true. We've seen that.
Will: Wonderfully helpful. Thank you.
Wil: You're welcome.
Liam: Follow the axe.
Wil: Now what I want you to do is imagine an hourglass. You got that? Good picture of an hourglass in your heads? See all that sand draining out? Let's get a move on.
Orion: Okay. What am I doing with this sand?
Marisha: I agree with that. Are we supposed to do something with the sand?
Wil: Yeah, count it.
Marisha: Oh, that would take so long. Can we tag-team this?
Wil: She always like this?
Orion: Yes.
Will: Stormcloud's counting sand. I don't know what she's doing over here. Northeast. How about let's start walking that way and see what happens? Can we give that a shot?
Orion: I agree. You did the fancy spell.
Will: It's not as fancy as you might think.
Wil: I've pulled my axe out and I'm sort of holding it like a walking stick. And just very deliberately, very demonstratively walking ahead in that direction.
Matt: With each footfall, you know that what was once, probably hundreds of years ago, a nice cobblestone roadway in the center of the city has been slowly hit with mud, dirt, snow, sleet, and so each step is a slight moisture with each footfall.
Orion: I'm assuming there's no stables around.
Matt: Not immediately, those are usually to the very outside of the city.
Liam: Why are you jonesing for a horse?
Orion: So I don't get all dirty.
Matt: Thorbir, leading forward in the northeastern direction that was given by Brother Kash, eventually brings you around the side of the bazaar. And you can now see why it's called the Quad Roads, there are two main roads that meet right where the bazaar occurs and then they spread off into the other sections of the city. To the northeastern section, from your guys' perspective, the district begins to drift into another district that you have not previously visited. This district is, you've heard it mentioned before, known as the Duskmeadow. Now, previous sections you've been in have been worshipers of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. There was the Braving Grounds, which worships Kord, the god of strength and warfare and honor. The Quad Roads, which is under Erathis, the deity of civilization and invention. The Duskmeadow falls under the watchful eye of the Raven Queen, the goddess of death. That large obsidian-type structure that you were led to earlier is the temple that resides in the center of this district. And you've heard mention before of a few of the things that exist here. That being probably Raven's Crest, which is the main temple to the Raven Queen. This is also where the Amaranthine Oubliette is located, which is essentially the prison of the entire city of Vasselheim.
Marisha: The what?
Matt: The Amaranthine Oubliette.
Orion: Hammertime oubliette.
Marisha: Oh, there it is.
Matt: This is also where most of the dead of the city are interred into a series of catacombs that are built deep beneath this section of the city. Far enough away from the oubliette to the point where isn't crossover and is enough of an escape, because that apparently has happened in the past history of the city. As you begin pushing towards the edge of where the two districts meet, you can see that there is an area of the town that, for lack of better term, it's a more jovial than expected area. There are a series of stands put up along the side of the road. There's a lot of beggars sitting on the side of the street that are currently panhandling to those who walk by. There are a number of taverns. You can hear music coming from various establishments. And it seems almost the closer you get to the death-oriented district on the border of the Quad Roads, the more and more it pushes into a shadier Mardi Gras-type experience. So you make your way towards that dividing line there. What you would like to do?
Orion: What say you, Thorbir?
Wil: Let's ask around and see if anything has been a little out the ordinary, or maybe, in the ordinary.
Orion: Yes, I like that phrasing.
Will: Have to imagine anywhere this thing goes, there's going to be strange deaths associated with it. We might as well look there.
Orion: That's actually a good idea, as well.
Liam: And where we're walking, are there shops and stands, as well, or is it residential?
Matt: There are many that sell jewelry, many that sell very well-made clothing, some of them party attire, there are some that sell exotic fruits that have been imported in various states of ripeness.
Marisha: Is anyone selling any masks?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: Passive or active?
Matt: That would be an active perception check as you're seeking it.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21. You do glance around and there is one cart that carries costume, party attire supplies. It doesn't seem to have too many customers right now, but they do have a couple of masks that are on display.
Marisha: Are there any masks that look like tiger masks?
Matt: Looking at it, there are none that are tiger-specific, no. They seem to be molded leather and some more impish, goblin-y in appearance.
Marisha: Is there someone working the stand?
Matt: There is, yes. You see a woman in her forties or so, thin, with a big toothy smile. Her hair is pulled back into tight bun. You can see there's little bit of her blondish hair turning to gray on the sides around her ears, Reed Richard-style.
Orion: Did you say this was the Bahamut part of town, too?
Matt: The Bahamut section is far away. That's another section of the city. You are now on the line between the Duskmeadow and the Quad Roads, so it's Erathis and the Raven Queen.
Liam: I'm pulling a mask off the wall. This is a beautiful piece. Do you make them yourself?
Matt: "I do. I do, I make them myself by hand, hence the price."
Liam: They are quite beautiful. We're travelers here. I've never seen a neighborhood like this. Is there a festival going on here, or is this pretty much the basic fare of the day here?
Matt: "This is the localized festival of the city. If you've been around Vasselheim long enough you've seen there is little interest in celebration depending on some places. But, at least on this line, some people can appreciate the fleetness that is life and grasp it by the roots and make it its own before it's snuffed out."
Liam: Here particularly, there seems to be electricity in the air almost. It's very bustling. This is the norm around here?
Matt: "Consistently. That's why I come and bring my business here. I wouldn't do very well up north, I'll tell you that. All them dragon types--" Looks to you. "No offense. All them silver dragon lovers have an issue with things as celebratory."
Liam: And I pull out ten gold, and I spread them on her desk.
Matt: "How many masks?"
Liam: Oh, none.
Marisha: Oh, I would like one.
Matt: "Take your pick."
Liam: I slide one coin away from the other nine, and then dragging my finger across those say, is there anything out of the ordinary these days?
Matt: Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15? She gives you a look like she's trying to read you, looks about left and right. Glances at you and looks a little ugh. Glances at you and looks really taken aback, and then comes back to you with a escape of comfort.
Liam: Watching her, I pull out another five and spread them in front of the first nine.
Matt: "Well, I mean, some businesses here are a bit shady, I won't lie. And there are some long-standing businesses that have quarrels. Usually, they end in small scuffles, or one purchases the other and ousts them from the city. This is one of the few areas in which the more adult pleasures can be found, so there's a lot of money to be had. But recently, there's been, at least from what I've heard, a series of bodies have turned up. There were a few found, fished out by the Bastions in the water trough on the outskirts of the Duskmeadow."
Liam: The Bastions  what are they?
Matt: "Bastions who are the guardians of the city. From what I hear, they had been mauled by some sort of strange beast."
Liam: Mauled?
Matt: "Now, beasts on the outside of the city, that I can see. But on the inside, that is the stuff of nightmares. Is it not?"
Orion: Yes, I would agree.
Marisha: Have you had invaders like this before?
Matt: "I mean, death is not an uncommon occurrence for certain areas of the city." And she gestures off to the distant temple. "Some people invite it, even. But such violent death like this is usually kept to the outside of the city, at least with some sort of cause. This seems to be a murderous rampage that, me personally, I don't want to go out at night without protection."
Marisha: Is there is any indication of the cause of death on these corpses? How do they find them?
Matt: "I don't know. I've not investigated. Perhaps you have to ask the Bastions yourself that. Or anyone who was in the vicinity."
Liam: And can you point us in the right direction?
Matt: She looks around, and points off. And you can see, there isn't a whole lot of Bastion presence in this portion of the city, especially since the Bastions are more of a voluntary guard. People from the different clergies, the different temples, train to become Bastions, and fit themselves with whatever their deity's armor is. You do see there are two Bastions armored in a very dark, dark brown leather that carry a symbol of what looks like a silver raven that is embroidered on one shoulder of a cloak that is tossed to one side.
Liam: These guys are right here, essentially?
Matt: Yeah. Oh. They're across the road about maybe a block up. "I believe they're Bastions from the Duskmeadow. Perhaps you could ask them."
Marisha: Does she have any masks that look like a raven? A raven mask?
Matt: She does actually have one that looks like a raven.
Marisha: I want that one.
Matt: "Very well. A good choice. It doesn't quite match the color of your attire, but perhaps I have an outfit that could match for you?"
Marisha: Oh!
Will: Oh my god, we're going clothes shopping.
Marisha: Do you have a little cloak as well? A little cape?
Matt: "Cloaks I don't, but there but there is a cloakery about four blocks that way on your left. They can probably help you there."
Marisha: Thank you so much.
Matt: "Of course."
Liam: I notice a serpent-shaped mask on the wall. I just pick it up and put it on and say, thank you, madam. Much obliged. And walk off and clap Thorbir on the shoulder and keep walking.
Wil: Thorbir hangs back a little bit and waits for them to get to the door. And he looks at the shop keep and, do you have any masks that might fit a little girl?
Matt: "Yes, of course, friend dwarf." And she goes and rummages through a small bag and pulls out a mask. This little purple mask that seems to have small fake gems forming the outside, with a couple of ribbons that dangle where it would tie around the head. It's simple, but it's pretty. "Unfortunately, not many people bring children to this side of the district. They don't sell very well. But if you would like one, I would be happy to part with for two gold?"
Wil: One gold.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Wil: 18.
Matt: "One gold. Guess it is better to sell it than not at all. Here you are. I must say, I won't tell anyone, but purple is a pretty color on you."
Wil: Yes, it is. He walks out.
Matt: All right. A few moments pass as you wonder where your dwarven leader has vanished to, he steps out through the front of the establishment.
Wil: Let's go.
Orion: Great. Do you have potions? Are you all potioned up? Are you good on items, Thorbir?
Wil: I'm all right. Are you all right?
Orion: I'm just fine.
Liam: Well, we're in a rush, but if it's easy. How do you come by potions in this town?
Wil: Do I know the answer to that?
Matt: You do. They're either provided, from some of your experience, by the Slayer's Take, but those are usually offered at the start of a contract. The fact that they weren't offered on this means either they don't have any currently at their disposal, or they felt that this contract probably wouldn't require it with the construct of this group being set out. Other than that, they are a little hard to come by. A lot of them are controlled by the main temples and are pretty much given straight to the Bastions. There aren't a lot of individuals that are in need of them within the city, and those that travel out are either members of the Slayer's Take or members of the Bastion forces. So they are little hard to come by.
Wil: I think that if we're going to find them anywhere, it might be around here. Might be we can take some through trade. Maybe some might fall off a Bastion or two.
Orion: Well, let's go talk to one then, shall we?
Will: Thought that's what we were doing. Are going to the two Bastions over there or what?
Orion: Yes, Kashaw.
Will: Good. One other thing you need to know about them: they're horribly paid, so money talks with these people.
Orion: Very well.
Marisha: As he goes ahead, I keep up my pace until I trail behind him a little bit.
Will: Wonderful.
Liam: My hood goes up, and I'm gone.
Matt: All right. As you guys step across the way. It's about a block up. One of them is partially inside the alley between two of the buildings. You can see he has one hand up on the wall and the other down. One of them is relieving himself on the side of the building, while the other is keeping watch, arms crossed, looking out across the road. The one that's immediately present, or before you, you can see is human, a scruffy brown beard around the edge of the chin. The hair itself is cut very short. A little heavier in appearance. A little muscle, a little layer of winter padding, but the black leather armor definitely gives you the appearance of somebody who is a Bastion of the Raven Queen. As you approach, the hooded half-elf, the dwarf walking with the giant axe, and the bumbling dragonborn, the human cleric with a very angry disposition, and the awkward half-elf druid stepping in pace with him. Gives you all a cursory look and immediately puts a hand to his side where you can see that there is a rapier currently sheathed. "Aye, you walk with purpose."
Wil: We walk for the Guild.
Matt: "Slayer's Take it is?"
Wil: It is.
Matt: "What business have you on this side of town, then? Aren't you supposed to be out past the walls killing creatures and such?"
Wil: Our business takes us where our business takes us. Our business brings us here today.
Matt: "All right, then what's your business?"
Wil: You might be having some trouble?
Matt: "Aye."
Wil: What's causing you trouble and what's going to get us out of here might be the same thing.
Matt: The gentleman to the left of him finishes shaking off the rest of his alleyway journey.
Will: Any more than twice and you're just playing with it, pal.
Matt: He turns around and throws his tunic over. "Excuse me, it's official Bastion business. Anyway." And he nods over to the bearded gentleman who's standing there. "There are certain bits of business that are official in this town. I don't know how honestly right it is to be talking with common folk, or even the Guild who does what it likes."
Wil: I'm sorry, you're not talking to common folk.
Will: He wants money.
Wil: I know what he wants.
Will: Well, then give to him so we can get out of here.
Liam: I'm circling around.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Liam: 31.
Matt: I'm not even going to roll. I'm going to ask you to go ahead and you can choose if you want persuasion or intimidation on this. You're riding that line.
Wil: I'm equally bad at both of them. But I think that Thorbir wants to go intimidation. I'll give that a try. There it is!
Orion: 20?
Wil: What's the exact opposite of that? (laughter)
Matt: You know, I've heard about it for so long.
Wil: I know, right? You can't believe that it's a real thing until you're actually there.
Liam: Everybody talks about spontaneous combustion, but I'd never believed it.
Wil: It's silly. It's so silly to do this.
Marisha: Dice shame.
Liam: Naughty.
Matt: I don't know what ancient Aztec deity's temple you defaced when you were a child, but man. All right, so as you lean forward--
Wil: Please, just let me step into a bucket. (laughter)
Matt: We'll get to that. As you lean forward, forcing your presence on this Bastion, his hand's still holding the edge of his rapier. He steps forward into you, to the point where you're almost forehead to forehead. "Sorry, I have to lean down to reach your level. But if you're going to go about asking questions and not offering proper compensation for information, well, then. I think we have no business here."
Wil: If it's compensation you're looking for, let's just speak plain. And I pull out four gold.
Liam: And while he has their attention, I'm going to check out his pockets.
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Ew, that's not good. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. That's all right. Perception, you said? 28.
Matt: 28? Taking a moment as you sneak up behind the one he's talking to-- the two guys are shoulder to shoulder, squaring off with the rest of this group. The one that had been relieving himself in the alleyway is a little bit closer to you. You can see as he put his tunic right and everything, he jostled around and revealed a couple of small pouches on his side. One of which, you heard a clinking of glass on the inside. Go ahead and make a sleight-of-hand check.
Marisha: Go rogue, go.
Liam: Because I'm wearing a Cloak of Elvenkind, which I know affects stealth checks but not--
Matt: Not sleight of hand, no.
Liam: That's all right. 20.
Matt: 20. All right. You reach over and find the edge of the leather loop that attaches itself to the side of this Bastion's belt. You tug ever so gently to the side and the loop releases and you pull it off, seemingly without any noticing. As you pull out the four gold from inside, the Bastion looks out and scoffs and goes, "Clearly, pittance fee for this. What's to let me think that you aren't actually part of this murder scheme? You just walk up and try and start asking questions like this. First off, where did you hear about it? Second, you look like the kind that would go ahead and be mauling folks in the street, do you not, sir dwarf? You got the eyes of one who's probably done a few dark deeds."
Wil: Oh, I have. More than you can imagine.
Matt: "Then explain to me why we shouldn't take you in for questioning right now." And he pulls his rapier out.
Orion: Hold on. Everybody calm down. Hi, I'm Tiberius Stormwind. My friend Thorbir here didn't mean to offend, of course.
Matt: The blade up toward your face. And he says, "Look, dragon man, I was talking to the dwarf. You, I have no business with at the moment. So. You've got ten seconds before we take you in."
Wil: I reach into my pocket and rattle my coins around a little bit. Maybe I could buy us some time. And I drop ten gold out into my other hand.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Will: One! No, it isn't.
Matt: Three.
Wil: That's funny. I rolled a three on this die. So that's going to be a six. Guys, I think we're fighting the Bastions. I feel like maybe it's going that way.
Marisha: You rolled a one?
Matt: I rolled one.
Marisha: You all have really low self-confidence.
Matt: As you push forward the coins, in a semi-awkward forceful manner, the Bastion himself also seems to be caught off-guard, and looks down, and looks about. Realizing that now it looks like you are visibly out in the open, paying money to the Bastions. He looks back. "People don't stand out in public and do it!" And he pulls you all off into the alleyway to the side of the complex. Out of the middle of the area into the shade between the buildings. He reaches over and takes the coins from your hand and hurries them into a pocket. "All right, look. I'll tell you what we know. But if you're going to be messing around with this investigation, I ask that you don't let anyone know that you spoke with us. This is all on your own. And if you do say anything, we'll deny it and we'll make sure to put you in the Oubliette yourself for this. All right?"
Orion: Fair enough.
Wil: All right.
Will: All right.
Matt: "Now, we have found a series of bodies over the past few years, scattered about. A few months at a time between. All with a similar pattern of death to them. We found large portions, the meaty portions of the body had been torn away, some of them apparently eaten. There are marks that are indicative of some sort of beast ravaging the corpses, but no signs of a beast coming or going. And we've had many of our finest trackers looking for any sort of sign of a creature that may have found its way into the city. They've been in the rooftops, the gutters, perhaps even the sewers. No sign of any such creature traveling amongst any of these scenes. Now, all of the bodies have been found wrapped up and discarded in the canals. A lot of them surrounding the Abundant Terrace." Looks at the rest of you. "That's where Melora's eye is watchful. What's really got us confused of late is, the most recent murder that we found was a very powerful merchant lord from Ank'harel, one that's been in this city for no more than a month. He's well-known in these parts as bringing in a lot of business. His caravans come through via various skyships. And he brings with himself an influx of much-needed mercantile in the city."
Marisha: What's his name?
Matt: "I'm not allowed to say."
Will: You're not allowed to say?
Matt: "The merchant's name is Tyrell."
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Tyrell. Lord Tyrell. If you say any of this to any of our people, I swear I'll make your life the hardest it's been in months. And from the looks of you, you've had a very hard few months. Lord Tyrell's body was found, but apparently during the murder. We have one beggar that apparently caught sight of this the murderer. As best as we can tell, it was some sort of lycanthrope. The beggar was babbling, but it seemed there was some sort of wolf-like creature. It was seen bipedal walking a man, but tore this man right through the throat, most of his chest. But when spotted, didn't run, just vanished. Disappeared. No longer in his sight. No tracks left behind. Just gone. Didn't know if it was angry poltergeist, ghost. But the last place he was staying is at a recent establishment, only been here a couple of years. Referred to as the Velvet Cabaret. The Velvet Cabaret is a very high-end place."
Will: I know it well.
Matt: "You do?" He gives you a look of--
Will: I've heard about it from somewhere else.
Orion: Scanlan? Have you been talking to Scanlan?
Will: Don't know who that is, Stormshadow.
Orion: He likes whores. Okay. It's weird.
Matt: "The fact that that the lord had been staying at the Velvet Cabaret for some time, and we were feeling pretty close to possibly finding the source of these murders. Our bastion force from the Duskmeadow worked with the Quadroads and we actually raided it. Found nothing. Nothing but the patrons, no sign of any sort of foul play. We were forced to leave empty handed. That's all we've got."
Will: I have a question about the bodies. Have you seen them?
Matt: "I've only seen the most recent. The rest, I've just heard of."
Will: Anything similar with them? Are they all men? Are they all women? Are they children?
Matt: "No children. Most of them seem to be well off to do folk. Dressed well."
Will: Wealthy men and women? And you say you've searched everywhere, including the catacombs?
Matt: "Most. Catacombs themselves are sealed off. We've asked around, and there's been no sign of movement in or out. And gods forbid, anyone stays in those places. That's a nasty place to be staying."
Will: It is, indeed.
Orion: Is there a way that the bastions could organize some kind of gathering of sorts? Perhaps a mandatory town meeting, where all would have to gather for maybe an announcement or something official?
Matt: "All the bastions? That's near impossible. The city's scattered politically enough as it is. People can be rallying whenever there's some sort of force coming against the city. But when it comes to nothing for any particular reason, just the investigators take care of it themselves."
Wil: He serves the Raven Queen, right? He's got the Raven Queen patch on him?
Matt: Yeah.
Wil: This part of town, death isn't the worst thing in the world. Lots of planes other than ours, might be you're a little bit closer than some of the rest of us are; we're underneath the mountain. You wouldn't happen to know about anyone performing any rituals or maybe opening up lines of communication that may have been made and disturbed?
Matt: "I certainly hope not. These sort of communion rituals are sanctified and held within the actual temple to the Raven Queen itself. If anyone is doing any sort of business, there is a very watchful eye over the city. Anything that is unsanctioned, I can guarantee we'll know about it."
Orion: May we seek audience with this Raven Queen?
Marisha: I mean, she's a goddess.
Orion: Oh. She's not here?
Marisha: She's not a queen. She's a goddess.
Matt: You can see the two the two bastions are looking at each other with expression of "Really?"
Orion: We're new around here.
Matt: "Listen, we've talked long enough. We got to get back to our posts."
Marisha: Oh, wait. You mentioned investigators?
Matt: "There are different people assigned to investigate. We were part of the team that was sent as part of the investigation raid on the Velvet Cabaret."
Marisha: It's not a group of people. It's just, "you're an investigator today" kind of thing?
Matt: "That's part of what we do as Bastions, aye."
Marisha: Gotcha. Is there anyone else that is part of the investigation team that you think would be good to talk to?
Matt: "They wouldn't have any more information than we do, no."
Marisha: Can I do an insight check on him?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Marisha: 23.
Matt: He seems forthright enough. He seems impatient and a little flustered with the fact that you've been pushing these questions to him. But he doesn't seem to be covering anything necessarily.
Wil: Did he tell us where they found the-- I didn't write this down.
Liam: And Lord Tyrell factored in how?
Wil: Can you tell us where you found the body of the merchant lord?
Matt: "The body was found in the side alley to the Velvet Cabaret."
Will: You said wrapped up? Or just the ones in the river were wrapped up?
Matt: "The ones that were found in the river, they were wrapped up in blankets. Whatever put them aside was not some beast. There was some intelligence to this. And they were placed deliberately, which means, I don't think there's just one thing doing this."
Will: Were the blankets the same, or were they all different?
Matt: "They seemed to be different. Some were just scattered cloths. Some were tattered sheets. Some were bolts of fine material. Really varied. There was no pattern to it."
Will: Was anything missing from Lord Tyrell?
Matt: "Nothing more than his throat, his trachea."
Liam: We've pumped these guys for all they've got.
Wil: You're all right. Sorry about that.
Matt: "It's all right, just offer more coin up front next time. Be well. And if you hear anything, find any information, come straight to us. Don't be getting into official business. You're sanctified as a Slayer, but don't make us look bad." They step around you guys, back out into the main street.
Wil: Velvet Cabaret?
Marisha: Velvet Cabaret.
Will: It's close.
Marisha: So we know that this guy-- while we walk there, I was talking. We know that this guy is a demon from the Nine Hells. So, he seems to be targeting wealthy people. Do you think these are people that tried to get under his control, under his servitude, and it didn't go his way, so he ended up killing them?
Wil: Folk don't go into the Velvet Cabaret unless they got a lot of coin. Someone like Lord Tyrell. Do we know anything about him? Does his name ring any bells for us at all?
Matt: Roll a history check.
Wil: Oh boy. (laughs) It happened again!
Matt: This is unprecedented. You are the nega-Percy right now.
Wil: Just telling you. I'm just telling you.
Matt: This is impressive.
Wil: You think it isn't real. You think it's a thing I make jokes about.
Matt: You take a moment to conjecture where you may have heard the name. What was the name again?
Wil: Oh, the guy from Battlestar Galactica. Oh, what was his name? Adama?
Matt: You want to roll a history check?
Will: d20?
Matt: d20 and add your history modifier.
Will: Add my history. 20. Total of 20.
Matt: Total is 20? All right. You've heard of the city of Ank'Harel. It's a desert city from a long ways away. But you aren't specifically aware of this individual. You however, Kashaw, you know that Lord Tyrell has come through this city a few times in the past year or so. You've only been here a short time yourself, but in the time that you've been here, you've heard tales of this large caravan that comes through. And it is a parade. He usually brings with him a good 13 different carts that contain all sorts of jewels and materials and tapestries and fine silks, and it's almost a small party whenever this is this long walking caravan is brought into the city. So you are aware of this individual. You're surprised that the death has be kept so hush-hush.
Will: And are there rumors of about him bring in anything else? Anything illicit? Or is it kind of "what you see is what you get?"
Matt: As far as you know? No information that has caught your ear per se, but the fact that he's staying in this district, who knows?
Wil: Folks tend to stay-- Let me try that again. Folk tend to stay with their own class. These victims are all wealthy folk. And they seem to have the Velvet Cabaret in common. It's very likely that we're dealing with somebody who is rich and powerful.
Will: What does a demon need money for?
Wil: Who says he's after money?
Marisha: Seems to be after power.
Liam: Tyrell was passing through. I wonder how many people would notice him gone here in Vasselheim.
Orion: I'm sure quite a few.
Marisha: And it seems like it's no secret when he comes to town.
Will: It was a party every time he showed up.
Marisha: And according to the guards, these murders have been going on for the past few years, so it seems like whatever we're dealing with might have time to plan ahead. If he's been aware of the past few times that Tyrell has come through the town and could possibly know the next time he's coming through.
Orion: And if we could pinpoint when it actually started, we know years, but actually when, then we can actually narrow it down to the establishments and other things that were established then.
Wil: Would there be a place where we could inquire as to some sort of ledger like that when this guy comes in and with the intention of trying to correlate it with when different murders have happened? Actually, I take that back. Thorbir doesn't think that deeply. That's not the thing that he wants to do. That sounds like a lot of thinking and not a lot of hitting things.
Liam: This killer could be hiding in plain sight at the Cabaret. Could be an employee there.
Orion: Or the owner himself.
Marisha: How long ago did the bastions say that they raided the Velvet Cabaret?
Will: It was a month ago, wasn't it?
Matt: It was a few weeks back when the murder occurred, yeah.
Marisha: So here's my question  do you think he would stick around after it was raided? Or do you think he'd move on?
Liam: The thing is vanishing upon sight.
Will: And gotten away with it for the last two or three years. I don't think he cares much anymore.
Liam: My question is  we have three days, Cabaret's the only lead we have. How do we draw this person, he or she, out?
Marisha: I believe it is three days.
Liam: We have three days to collar it.
Matt: You have three days to complete the contract, meaning slaying the entity you're contracted to.
Will: I was going to say that you look like a man who knows wealth.
Orion: Yes.
Liam: I've spent time with wealth.
Will: Well, I never have, so I would think maybe if you were a merchant coming into town, very wealthy, looking for some adult entertainment, might be a way to bring him out the forefront.
Orion: Oh, I agree. I cast Alter Self on myself and turn myself into an elf. You're half-elf right?
Liam: Half-elves.
Orion: I'll turn into a half-elf, akin to a high-born half elf.
Matt: All right, fair enough. Even in comparison to Vax, your attire is very nice.
Marisha: Does this mean that I should go change clothes?
Will: You were going to go shopping.
Marisha: I was.
Orion: You look okay.
Marisha: Thank you.
Liam: Let's go. I jingle what gold I have in a pouch in front of Keyleth's face and say, let's go shopping. Come on.
Wil: Shopping montage.
Matt: As you guys go out shopping for better looking, well-to-do attire, we'll go ahead and take a quick five-minute break and we'll return here and as you guys continue to the next step of your hunt for the rakshasa.
Wil: Oh, Tyrell! I just remembered. (laughter)
Wil: What a silly thing to forget.
Liam: As the rakshasa bears down on your head.
Matt: Last thing engraved on your tombstone. Yeah, quick five-minute break. First off, before we get to that, guys: A big thank you to Negihama once again, our patron saint of ridiculous gifts, who purchased these sconces to put on the wall.
Liam: They're legit.
Marisha: Aren't the sconces awesome?
Matt: They are amazing.
Marisha: The LEDs change colors.
Matt: Reminder  every hundred subs we're giving away a signed picture and signed full-scale poster of Kit's art. And for the break, the five-minute break we're going to take real fast, we have an awesome video that was presented to us by some of the Critters that I think you'll also appreciate as well. So we'll go ahead roll that and use the potty and we'll see you guys in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. I assume we'll have a Liam here in just a moment.
Orion: He's just stealthing.
Will: He's stealthing. He rolled a 28 and disappeared.
Wil: I was talking Liam's ear off during the break about how much I love the dynamic among the three of you, and commiserating about how you feel really naked and exposed when your whole party isn't together. How weird that feels to not have everybody together at the same time. I think I kept him from the bathroom.
Matt: Oh, gotcha. That's okay. He'll arrive. When he comes, we'll all awkwardly stare. Yeah. When he does. When he arrives we'll all just-- But in the meantime, you managed to go back and--
Liam: Stealth. Disadvantage on my next five attacks. (laughter)
Will: I love the awkward stare. It was great.
Wil: He's actually a very generous DM if he does that. I actually make my players roll damage when they upset me.
Matt: Oh, that's good to know.
Wil: Yeah, dude, d6 damage if you annoy the GM.
Matt: Wrath of the gods comes down upon you. All right, so you guys taken a few minutes to acquire outfits that seem a little more fitting as to the establishment you're planning to go and enter.
Marisha: Guys, we should have aliases. Can we have aliases?
Wil: Yeah, I'll be Thorbir.
Will: I like it. It's easy to remember.
Marisha: Very easy. Oh, you know what, maybe I could-- would it be weird if I'm Vex? That's weird, isn't it?
Liam: That's really weird.
Marisha: Okay. What's a good elven name? What's something common in Elven? You were around this stuff. All of my people have weird tribal names. What's good?
Liam: Elivr is nice. Coralin.
Marisha: Oh, Coralin. Do I look like a Coralin?
Will: What does a Coralin look like?
Orion: She does that. Just agree.
Liam: I will be Scanlan Shorthalt.
Marisha: (stutters) What, you can be Scanlan, but I couldn't be Vex?
Liam: No, you can't do that. I'm just saying it's weird.
Marisha: That's double standard, Vax. I'm just saying.
Orion: I think it's maybe because you're not his sister and it would be weird because that's his sister's name.
Will: You have a sister?
Liam: I have a twin, yes.
Will: What does she look like? Oh.
Orion: But she's a female.
Will: She sounds lovely.
Wil: Humans, am I right?
Marisha: She's very nice.
Will: That's what they say about all the ugly girls. "She's very nice."
Marisha: I feel like I'm learning so much from you. Is that what they say?
Orion: Life lessons, yes.
Will: Velvet Cabaret?
Liam: To the Cabaret.
Wil: I presume that I'll play the role of your guard.
Liam: Bodyguard, yes.
Will: What does that make me? How about your valet? You'll need one if you're wealthy. Would you have a human, though?
Liam: Of course. Of course I'll have a human, being elven.
Orion: Are we on our way there now?
Liam: Yeah, we're walking and talking. And you're changed into a gnome.
Orion: Now I change. I change, because it only lasts a certain amount of time.
Liam: Boy or girl?
Orion: I'm a boy.
Will: So are you Lord Vax?
Liam: Lord Scanlan of the Shorthalts.
Will: Lord Scanlan, okay. Lord Scanlan of the-- I'm sorry, of the what?
Liam: Of the Shorthalts.
Will: Of the Shorthalts. Okay.
Liam: We have a cobbling empire. Shoes.
Will: The Shorthalts. Okay. Lord Scanlan of the Shorthalts.
Liam: We cater mostly to halflings and gnomes. Everyone, but specifically because they're so underserved.
Will: You have a gnome shoe empire?
Liam: Rolling in it, baby.
Wil: Where's your empire, human?
Will: I have no empire. I'm his valet.
Liam: We're wonderful partners, dear.
Marisha: Am I your wife?
Liam: Do you want to be? Is that weird?
Marisha: No.
Orion: I say it's equally-- no, it's fine.
Marisha: No, it's fine. Yeah, I can be your wife. I can RP this. I mean I can pretend to be. Yeah. So Coralin Shorthalt.
Wil: Thorbir is pulling on his beard and breathing deeply.
Orion: Now I cast Alter Self.
Matt: All right. Cast and a flash of light. You guys all pick up the very, very heavy smell of breakfast ale emanating from the deeply breathing, angry dwarf.
Orion: Wait, Vax. What was my role in this?
Liam: You're an advisor. A financial advisor.
Orion: Financial advisor. Excellent.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way to a little bit further north this of this route, five or six blocks until you get the outskirts of the Velvet Cabaret, which based on the description you've gotten from a few individuals you asked around, very easy to find. The fancy house of entertainment. It is a two-story building of dark cherry wood with strips of what looks to be black suede bolted in a pattern along the outside of it. It stands out like a sore thumb against the rest of the architecture, but it looks a night club. It looks very, very gaudy, but in a way that the garishness looks expensive, and so you can't really fault it for looking the way it does.
Wil: It looks like cruise ship goth club.
Matt: I like that. I'll take that.
Will: Cruise ship goth club.
Wil: That's a thing that exists.
Will: Really?!
Matt: When are we going to this?
Wil: Every year on the Jonathan Coulton Cruise, we gather in the cruise ship goth club.
Will: Wow.
Matt: JoCo Cruise.
Will: Too many jokes.
Matt: I know. As you approach the front, you can see that there are two bouncers established at the very front. To the left, you see a meaty male dragonborn, bronze scale with painted face scars. He has a very, very intense look about him. He's thicker. He's built like a barrel. He sits with his arms crossed, looking angrily out amongst the rest of the folks outside. To the other side, you recognize a burly-looking female with short hair and some facial tattoos. The Siren, who you saw battle in the Cauldron, apparently works as one of the bouncers of the Velvet Cabaret.
Orion: I approach right next to Vax, as we move up. Scanlan. In Draconic I go, greetings and salutations, friend.
Matt: He gives you a look of confusion for a second and leans forward and the dragonborn looks very intently at you and says back in Draconic, "Are you a member?"
Orion: Not yet. We are new to this place. My master here is seeking audience with his kind. We were guided to this place. This establishment has a high reputation. We wish to inquire how to get inside.
Matt: Looks over to the Siren. Siren glances back and, "What's he saying?" And the dragonborn glances over. And he says out loud in Common now, at this point, "He's saying that they're looking to come in here and talk to other elvish guys, I guess."
Orion: Oh, not elvish, but more people of high society. High society here.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Orion: 21.
Matt: 21. He gives a glance over. "Well, if you're not a member, you can acquire membership, but it has to approved first by the owner."
Orion: May we seek audience with him to ask or apply, or however that goes about.
Matt: "Let me get his assistant. Hold on just a second. Siren." She gives a look. "I'll be right back." She rolls up her sleeves and steps inside as the door opens.
Marisha: As I see her, I turn and face outward.
Will: You know her?
Marisha: No.
Will: Okay.
Matt: As the door opens, you can already hear what sounds like soft harp music coming from the interior. And it's hard to actually look inside because as you can see there are silks draped crossed over and in front of the entryway, as soon as you step in. A few moments pass, eventually the Siren returns and you are greeted at the doorway by a dwarf with very well-groomed facial hair. A beard that comes to a fine point, has a little gold ring at the very bottom that kinks it at the bottom, this little poof. With makeup on. Very rosy cheeks, and you can see there is eyeliner around his eyes. Smile to his face. Wearing these long white robes, lots of jewelry. And the rest of his dark brown hair is pulled into a dual ponytail that runs down to the middle of the back. Comes to door and immediately says, "Gracious welcome to all of you. I've been told that you're seeking possible membership to our establishment."
Orion: In Dwarvish I say, that's correct.
Matt: "Well, fantastic, then. Don't leave possible patrons outside." And looks off to the two bouncers and they grumble and step off to the side. "Come in. Come in. Follow me." And he steps inside. As you guys walk in behind him, immediately you're hit with the strong smell of exotic incense and the cooking of meat mingling with that. It has this smell of everything good you've ever smelled mixed into one location.
Will: Love the smell of these places.
Matt: The interior is fairly low-lit with what looks like a series of faerie-fire lamps dangling in small lattice cages. So it has this light purplish-pink glow to the general interior. There are no stools or chairs. There are tables that low set and the floor is nearly covered with very, very expensive looking pillows. All the patrons are currently sitting cross-legged or laying around the tables. And you can see the clientele is very well dressed and very wealthy. There is laughter and conversation. There's definitely has a very, very different air. It's like stepping into a whole different world from what you're used to seeing in Vasselheim. And you get the feeling that whoever created this establishment definitely created it to provide a very different experience for most people who work here, which means one, it probably makes a really good killing to the small number of clientele, number two, it probably isn't very well liked by the people who have been living here most their life. As you look around, too, there are dice games being played, there are many gold pieces being stacked up on tables. It appears that there's definitely a lively-- what's the word I'm looking for? My brain isn't working-- gambling arrangement in this place. You notice that all the guards in the inside, the bouncers, are common sell-swords. There's no unification to their adornments or any of their armor and stuff. There are a few folks that are looking around, keeping the peace, arms crossed. They all definitely have weapons visible. And they're just sitting there, guarding just like the bouncers were at front of the place.
Will: How many dwarves?
Matt: Just the one that let you inside.
Marisha: I reach over and I grab Vax's hand.
Liam: I fold her arm in and walk forward.
Matt: All right.
Will: I think, as they move forward, I would like to pull Thorbir aside and say, maybe since we're trying to get membership here, you should cover your runes.
Wil: Noted.
Will: Thank you.
Wil: I'd like to make a perception check to size up the guards around. Ten.
Matt: Well, that's a step in the right direction.
Wil: I rolled four times as good as I usually roll.
Matt: Looking about, they look armored. It's hard to tell their skill level, based on the low light in here. They seem definitely keeping an eye out, but you can tell they've been working here a while and they've grown comfortable. What you do notice, though, is a lot of the servers that are walking around are young men and women dressed in very fine silk robes or gowns. All have these iron bands around their neck, collars, that aren't chained to anything. But it immediately gives you this mental image of slavery or some sort of servitude. It does not appear that they are actually in some sort of servitude, but the adornment they wear is almost trying to get across that atmosphere, as if that's part of what you're paying for. It sickens you a little.
Wil: I'm going to carry myself and I'm going to do what I can to give off that I'm keeping an eye on this guy, that I'm the guy. That's how I'm trying to carry myself.
Matt: Okay. As you guys you have walked to the center of this room now, the dwarf individual who let you in turns around and with a bit of a bow. "I would to introduce myself. My name is Hosin. I am the manager of this fine establishment, the Velvet Cabaret. I'd like to welcome you..."
Liam: Scanlan of the Shorthalts.
Matt: "Scanlan of the Shorthalts? Where do you hail from? I've not heard of them."
Liam: We come from Emon. I sell shoes. We sell shoes.
Marisha: Yes, Coralin Shorthalt.
Matt: "Coralin Shorthalt."
Marisha: Yes, pleasure.
Matt: "Very well. Well, you have interest in membership you say?"
Liam: We do. We're hoping to sample the atmosphere here. Is there entertainment? We heard there was great entertainment.
Matt: "Oh yes, quite entertainment here at certain hours, if you like. For now, we have more an atmospheric presentation." And he looks over, and you can you see that there is small stage off to the corner. There sits a very beautiful elven woman, dressed in a gold gown that is sleeveless and hugs to her form very well. You can see that it shimmers and little bit of purple fairy light that is hanging above her. And she just this gorgeous-looking silver harp in front of her. She's just plucking away. Her eyes are closed, like she's just caught in the moment. And there's group of people that are sitting around her chatting softly, not to be overbearing to the music, but to just be around that atmosphere.
Orion: Your wonderful employees mentioned membership. We'd like to acquire that as well, I assume, as well.
Matt: You're saying this to Hosin?
Liam: This is Thorlaxalux, my financial advisor.
Orion: Thorlaxalux, at your service. I bow gracefully.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll. No, deception roll. Deception roll.
Orion: What is that? 16?
Matt: 16? All right. "The pleasure is mine. And it's not often that come across elves that have taken the time to learn the tongue of my folk."
Orion: I know many languages.
Marisha: He's very well traveled. Very well cultured. That's part why we hired him.
Orion: I was a bit of a shut-in as a child. All I had were books on languages to read and whatnot, and adventures and what have you.
Matt: "Well, if you are seeking membership, you should probably speak with our patron, the owner of this establishment. He's currently in a meeting, I believe, but step with me for a moment." And he leads you to go to the other side of the room. And you know, all these draped orange and gold silks that are constantly getting in your way as you push through. Leads you into a doorway that is covered in these silks. You push into the hallway to the right and left. There's a door across the way, and two doors down the left. And the door at the very end is a really ornate-looking door with a series of locks that currently unlocked. Hosin walks up to it and knocks gently onto it, takes a listen. "Ah, it appears that he will be available in just a moment, if you'd like to sit tight, and you're more than welcome to speak."
Marisha: Question, Hosin. While we wait, do you happen to have any wine or ale? Just while we wait. It's been such a long travel.
Matt: "But of course."
Marisha: Thank you. You're so kind.
Matt: He claps his hands, and you can see one of the servants that you saw walking with a small tray enters from the side of the hallway. "Yes?" Hosin turns. "The finest wine we have available for the elven lass right here." The servant immediately darts off, averting the eyes. A moment passes. Returns with three glasses of wine, looking over you two. Hands one to each of you. And the servant, still averting his gaze from the guests, smiles, gives a little curtsy, and then darts back into the main room.
Marisha: Cheers. Cling.
Liam: I cling and hand my glass to Thorbir.
Marisha: I take a sip of mine. It's very good.
Wil: All right. I'm sipping to keep up the charade, but I'm not happy about it.
Matt: It's definitely an elvish blend, which is generally too sweet for your tastes, but for what you were expecting, it's not too bad. Its serviceable. Nowhere near strong enough to really do anything, but it's not water.
Wil: So as I hand it back to you, I sort of mutter, wine. (laughter)
Wil: Giant dwarven air quotes.
Matt: The doorway at the end of the hallway opens up suddenly, and as it does, a servant walks out holding a tray that contains a bunch of partially-eaten fruits and what looks the outer gristle of some sort of cooked meat, and looks at you all awkwardly and steps past and disappears into the other room. You hear a voice come down the hallway. "Enter! I ask you all to enter. You are to meet me. Please, come, sit, be comfortable. Welcome to the Velvet Cabaret."
Liam: Look to Thorbir and then look in the room.
Wil: I step into the room.
Matt: As you enter, Hosin lowers his head and offers his arms at the rest of you to acquiesce. Stepping into the room, you see-- once again, a room that has a square or rectangular table in the center that has a series of small platters on it with bits of previously devoured meal, and there are three small cushions on the ground that you see would act as some sort of sitting arrangement. The opposite side of the room has three large purple cushions on which there are two women, also servants, that are just lying back comfortably, just resting, and in the center, you see a man, very dark complexion, ratty looking, crimped dark hair, very well-trimmed beard and mustache ensemble, and long black and gold robes. Very, very long sleeves and jewelry adorning every ounce of his hands, his fingers, you can barely see the actual skin beneath, there is just so much jewelry adorning him. He looks up smiling with his elbows near the edge of the table. "Have a seat. We are to talk, yes? Introduce yourselves. Guests are always welcome, but I wish to know who it is that I am guesting for."
Liam: I seat Coralin and have a seat myself. And pretending to check out the women in the room, I make a perception check. And that is a 16.
Matt: All right, what are trying to see?
Liam: Oh, if anything sets off my alarm bells.
Matt: They seem to be lounging. And there isn't like fear in their eyes or that they are being mistreated per se. Almost like they're here for atmosphere.
Liam: And the room itself?
Matt: The room itself-- Most of the walls have like a velvety texture to them. All the wood has been covered with some sort of material that has a comfortable almost-- Everything feels like it's a lounging bedroom. And that's the aesthetic of a lot of the interior of this location. You cannot quite see the source of the light in the room. It almost feels like there's an indirect lighting accoutrement across the ceiling. Whatever the source of lighting is, it's being spread across the top. It gives this sort of dark intimate feel to this current room at least. As he gestures out to the rest of you to sit. "I fear there are only three seats, but I assume that your accompaniment are accustomed to standing, anyway. So do not worry. Very good. Now you say you come for membership. Membership does not come cheap. Membership does not come to anyone. We have a certain level of clientele we wish to keep, because in keeping this it is easy enough for us to consider it very-- how do I say?-- exquisite."
Marisha: I'm sorry, before we go on, what was your name? I don't believe I caught it.
Matt: "I did not catch your name either."
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry, I am Coralin. Coralin Shorthalt.
Matt: "Coralin Shorthalt."
Marisha: Of the Emon Shorthalts.
Matt: Takes your hand and leans forward, and gives you this ginger kiss to edge of your fingers. Yeah, there is a slimy-ish presence, but not too aggressive. Just a very well-trained type of dealing with guests.
Marisha: I subversively wipe it on my robes.
Matt: "My name is Vince Cyinnor. And I am the owner of this house of joy and pleasure."
Liam: I'm the lucky man who married her. My name is Scanlan of the Shorthalts. We're in from Emon, and reputation of this establishment is well known within all parts of the walls. We're looking to possibly become members here. We hear the entertainment is top-notch, and we hear that business happens within these walls. But I'm not convinced. I'm hoping to stay for an hour to see what you have to offer. When I find I like a place, I stay for a long time and leave a lot of money. I'd just like a little taste.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: Using my last Luck of the day. That's better. 15.
Matt: 15. "Hosin, if you don't mind." And the door closes behind you guys. "Well, Scanlan Shorthalt. What, may I ask, business do you run that gives you the liquid assets to think that you can walk and rub shoulders among such astute clientele? You are well-dressed, I see, and well-versed in conversation. But have not heard of you before and I have very acute ears for people of such heritage in this city."
Liam: We hail from Emon. We're not very flashy. We certainly don't do much in public in Emon. I prefer to make my money and enjoy my money and I don't believe in ostentation.
Matt: "Why have you come to this establishment? I am made of ostentation, for I do not fear what people judge or think here. Do what you like."
Liam: Don't get me wrong. I enjoy the form of a beautiful woman as much as the next man.
Matt: "Why limit yourself?"
Liam: Who said I do?
Matt: "Even this one here, while his appearance may be rough, I'm certain that under certain circumstances he could be persuaded to prove his weight in more than gold and weaponry."
Marisha: Mr. Cyinnor, I think it is best that you do not make presumptions on our relationship and dealings.
Liam: My wife and I are businessmen. And what we hear is that this is where business happens.
Matt: "Business does happen here, yes. Quite a bit of interesting business."
Marisha: And we are very interested in all of those interesting businesses.
Matt: "From what I hear, as my assistant has told me, your business is shoes. Tell me, why would the business of shoes require such an ostentatious location for business?"
Liam: The shoes are the public face, but the well runs deep.
Matt: "We get to the meat of the matter, eh? So, shoes is but an appearance. What is your business aside from cobbling, Mr. Shorthalt?"
Liam: I know my way around poison, and I hear you have the rarest of breeds here. I have come to spend some money to satisfy my clients.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Liam: 15 again.
Matt: What was it?
Liam: 15 again.
Matt: "Poisons? So you supply to what? King-killers? Supply to sell-swords? You apply them to your own weapons? You realize this city is very, very tight-knit when it comes to these sorts of industries. Although I know you would think possibly to find it here, I guarantee you what we deal with here has nothing to do with slitting of throats."
Liam: I'm not looking to sell. I'm looking to buy.
Matt: "I will tell you one thing that I am interested in buying. I'm interested in buying information. I'm interested in buying loyalty. I'm interested in buying trust. Since you've walked into this room, there has been an air of something not right about you. And through this conversation, I have come to believe that perhaps you're not telling me the truth. Now, I will ask of you this moment, whoever you may be, Shorthalt or not, but this entire facility is very well paid to make sure that should you try anything funny, you won't get but two steps before the heads leave your shoulders. So let's be frank here. Who are you? Why are you here?"
Marisha: Mr. Vince, let's not play coy. I am sure you have dealt with many a powerful client in your day. And I am sure that it is not unfamiliar to you that many powerful clients have many deep secrets.
Orion: As she finishes that, I dispel Alter Self.
Matt: Okay. As your actual dragonborn appearance restores itself, he sits back.
Orion: My apologies. I am Tiberius Stormwind-- yes, wind.
Will: I can never get it right.
Orion: I merely dispelled this to show you that earning your trust is in our best interests. I do not wish to deceive.
Matt: "Then perhaps you should have walked in this form when you first arrived."
Orion: Many people don't take kindly to a red dragonborn by the way. I just thought it was best. We're in a new town and it was standard protocol whenever we visit a new town. My apologies.
Matt: "Well, one person has come clean. What about this one? What is your business here?"
Will: My business here is the same as theirs. We're here, in the long run, to help you.
Matt: "What is to help me? You have not told me what your business is."
Liam: We're here to stop a murderer.
Matt: "Explain."
Liam: Bodies have been showing up outside this building. Multiple bodies. We're not going to get into the details, but we've been sent here to stop that from happening any further.
Orion: We're fairly sure you know of this.
Liam: Look at this guy. Does he look like he's fucking around?
Wil: He winks at him.
Matt: The force of the wink itself is intense enough to the point where he physically shudders and leans back a few inches.
Liam: Now, you must be aware of this problem. Can't be a surprise to you. People are starting to take notice in this city. This was inevitable.
Will: Do you still have Lord Tyrell's possessions?
Matt: "This is about Lord Tyrell? We do have his possessions. They have been investigated. Our establishment has already been investigated. The Bastions were very thorough, and we have been found absolved of any sort of involvement."
Marisha: We are not Bastions. And we are not here to accuse. And we are not here to investigate your establishment.
Matt: "Interesting. You come in here and lie. It seems to me exactly what you're doing. Now, are you coming to ask questions? To see what involvement we have? Answers? We've already told everything to anyone else. We have no involvement. I don't know what you're talking about. This is ridiculous. And I may have to ask you to leave."
Marisha: He's shutting down. Someone do something quick.
Liam: Insight check, insight check. Balls.
Wil: I will also make an insight check.
Marisha: Can I do that, as well? (laughter)
Matt: What did you get?
Marisha: We're all going to die.
Liam: That makes my ten look titanic.
Wil: I'm trying to make you look good. It's what Thorbir does.
Marisha: 19.
Wil: I rolled a two.
Will: You're going up.
Matt: It's not impressive. That's mythic.
Wil: Statistically unlikely.
Will: That's the thing. You're beating math.
Wil: I've been beating math for 20 years. I'm very good.
Matt: Yeah. You're the singularity that ruins the universe.
Wil: Somewhere in the world there's a person who never rolls under 17. And I was placed on this planet to balance the math to save you all. To prevent the center of the planet from collapsing and taking us all with it. You're welcome.
Liam: She's in New Zealand. The other side of the Earth.
Matt: All right. So, as you're all taking this moment to yourself. It's hard to read. It seems like he's very thorough and offended by this circumstance. You glean that there is a nervousness, and there are droplets of sweat across his brow. And his brusqeness does show a bit of fear in his eyes.
Marisha: About this time, I go (fwoosh) and I cast my wind spell. And I slam the doors behind us. And I slam the shutters. And turn out all the lights. Did you say there was candlelight? Or did you say there was weird indirect lighting.
Matt: Yeah, indirect lighting. You don't quite know where the source is coming from. The door was already closed behind you. Hosin closed it. But as the wind comes out, all the silks blow against the wall. Pillows are lobbed to the sides. Both of the women in there (yelps) and pull back against walls, trying to keep out of the circumstance. And you can see Vince has begun to stand up and his hair blown back. "What is the meaning of this?"
Marisha: Now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I sometimes get a little out of control. But remain calm! All right?! Jesus! Remain calm!
Orion: You calm down.
Marisha: I'm sorry! I'm trying to remain calm, too!
Will: Doing a great job.
Marisha: Thank you! Okay.
Matt: Persuasion check.
Marisha: Damn it.
Liam: Who's in this room? It's the women--
Matt: It's the women and Vince. Hosin closed the door and left in the hallway.
Liam: Vince is the--
Matt: Owner.
Liam: But is he human?
Matt: He's human.
Orion: I'm going to approach him and I'm going to cast Mage Hand. I'm going to have it float right up in front of me. I'm like, now, you better start cooperating, because it seems to me that you're getting very nervous. And we don't want to do anything. Nor do we want to leave. All we want is information. I guess we want to know what you want to know, too. We want a lot of information. So start talking and stop acting like a fool.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Liam: He's sometimes hard to follow, but you don't want to fuck with him.
Orion: 15.
Matt: 15? As you do this, between you standing, he's in the process of standing up, and he was reaching for something under one of the cushions. As you do that, he glances about the room, looks over to you specifically, and back to the dragonborn, the dwarf.
Marisha: And I say, and whatever weapon you were about to brandish, you'd best wise to leave it be.
Matt: "You realize, you may have just alerted pretty much the entirety of my guard to this establishment. They'll be descending on this room soon."
Marisha: And you realize that this is only because of your doing?
Matt: He sits down on the cushion again.
Wil: And Thorbir looks at him and goes, okay. And pulls his greataxe out and leans on his greataxe.
Orion: I disperse the magic hand.
Marisha: I say, now. Our quarrel is not with you. We are not with the guard. We are not with the Bastions.
Orion: More calm.
Will: Yes, still doing a great job with the calm, there.
Marisha: I'm trying. I'm sorry. I get emotional. I'm trying to remain calm, here. Okay?
Matt: "What do you wish to know?"
Will: Once again, do you still have Lord Tyrell's possessions?
Matt: "His possessions are not under my keeping, no."
Orion: There we go. Thank you. Where are they?
Matt: "I have no idea."
Will: I want to do a perception check.
Matt: This would be insight, yeah.
Will: Insight check. Nice, where are we? Ooh, wow. 26.
Matt: 26.
Wil: What's that like?
Will: That's 29 of your rolls, strangely enough. (laughter)
Matt: Looking at you tense. He's fumbling lie after lie right now.
Will: It's just, you could easily tell.
Matt: Yeah. For you especially, all the signs are there, the quivering to his voice, his eyes darting from person to person. He's still covering.
Will: Okay, you're sitting in a room now with a whole bunch of people that want to hurt you. So it's obvious that you're lying. What do you know, or this guy and this guy are going to dragon and axe you.
Matt: "Look, what happened was unfortunate. There are things beyond your understanding or control involved here."
Wil: Oh, I don't know, we can understand a lot.
Orion: We fought a beholder before.
Marisha: Do not take us for fools who just walked in here without a clue.
Liam: I walk forward, I pull out Dagger of Venom and I drop a little bead of black down the blade and I hold it just about a centimeter under his neck. I've all run out of patience, friend. We're here to help this city and you're going to help us. Talk.
Matt: Make an intimidation check with advantage because of this whole setup here.
Marisha: Dear god, so many. Come on.
Liam: 20.
Matt: "They'll kill me if I say anything."
Will: We're going to kill you now.
Liam: Now or later, friend.
Orion: And we could protect you from them. Or it.
Matt: "This establishment. I am not the owner. I am a figurehead. Something else currently pulls the strings from behind."
Marisha: Something else?
Orion: As we said, it.
Matt: And he looks off, past you, just over your shoulder.
Liam: Perception check.
Marisha: Oh, son of a bitch.
Liam: 23.
Matt: You glance over your shoulder briefly and at this point you can see the door is partially ajar, and you can see in what little light there is a dwarven face staring through the passage that then slams the door shut quickly and you hear footsteps.
Marisha: Was that Hosin?
Will: Was that Hosin?
Matt: That was Hosin, yeah.
Marisha: Fucking Hosin.
Will: Thanks a lot, hoser!
Matt: He's shaking his head now, the blade there, as you hear the feet running off now.
Marisha: I'm going-- something tiny and fast. What's tiny and fast?
Liam: Mouse, rat.
Marisha: I'm going rat, and I'm going after Hosin.
Matt: All right. You guys watch as Keyleth all of a sudden grasps the side of her armor and then her form shrinks down to a tiny rat, then darts underneath.
Liam: I'm going to bap this guy in the head. I'm going to just flip the blade and strike him across the forehead.
Orion: As I see her do this, I open the scroll of Polymorph. I do Polymorph on myself, and I turn myself into a gadfly. And follow.
Matt: Okay. The scroll is consumed and gone. You turn into a fly and follow, as well. Two of your party members just shrunk and vanished and went off as creatures. You, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Liam: Okay, so on a surprise, it's advantage. So 19's pretty good. I'll take the 19 over the two. So that's 19 plus-- 30.
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on that.
Liam: Okay, sneak attack damage. Is this a surprise because he didn't know it was coming?
Matt: Yes, it is.
Liam: It is? So because of my assassinate feat, then this is a critical hit. So just the sneak attack damage? Okay, four, eight, ten, 12, 15, 21, 42.
Matt: With 42? Yeah, you (whack). He's out like a light. Lights off, face on a pillow. The two women squeal in reaction. You guys, as you rush under the door, what are you guys doing?
Wil: I've been leaning over to see what he was reaching for.
Matt: As you glance over you can see what appears to be a small jeweled blade that is hidden underneath one of the cushions there. It's a curved dagger that comes to a gradual point.
Wil: I'm going to take that.
Matt: Okay. So mark down jeweled dagger in your equipment.
Will: I want to search him. I want to see if he has anything on him, in his pockets, anything.
Matt: Okay. As you are beginning to go through his body, you guys have rushed beneath, and as you can see, the dwarf, Hosin, is walking down the hallway really quickly with his robes open.
Orion: As a gadfly, can I really quickly buzz in front of him?
Matt: You pull underneath, because you had to go underneath the door to make it into the hallway. You see him, he's about 15 feet away, and as he's walking, he's looking about very nervously. He's seen one of the guards is approaching, and he looks back over and sees the rat scurrying down the hallway.
Orion: How far away is he from me?
Matt: He's about 20 feet.
Orion: How far away is the guard in front of him?
Matt: You know what, let me go ahead and pull this up. It'll give a good indicator of the circumstance here.
Marisha: He does what?
Orion: Oh god, we have a map.
Liam: Gentlemen, we need to move.
Orion: Okay, so he's right there.
Liam: Mama Cass, what have you found?
Matt: All right, you guys are currently inspecting him at the moment, as you guys are rushing through.
Orion: Oh! So I'm within 20 feet of him, whatever?
Matt: Actually no, he'd be back here. He's just rushing past. So he's 20 to 25 feet from you.
Orion: Okay. Ah. I'm going to dispel Polymorph, and I'm going to cast Silence in front of him. I'm going to silence him.
Matt: Okay. All right, so you're using him as the source?
Orion: Yes.
Matt: Okay. So as you un-Polymorph, he looks over his shoulder and sees you take this form, you go ahead and cast Silence, which has an opposition. What level spell is that? 2nd-level?
Orion: Yes. I believe so.
Matt: Okay, cool. So that creates a sphere of a 20-foot radius of silence here. So he goes and he does like a hand motion. Nothing happens. Frustrated, he continues to run. I'm going to have you guys roll initiative.
Marisha: Fucking shit. 17.
Matt: 17?
Orion: Sorry. What is that? 17.
Matt: 17 and 17. All right. So you guys will both be going first, but before we finish that, as you guys are searching the body you hear all of a sudden the sound of some sort of scuffle, a flash of some sort of energy in the hallway that's muffled between the doorway, and footsteps also happening. As you're just starting to get through his pockets you start hearing some sort of a scuffle outside of the room.
Wil: I'm gone.
Will: Me, too.
Matt: So I'll have you guys roll initiative, as well.
Wil: Four.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Not great. Nine.
Will: 11.
Wil: There's 20 faces on this. So. I mean, look right? It can happen. I know that it's possible. I've done it in my life.
Matt: All right, so as you guys are turning, we'll get to your turn in a moment. Tiberius and Keyleth, you're up first.
Marisha: Are we at the same time? I guess I'll go ahead and cast out of my beast shape as well and cast Hold Person on him as he's running away.
Matt: Okay. Cool. Just staying where you are? Are you going to stay there or are you going to move?
Marisha: Well, he's right there, right?
Matt: Right there, yeah.
Marisha: So I'm just going to try and hold him.
Matt: Okay, so you go ahead and cast Hold Person. As the spell releases, you can see the mystical shimmering cage that seems to encapsulate, seems to shrug it off.
Marisha: Because he's not a person! He's not a person. I should've fucking done Grasping Vine. Goddamn it. All right.
Matt: Do you want to move or are you staying where you are?
Marisha: Yeah, I'll follow after his ass.
Matt: All right, you can get up to pretty much right adjacent to him if you want. All right. Tiberius?
Orion: I'm going to cast Telekinesis and grab him that way.
Matt: Okay. So from where you are you go ahead and you create your telekinetic force, you rush out, and the telekinetic force seems to have no effect on the dwarf's form.
Orion: It's the rakshasa! That's him!
Matt: Do you move?
Orion: No. I yell at you, don't chase him!
Marisha: And I go, what?
Matt: Which you don't hear, because she goes [no audio].
Marisha: Yeah, I'm in the silent bubble.
Matt: Yeah, there is currently no sound coming from the center of that area.
Orion: But she can hear me.
Matt: She can hear you.
Orion: And I'm not that far. You heard me, the other way! The other way! And I move in the room with these guys.
Matt: Okay. As you guys turn, you see Tiberius come rushing into the room.
Orion: The rakshasa! Nothing works on him! And I think that's not normal!
Liam: You're speaking Draconian!
Orion: Yes, sorry! Rakshasa. I believe the dwarf is the rakshasa. I cast many things, and Keyleth is in there, nothing hit him.
Liam: You left her with him? I shove past him and go straight through the door.
Wil: You ran away from the target? Ugh. I stomp past him in my dwarfy stomps.
Matt: Hosin gets just out of the sphere of silence and then angrily does a motion with a hand and then-- (shouting)
Marisha: I knew it was going to happen!
Matt: That'll bring us next to Brother Kash. Kashaw. What do you want to do?
Will: I want to go back eight moves and catch the thing. I think what we're going to have to do now is find out where he is. Let's Locate Creature again, if we can.
Matt: Okay, this is during your turn. Is there anything you want to do?
Will: Can we locate creature, see how close he is?
Matt: How long does it take to cast Locate Creature?
Will: I believe it is one action.
Matt: Okay, so you can do that, so you mark that off as another casting of that spell.
Will: Okay.
Matt: As you rush out into the hallway and see that it's vanishing, you cast the spell for a second, you can see the direction of the creature is roughly ahead of you and you also see a door on the opposite side, this right-hand door open and close.
Marisha: He goes invisible? He's not teleporting, he's just invisible. That's a big thing.
Will: Yeah, he's here. He's still here. We can't see him.
Matt: You still have 15 feet of movement, if you want to move forward.
Will: Yeah, I would like to move forward.
Matt: Okay. So you'll get up to that point with your turn. And you gather that that's the direction of him, and that you know that's where it's going.
Will: I know where it's going, okay. So we saw the door shut. That's where he is, let's go.
Liam: Don't run blindly in there, hold on.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm going to run just up past Keyleth, I'm going to look at her as I pass. Not bad. Keep going, stop there, and now I'm going to try to sense traps.
Matt: At this point, there? Okay, so you can get up to here if you're going to use an action as well to dash.
Liam: If I use, that's fine, yeah.
Matt: Okay, as you go to talk to her no words come out.
Orion: Can I see what's going on?
Matt: No, you're in the other room, still. Everyone darted out and you're making your way out. So go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: Okay. 21.
Matt: 21. Glancing about the room, there doesn't appear to be anything that catches you as a trap. This hallway is fairly often-traversed by the clientele of this establishment, and nothing seems dangerous. That would be difficult to put in the middle of a place and still run a business.
Liam: Okay. I look at Kash and Keyleth and say-- Are we out of initiative? We're still in initiative.
Matt: We're still in initiative. Currently, for the moment, just for the sake of the pacing on this.
Wil: I'm going as far as I can down the hall toward the direction of the bad guy.
Matt: Okay. That gets you to about there. Cool, that ends that turn, at which point three of the bouncers then start pushing through the silks. One of them pushes his way here, this one pushes aside, and they come out, weapons drawn, seeing all of you there, and one of them goes [no audio]. That's their turn, but it looks like they're ready to jump into some sort of combat circumstance. That brings us to the top of the round, Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Where'd you say the guards came from?
Matt: They came from the main room, where the silks are that separate the hallway from the main area. And you start hearing people shouting and some slight yelps and screams from the other room.People who seem freaked out by the sudden rise in energy.
Orion: What was that guy's name? Lohan?
Wil: Hosin?
Orion: Hosin?
Wil: The dwarf is Hosin. The other guy is Vince.
Orion: I just disperse Silence, and before I go out, I turn into Hosin. Alter Self.
Matt: Okay, so you use your action to cast Alter Self. You take Hosin's form, step out, closing the door behind you.
Orion: How did he sound, again?
Matt: How did he sound?
Orion: I don't remember.
Marisha: He's a dwarf.
Will: He was Scottish, but fancy Scottish.
Liam: He's glam rock. Glam rock.
Orion: Oh, right, right. What's all this noise out here? What are you bothering my friends for? Guards!
Matt: The guards look over confused and, "We heard there was a--"
Orion: Everything's fine. These are friends. Get on with your business. Get back on patrol. Make sure nothing happens or I'll have your heads.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Marisha: Oh, come on, Tiberius.
Orion: 28.
Matt: The guards look at each other. "All right, but if anything happens again, there's a problem, let us know. We'll be at the ready." They sheathe their weapons and look untrustingly to the rest of your group with your weapons currently drawn and step back--
Orion: Go on, get out.
Matt: They disappear back into the main room and they start calming down some of the other patrons who are starting to peek around them, trying to see what's going on, the action. Some look smiling and curious to see what's happening, and they're, "Go back to your tables. It's fine; there's no problem." And they disperse the energy.
Liam: Not bad, Tiberius.
Marisha: With that, I continue with the charade and loop my arm around Vax and say, shall we go into that room?
Liam: Just a moment, dear. Pull out the same poisoned blade and start walking down that hall a little further, and I want to see if I sense any traps further ahead.
Matt: Okay, to about there? Make a perception check.
Liam: Natural 20.
Wil: And balance was restored to the universe. Oh god, don't do that! Come on!
Matt: Put it away. Watch as the dice just like turns to dust.
Wil: It's the end of Raiders.
Matt: Exactly. You glance about the room as you're walking forward carefully, looking at the floorboards, looking at the tapestries on the walls, looking for anything that would be out of sorts, and your eyes very keen to find anything out of the ordinary. The room thankfully does not appear to have anything specifically trapped. It seems fairly safe.
Liam: Oh. Okay. And those are doors up there?
Matt: Yeah. Door to the right, door to the left.
Liam: Would that check include the doors themselves?
Matt: I would say with a natural 20, yes. The doors both also seem to be functional doors, not designed with any sort of trap attached.
Liam: All right. Pressing my ear to the door on my left.
Matt: Okay. Listen to it. Perception roll.
Liam: So many. Six.
Matt: Seems fairly quiet.
Orion: If we've stopped pursuing, does that take us out of initiative?
Matt: You guys are not, you guys are not currently in initiative because you're not in the thick of battle. You managed to disperse the conflict.
Liam: I want to do it at the other door as well.
Matt: All right, you step to the other door. You guys want to do anything else while you're waiting on him?
Wil: I'm just going to come, I want to get as close to him as I can and I'm ready for a fight.
Marisha: Yeah, I follow.
Orion: Thorbir. Do you have an extra sword or arm on you? Perhaps a shortsword?
Wil: I give him the jeweled dagger.
Liam: That one's a 19.
Matt: 19? Listening, you hear what sounds like a slight (creak) sound, some sort of a scooting of wood on wood, and then silence.
Liam: Kick in the door. Hard as I can.
Matt: Okay. Make a strength roll. This would be straight strength.
Liam: Wait, that's the wrong guy. 12. 14.
Orion: As he's doing that, I'm going to drink a potion of frost giant strength.
Matt: Okay. You slam your foot into the door. Oh, that was the foot that you just got healed. Oh, that's going to bruise. That's really going to bruise.
Liam: Keyleth-- Coralin, darling, could you come up here please?
Marisha: Yes? Did you stub your toe, darling?
Liam: Yeah. I think I want to get this door open quickly, please.
Wil: I'm going to hit the door with my axe.
Matt: Okay. Go for it and roll. What did you roll?
Liam: A one!
Marisha: No way! It's a lie. If it wasn't live, no one would believe it.
Wil: I rolled a one. Because it is what I do.
Matt: I'm going to test this theory. I'm going to trade you, for now, and I'm going to leave you with that dice and see if it has any impact whatsoever.
Liam: You have to throw it into the fire, Mr. Frodo!
Wil: The curse doesn't care about which die is rolled.
Matt: Which is very possible, but there needs to be--
Liam: This is like science class.
Marisha: Maybe it's because that dice was in the vicinity of Matt's hair, you'll be good.
Matt: All right.
Wil: So how much damage do I take for some reason?
Matt: So as you pull back the axe, you actually swing wildly backward, nearly hitting Vax in the process. You have to dodge out of the way as the axe embeds itself into the wood behind you.
Wil: Ugh. Again.
Matt: Axe is stuck.
Liam: I slap myself on the forehead and go ugh. Pull out thieves' pick and start on the lock.
Matt: Okay, you unclasp. As you do, you feel your throat seize suddenly as the cold liquid tends to freeze up what is normally a very warm and very fire-breeding interior to your throat. And it thaws slowly, and as you exhale you can see the mist, and suddenly your muscles pulse with energy and you feel like your physical form is embodied strength far more than you've ever felt in your body before.
Orion: With his jeweled dagger, I take out my dagger. I feel great.
Liam: The freshmaker.
Matt: There's now the angriest dwarf right now clutching two daggers as you get down with your thieves' tools.
Liam: Yeah, let's try to leave the room. That's better. That's a 24.
Matt: All right. The door swings open without issue. It's one of the easier jobs you've had.
Liam: I should've done that in the first place.
Marisha: Yeah! Should've beat it down and then.
Matt: You push open the door and find your way into what looks like a very well-adorned bedroom. There is a small table on the side where there are some books stacked up. There's a dresser on the far end that's closed. There is a canopy bed set up. There is a small end-table on the side. And the rest of the room has a nice circular rug that's thrown across the center, and there are no windows currently to this room.
Liam: I turn my head to everyone and just mouth the words-- and perception check the room.
Marisha: Can I perception check, as well?
Liam: 24.
Marisha: Can I just look to see, I want to just meditate and-- what did you just roll? 24?
Liam: 24.
Marisha: I want to see if I see any movements or brushes of cloth or anything like that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: 19. Not as good as Vax.
Matt: All right.
Wil: How long does it take me to pull the axe out of the wall, and how far into Yakety Sax does the soundtrack get while I'm up there and with the foot and then I'm jumping on it and trying to pull it down.
Matt: We're currently hitting the one minute 15 second mark. Haven't quite pulled it out of the wood yet.
Wil: Okay, good. And my little legs are kicking underneath me while I pull it down, cursing in Dwarven.
Liam: They call me Benny. Benny Hill.
Matt: Do you wish to enter the room?
Will: I don't, actually. Because of all the sound, I wish to turn my back to the room and guard the hallway while everybody else is inside checking out the room.
Matt: Okay, you're keeping an eye out, and you do see that there's one of the guards just to the side who's just keeping an eye looking over carefully. You guys make a perception check, looking around the room, you see there is no movement, there are no curtains on the walls. There is the rug, and most everything else in here seems to be perfectly still. You catch what looks like a little bit of movement of the canopy bed, the material that's on top. There's a slight sway to it that comes to stillness you just barely catch with your keen half-elven eye.
Liam: I would like to run up the bed and stab up. Both hands. Clicking the Boots of Haste.
Matt: Okay. (bam) Click the Boots of Haste, you run and charge up into the bed and stab upward into the canopy. The material is torn asunder, this very fine, probably imported silk is carved into three separate ribbons and falls gently onto the cushion of the bed proper, revealing the hardwood ceiling above you.
Liam: I'm going to check the ceiling. There's a lot of perception. I'm all out of Luck. That's no good. That's a 14.
Matt: 14, looking about, it's solid wood, you can move your fingers along and you're standing on the bed, you can just get it within reach, and feeling along the board, it's all pretty solid.
Marisha: I want to make myself soccer field goalie this stuff with the door, in the door frame, just really trying to see if I can see any brush of dust or movement.
Matt: Okay. Keeping an eye out. You pull your axe free. Into the hallway door in front of you. Not a lot of strength. You pull it out and try the best you can to save some grace.
Will: Well done. Yeah, that was graceful.
Liam: I motion Tiberius over.
Orion: Should I do a perception on that? Nope.
Matt: That ceiling looks pretty solid.
Will: Can I turn, saving my back to the door, I turn over. I do a perception check.
Matt: Go for it. You step over, you glance past Keyleth.
Will: Oh my god, one.
Wil: Stop trying to steal my thing, you guys.
Matt: You glance over and you're more distracted by the fact that Keyleth is doing this awkward field goal thing in the door to you for no reason, and you forget what you were in the middle of doing.
Marisha: I'm trying to make myself big.
Matt: There appears to be no exit from the ceiling.
Wil: Can I enter the room?
Matt: You may. You push past the confused cleric.
Wil: Okay, so I look around. I look at the rug. I sigh heavily. And I pull the rug.
Matt: You pull the rug, revealing a wooden floor. Plain slats.
Marisha: You thought that was going to be good!
Will: With a point, too!
Matt: You were never a fan of elves or half-elves before, but this one's really starting to dig into you a little.
Wil: I'll make a perception check because we could total up all my rolls and I'd have five.
Liam: Come on. Hey!
Wil: Look at that. That's actually better. 20.
Matt: 20. You pull the rug back. There's nothing there, and you look about at the rest of the folks with a heavy sigh. But the rug was on the right track. Everyone was keeping high. Looking beneath the bed, you can see what looks to be, in the shadow, some little bit of elevated wood that catches your attention.
Wil: I just, under the bed!
Orion: Oh! I'll motion over there.
Liam: We're not silenced, right? So I'm yanking off any fancy clothes I have on and I'm pulling my Cloak of Elvenkind out. I'm putting it over. And I spider under the bed and check it for traps.
Marisha: I pick up his clothes and I put them in the Bag of Holding.
Will: Oh my god, she's folding the clothes. We're in the middle of this, and she's folding the clothes.
Marisha: They might come in handy later.
Liam: 25 for looking for traps.
Matt: Okay. Well, it's a good thing you rolled high enough perception, because as you spider underneath, your first hand goes underneath and you nearly tumble and you catch yourself. There is a five-foot-wide hole in the ground right beneath this bed. And as you catch yourself, you can feel a little bit of wind slowly drifting up from underneath. There's some sort of airflow coming up from underneath this bed where this hole is, and you feel over and you can see that little bit of wood that you saw looking forward is the top of a makeshift ladder that is currently fastened to the side of this tunnel that disappears beneath the room.
Liam: Is there dim light down there?
Matt: It is pitch black. You can see with the dim light from your low-light vision a little ways into it, about 20 or so feet from the angle you're at, because you're not looking directly in. And even just glancing over the side it continues down for quite a while.
Will: And it's big enough to fit all of us if we wanted to go.
Matt: Independently, yes. One person would go down. It would be single file, of course, because it's a tight tunnel.
Will: Only one way to go, right?
Liam: You can see in pitch black, right?
Wil: I have darkvision, 60 feet.
Liam: Is that dim or dark?
Wil: Dark.
Matt: Darkvision, you can see within a short distance of pitch black and then a larger distance at low light, so yeah.
Wil: I'll go.
Matt: All right. So we'll put in order here, who's going down next? All right. And after Vax?
Marisha: I'll follow my husband.
Matt: Keyleth. That's weird. Tiberius?
Orion: Before we go down, I'm going to take off my outer-- no, I can't take off anything because that's all my gear. Never mind. I don't do that, but before we go down I cast Stoneskin on myself. I cast that right now.
Matt: Okay. As your form shimmers for a second and you see-- you notice this too, Kashaw-- his scales almost seem to protrude into earthy spikes and then form and solidify, almost like his body becomes its own suit of armor.
Will: Okay, that's cool.
Orion: Even though I'm still a dwarf, though.
Will: I'm going to go, but I'm going to cast Freedom of Movement on myself before I go down there.
Matt: Okay. As you do, even with the encumbrance of the armor you're wearing, you feel like your form is a little more agile and you're ready for anything that might try and stop your passage. You guys begin making your way down, with Thorbir leading the way. You descend for a good three to four minutes, you gather probably a hundred feet or more down, rung by rung, and there are a few that you reach that are a little rickety. About a hundred feet down, one hits your foot and snaps, but you manage to catch yourself on it, but you get the feeling this ladder is probably not meant to hold someone of your heavy physical form.
Wil: Largesse?
Matt: Largesse, you could use, yes. One by one, you make your way down until eventually you're, you begin to see towards the edge of your darkvision, floor finally begins to appear and rise towards you. You step off the ladder into what appears to be a small circular area that leads into another ten-foot-by-ten-foot tunnel, ten by 15 foot up, and continues forward. This is very natural carved earth, it's not smoothed stone, it just looks like a tunnel that was mined out of the floor.
Will: Is it still dark?
Matt: It is still dark, there is no light source currently. And you all eventually make your way down.
Will: Is there anything loose down there that I can grab a hold of?
Matt: You can't see anything. Mr. Human, you are in pitch-black darkness.
Will: Well, that's why I'm wondering if I feel around underneath me to try to find some kind-- do I find a loose stone? Do I find a pebble? Can I find anything to grab?
Matt: Reach down, yeah, you manage to find a couple of small stones.
Orion: As he's milling about, Light.
Will: That's what I was going to do, but he beat me to it. Thank you.
Matt: So you reach down and you find a stone, you pick it up, you begrudgingly grab your holy symbol, and as you begin to recite your cantrip incantation, a flash of white light comes gleaming off the top of the dragonborn sorcerer's staff.
Orion: Dagger. Because I have two daggers in my hands.
Matt: That's true. One of the daggers is now glowing. The jeweled one, twice as pretty when it's emanating torchlight.
Will: Nice. Thanks for the warning, by the way.
Orion: Sorry, I usually just do it when it's dark.
Wil: This tunnel goes in just one direction?
Matt: One direction.
Wil: I'm walking down the tunnel.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say for the sake of marching order, who all is going in after Thorbir? In what order?
Will: I'll go next.
Matt: All right. Following Thorbir.
Liam: I'll go behind Kash.
Will: I don't need this at all, but I just wanted to play with it. That's me right there.
Orion: I'll follow. I'll keep on Thorbir's six.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I'll stay 15 feet behind him.
Matt: 15 feet behind? All right. And Keyleth, you continue up that way. All right, so that'll be the marching order.
Wil: So I've got my axe out. And may I make a perception check to see what I see? To just see if I can pick up footprints or motion or whatever?
Matt: This would be more tracking, if you're looking for footprints, so that'd be wisdom.
Wil: Okay. Just a straight wisdom?
Matt: Survival.
Wil: Survival, hang on. Not my system. Eight.
Matt: Eight? Okay. It's hard to tell. It looks like this area is not heavily traversed, and what little sign of footprints there are scattered enough that it's hard to make out a specific print. But I mean, they have been traveled before.
Liam: I'm looking over Thorbir's head and looking for traps as he walks from behind. 22.
Matt: 22? All right. As you guys are walking forward and going through this, you get about 40 feet forward before you catch that there is a slight divot, a small drop in the dirt, and one looks like a section of intentionally placed plate of some kind.
Liam: Wait a tick. I'm going to go up to the edge of it and try to inspect it and see if I can find a trigger or see how it works. Six. And that is, what is that, perception?
Matt: Are you checking to see how it works?
Liam: I want to see if I can disarm.
Matt: To disarm it. Okay, that would be with your thieves' tools. So this would be a dexterity plus your thieves' tools, so plus seven.
Liam: That's a 19.
Matt: 19? Okay. As you go to the plate, you stop and look up at the walls to the side, and to each side of the wall you can see these tiny little holes, these little quarter-sized, gold-piece-sized tunnels bored multiple places on both sides of this wall. And you take the plate, you realize this is a pressure plate-based trap, and taking one dagger, you slightly lift it. The second one, you eventually find beneath where the trigger apparatus is, and you gingerly cut each part of these spring-loaded triggers until eventually the plate rises more and more and more and you remove the last bit, the plate tips over, and the trap itself is disarmed.
Will: Nice work.
Orion: I mean, well done, rogue.
Wil: So I keep going down. I want to hit a thing.
Matt: All righty.
Wil: That's not a wall.
Matt: There is that. All right. Pushing forward, continuing for another 30-40 feet, do you want to check traps again?
Liam: Again. 12.
Matt: 12? Okay. Pushing forward for a period of time, there doesn't appear to be any change. There are no more divots. You're keeping a very close eye for the traps. And as you're walking forward with your axe. As you're stepping forward you get this weird tickle across your nose, like a spider web of some kind that catches you, and you instinctively reach up and brush it away from your nose. As your finger presses against it, it's much sturdier than a spider web. It's a metallic wire, and as you push away (tink). You hear that slight noise. Tiberius, behind you, you hear a grinding of stone, and a loud slam sounds, like something extremely heavy just dropped behind you.
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You guys glance over your shoulder and you see what looks to be a fairly rounded boulder--
Orion: I dispel Alter Self immediately so I have longer-ass legs.
Matt: Well, Alter Self is gone if you're casting Stoneskin, because that's a concentration spell. Oh, that. But that only carries it for a few rounds. It's been a longer time than that.
Orion: It's been 15 minutes. Time has passed. Never mind. I don't do shit.
Matt: But yeah, don't worry about that. But the stone boulder just--
Marisha: Indiana Jones, motherfuckers!
Matt: Picking up speed with the slow decline of this room. All of you guys, what are you doing?
All: Run!
Matt: You're bolting forward.
Orion: I cast Fly on myself and fly.
Matt: You cast Fly, pushing forward, and you guys get a little speed, but you've noticed the boulder's started to gather steam as it continues down, and the pathway you guys are running is going at a heavier and heavier decline as you push forward.
Orion: Oh! As I'm flying, I turn around with my ring and I cast Slow on the boulder.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make a-- actually, no. This is interesting. Let me see if Slow would have a direct effect on this boulder. That's something that happens right now that I didn't consider. I love when that happens. Unfortunately, it is not a creature and actually it affects the physical metabolism and muscle use of an individual. This is just a solid structured object. As you release the spell, you see the air around it poof, and drift a little slower, and the boulder seems to stutter for a moment, but continues to push forward. That was your action.
Orion: Damn it.
Liam: I would like to cast all of my spells in succession for the next ten minutes.
Matt: I assume you're going full sprint? Okay, so pushing forward, you all push forward, Tiberius who has stopped to turn around and cast the spell is not at a full dash, so he trails behind. The boulder is currently gaining on Tiberius.
Orion: I Gandalf it.
Matt: So you turn around. You're continuing to fly forward. So you guys just turn to push forward. Tiberius, the boulder is nearly upon you now. What are you going to do?
Orion: Oh! Awesome. Is it at least ten to 15 feet away from me?
Matt: It is about ten to five feet away from you, you can see it cresting--
Orion: Sweet. As I'm now frustrated, I cast a 5th-level spell, and I will cast my Obelisk of Iron, three in a row behind me.
Matt: Okay. All right. You burned that spell. All of a sudden, the room behind you, out of the stone, pockets of iron ore or whatever material is beneath the earth behind you is brought together into a liquid mass and then shoots up in the center of the hallway behind you. With each one of these pillars slamming into the wall, you guys hear these three multiple explosions behind you, and for a brief second you fear the worst for Tiberius' current status. Immediately following that, you hear the impact of stone against iron, and you see the obelisks bend with this horrible creaking sound.
Marisha: Keep running!
Orion: That should stop it right there.
Marisha: I don't know.
Matt: The sound of the rolling has stopped.
Marisha: I still don't trust it. Let's just all get out of this hole.
Orion: I keep Gandalfing.
Marisha: It could give way at any moment.
Liam: Let's walk. Shall we walk? I think we should walk.
Wil: I like to walk.
Matt: Okay. You guys continue moving forward, the decline getting a little more difficult to traverse as your feel yourselves now having to feel your arms across the wall or use it for balance to make sure you don't just fall. Also, the moisture in the air begins to grow more and more thick. Some source of liquid some point down in the future has permeated what was originally dusty, dry air with liquid of some kind, and the air itself grows more and more rancid in scent. It smells like refuse or rot. It's hard to describe, and it's old. It's musky, it's terrible, and it grows stronger the farther you go. As you continue pushing forward, you also feel that the dusty ground is becoming more and more mud-like.
Wil: Is it making my hair poof out and look stupid?
Matt: A little bit, yeah. You spent all morning treating it and it's undoing everything you did.
Wil: This is why I lived in the mountains.
Will: Is there any light? Any light source? There's no natural light? We're not walking towards any type of light?
Matt: It's just a tunnel into darkness right now.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any type of plant life?
Matt: From what you can tell, there is no plant life at all whatsoever. The moisture gathered on the walls you can now see are dripping. The condensation has given this tunnel more of a mineral-pocketed look, and the ground is getting more sludgy with each step.
Wil: I want to make a-- I'm sorry, you're not done.
Marisha: I was just going to ask  are the walls stone or chiseled-out rock?
Matt: It feels like it's chiseled-out, hard earth that has been packed and supported with either small wooden things that are inset to make sure it doesn't collapse at some point, a lot of that has either fallen through.
Will: So it could collapse at any time.
Matt: Well, if you do any severe damage to its structure. It would probably be a bad idea.
Marisha: Right, like drop a boulder down it.
Matt: It's not a mine shaft.
Marisha: What were you going to say?
Wil: I would like to make a-- you tell me what check it is. What I want to do is to look down into this thick mud stuff. What I'm looking for are tracks, and if I do well enough, I want to see if I can get a sense of how fast the thing was going. Has it slowed down because it's comfortable, or is it still running?
Matt: Okay, make another survival check.
Wil: So I'm underground.
Matt: Actually, as a dwarf I'll give you advantage on that, so roll again. That makes sense, this is your place.
Liam: Well, the higher one was four. The lower one was a one.
Will: The higher one was a four?
Wil: Remember what I told you about the Wheaton dice curse? I'm sorry. Because no one will believe me. No one ever believes me.
Marisha: He's been taking pictures of all his fails so everyone believes it.
Will: At this point, I'd be amazed that he hasn't helped us in any way, shape, or form, and cast a perception check of my own.
Matt: Sure.
Will: There we go. So let's see, we are at 21.
Matt: 21, okay.
Will: You are useless. For the love of god.
Matt: As a pre-existing member of the Slayer's Take and the man who was currently set to be the leader of your group, you're beginning to wonder if this guild is the kind of thing you really want to be joining, at this point.
Wil: I haven't been in a fight yet.
Matt: True. But looking down you can see there are no tracks, actually. This line has not been traversed in quite some time, and the smoothness of it says that whatever came through here did not leave any footprints.
Will: At all?
Matt: No. Also, as you guys continue, you reach a point where, especially with your heavy armor-- go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Oh no.
Liam: You got this.
Will: Ten. So wait. 13.
Matt: 13? Okay. You're stepping forward, keeping an eye out, and you look back at the group and take a step and your foot slips out from under you. (smack) You hit the slime and begin to slide down the tunnel as part of the decline. You guys watch as your cleric Goonies-style slide vanishes into the darkness.
Will: It's our time. It's our time down here.
Wil: Hey, you guys!
Matt: Kashaw has vanished into the darkness and you hear, (screams).
Will: (screams)
Orion: As I see this happening, I run over and go like, this looks like a lot of fun!
Matt: As you lunge through the air, because you're flying, still.
Orion: Oh. Has ten minutes passed? I thought ten minutes? It only lasts for like ten minutes.
Matt: Oh, then yeah, it's faded. So you just slide after?
Orion: Yeah, I go, this looks like a lot of fun. And I go and I slide.
Matt: Tiberius slides after, body first across the slime.
Marisha: And then I see Tiberius go and I go, (whoops). And I go, too.
Matt: All right. Three of your party have just vanished into the darkness, hoping that fate will take them to some place of pillows and feathers.
Liam: I think I'd rather walk as long as I can.
Wil: I think I'm with you.
Matt: All right. You guys both make dexterity saving throws.
Wil: 16.
Liam: 16.
Matt: Wow. You manage to slowly make your way down this tunnel, almost-- what's that?
Orion: My dex was 18, by the way.
Matt: It doesn't matter; you jumped into this. You intentionally fell.
Liam: We can't even hear you anymore. You're miles away.
Matt: Yeah. You guys slowly begin to make your way down the tunnel, as you can't even hear them anymore. You guys, one after another, sliding down the slide and grime going past you. You smell in the air what smells like vegetable matter that's been long, long falling in compost, along with what smells like rancid feces mixed with mold. It's this terrible continuously growing scent.
Orion: I put up my nose scales.
Matt: Until eventually, out of the darkness, because you're ahead of everyone, you're outside of the range of his Light spell, the slime stops and there's just air.
Liam: Hey, you guys!
Matt: And a few moments of this air rushing past you as you're immediately stopped with a wet sound as you impact hard into some sort of heavy spongy matter. Thankfully, because it's spongy, you only suffer four points of damage, so you can mark that somewhere on the sheet. Mainly just from the way you landed and your armor sticks into where the plates are and just the impact was bad for your body. But you're now in darkness, looking up, sitting on what feels like you're on some sort of strange compost heap. Looking up, you see in the darkness this small light begin to appear, and you see this dragonborn--
Orion: I'm laughing, by the way.
Will: Can I try to move, since I hear him laughing, can I try to move out of the way?
Matt: You roll out of the way as the two of you scream down. With the light that now shines you can see this is a cylindrical cistern of some kind. It is a tunnel that is very tall, and you both impact into the same heap.
Liam: Shitter's full!
Orion: As we land, I look around. Oh, that was a lot of fun. I cast Prestidigitation three times in a row and clean us all up.
Matt: You try and clean what you can, but you guys are like knee to nearly waist deep as you get up and move around--
Orion: Or at least our faces.
Matt: Your faces are clean.
Will: What a wonderful smell you've discovered.
Matt: And it's a terrible smell. This room is quite honestly a mixture of long-rotting food, of dried vegetation that has been discarded here for whatever reason, a lot of it's hay and thatch that has been just rotting and molding for god knows how many years, and quite honestly, feces from some indeterminate entity.
Marisha: I use my Druidcraft to take out some of my sage and light it and spread some of my sage around.
Orion: You're making it worse. Now it's smoky and smells. Prestidigitate it out of my face.
Matt: As you guys are doing this, you guys are making your way down the tunnel. And you have a ways to catch up to them, you do hear (squeaking). You hear this, and as you look around with the light you can see little bits of movement leaping through this heap.
Liam: Rat horde.
Will: Rats are going to be wonderful.
Matt: Then suddenly, thrusting out of some of this heap, you see a large arm or tendril, brownish-tan in color just slams onto the side of it.
Orion: Oh shit. I go invisible.
Will: You've got to help-- where the hell did he go?
Matt: At which point you now see emerging from it two of these giant tendrils, which at the end are covered in these long, teeth-like spines, grasping the sides of this stone cylinder, pulling itself out of the refuse, shaking as it pulls itself forward. You now see the body that contains it with one third central tendril that rises up, what looks like creepy eyes or nose-holes that are looking around and glancing at both of you, and you see emerging beneath that the body, this large, eight- to ten-foot-thick, wide, covered-in-slime body that is this gargantuan toothy maw that opens up with a tongue that lolls out. And that's where we're going to go ahead and end today's session. We'll pick it up next week right where we left off. You guys slowly making your way down the tunnel. We'll pick up with that next time.
Will: Toothy maw is where we end it!
Matt: Yep. Toothy maw.
Marisha: Tentacley, brown, twitchy eyeball, toothy maw. That's all we know?
Matt: That's all you know. And some sort of strange sound and other small things moving.
Wil: Do you give out prizes for the most ones rolled in a night, because I'm pretty sure I won that.
Matt: I do, and for that prize I give you a fancy yellow d20.
Wil: Oh! Thank you. That's great. Does it have all ones on it?
Matt: Shit. Yeah. How did that happen?
Marisha: Oh, that's been your problem the whole time.
Liam: Congratulations, you've won imploding self-esteem.
Wil: That stacks, right? I already have that. I mean, it would be silly if I couldn't-- is that an ongoing? Because that's a feat I took when I started.
Matt: Yeah, yeah, I tried to tell you not to take that but, you know, character flavor is important.
Wil: Listen, it's a class feature. It's an actor's class feature.
Liam: After enough time, you can suck people into it.
Matt: Well, guys, thank you so much!
Wil: Thanks, Matt. That was amazing.
Matt: That was a fun first round. Got one more session with you guys.
Marisha: Yes, and what did you think of your first game?
Will: It was incredible, nothing should be this fun. Seriously, it was so much fun. Yeah. Awesome.
Matt: Well guys, thank you, I'm so glad you could join us and I'm excited for next week. And thank you guys for tuning in, hope you're enjoying it as much as we are. We can't stay too long, unfortunately, I have a flight to catch very soon to fly out to a convention in Columbus, Ohio. Zac, I think, is around here with whatever we got in business we've got to get down to with all you awesome people. Thank-yous.
Zac: We'll save gifts for next week.
Matt: We'll have to save gifts for next week when we're not quite in such a huge rush, so for those of you who sent stuff, we'll get into those next week. Thank you so much. So for people who donated, by the way, once again donated to 826LA, which is our charity, which is a fantastic charity that takes young children and young adults and teaches them creative writing and writing skills and they do wonderful work.

Marisha: We're going to be doing a video very soon going to 826 and telling you guys all about it. But yes, they're a great charity, so yes.
Matt: Give to them the hefty amount that you guys have contributed over this time towards their charity. It's fascinating.
Will: You guys have incredible fans. This whole week leading up to this on Twitter and everything, you guys have amazing fans.
Marisha: Now you guys get the fanart!
Will: Sorry about what?
Matt: Sorry about the DDOS attack. That's how we say hi.
Will: No, seriously, it's amazing.
Zac: Don't even mention things like that. Don't mention those things.
Wil: It's more of a hug.
Zac: Thank you everybody for helping us get to 6k. They've already started a stupid e-mail chain talking about what musical songs they're going to sing.
Marisha: That's amazing. Oh, and guys, Mary Elizabeth came back to visit and watch. So she did return.
Mary: Hi!
Marisha: She's back!
Mary: And a special guest.
Steve: I'm just going to troll. Hi.
Marisha: Steven Blum, everybody.
Will: Starscream himself is here.
Marisha: Yes, he is.
Matt: Thank you so much for coming to watch, I hope you enjoyed yourselves. Yeah, it's an incredible time, looking forward to the session next week. Are there any other closing comments you guys want to bust out tonight?
Marisha: I don't want to wait a week.
Wil: Really fun and really weird to be on this side of that screen. So odd for me, and just to play a character who's so different from the characters I used to play before I DMed all the time. It's weird to be a guy who just doesn't think about stuff and like is not particularly charismatic and anyway, people who have thought about playing or want to play RPGs, when we were rolling up this guy, I was so excited when I got-- what did I roll for him? Anyway he's got a minus one. I rolled an eight for his charisma, and I was so excited because I was like, well now I know exactly who this guy is. I know exactly who he is and it's going to be really fun to be him. It was really great, it was really fun to come and I found out about your game because Liam directed me in a voice session. I want to be on your show so much.
Matt: Well, now it is done. Dreams do come true. Then we smash them.
Will: Now roll a one and get us out of here.
Wil: I'll try, but since it's not going to count, I don't know.
Liam: It'll be a 20. 19. (laughter)
Matt: Thanks so much. We'll see you next week, 7PM on the Twitch stream. Have a wonderful week.
Marisha: Bye!

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to Critical Role! Tonight, we return from last week's rather tense cliffhanger of a game. Really excited to get that underway. But for those who this is your first time watching, this is a show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. We roll dice, and it's fun. So yeah, we're excited to have you. Let's take it off with some announcements at the top of the show for everyone. First and foremost, we have under an hour until the sale for the temporary special edition #IsItThursdayYet shirts are no longer available. We're pushing in the mid-900s, and see if we can hit a thousand before the hour is up, guys. So if you haven't got one and you're interested, we'll have information in the chat for it. That's our hashtag Is It Thursday Yet shirts soon will be gone forever. So grab one if you want. Also, this marks the anniversary of Team Hoomanism. You guys have been amazing since the beginning of the whole community, through Felicia and starting the whole stream thing. It's been amazing to watch this whole community come together, and part of that celebration for today is go out there and tweet hashtag-- What's the hashtag on this one, Luke?
Lucas: Hoomanism.
Matt: Look at that. #Hoomanism. That's pretty easy to remember if you're not me. Write a story about a good deed you did this week. Something that you felt really good about, that you brought a little more joy and positivity to the world around you, or saw somebody else do. Just go ahead and tweet with that hashtag, and at some point during tonight's show we're going to be giving away one of our Critical Role shirts that I'm modeling for you, strangely, accidentally for this, but I figure now you know what it looks like on a relatively unfit male.
Taliesin: Bear not included.
Matt: Bear not included, for now. So go ahead and guys, take a look at that, go ahead and put some positive vibes out there in the twittersphere about what you've experienced this year or done this week, and see if you can get yourself a shirt. I think it will be a lot of fun. Also, wanted to remind everyone that we will be at New York Comic Con, which will be October 10th and 11th. We'll be doing some cool events on Saturday as Critical Role, doing some signings, and we're trying to see what logistics we can do to have an opportunity to see some of you guys who weren't able to get passes. We'll have more information coming up soon, hopefully. Because we'd love to be able to see you guys who couldn't make it in the actual convention. We'll figure something out. So keep your eye on the Internet as things progress. Also, let's see. Liam, if you want to go ahead?
Liam: Yeah I just wanted to, I talked about this last week. I'll probably talk about it next week, but I wanted to encourage you guys if you haven't already to go over to Joe Madureira's Kickstarter for their Battle Chasers game, Battle Chasers: Nightwar. Joe's a friend of mine; he's a comic book legend, and is also a game developer and artist, and I'm just a big fan, and so they're a friend of the show, a lot of us here are in love with Joe-- physically, not his art, just him himself. He's a handsome man.
Laura: He's got a hashtag thing going. Right. Now. So #BattleChasers, too, that's an awesome thing.
Liam: And they, they, hit their goal almost immediately. They're just now making the game that is going to be shinier because they're climbing higher. But just go take a look, his art style is unmatched, and the game is based, is an RPG based in the JRPGs of our youth, and it's going to be great. Go take a look.
Matt: Yeah. Thank you, Liam. Also, while our esteemed Ashley Johnson has been away for some time, and our cleric has been missing, she's been doing cool stuff in New York, filming for the new show Blindspot. Which just aired earlier this week. So for those of you who want to catch our awesome gnome cleric on the fancy big screen you can go ahead and check out Blindspot, that airs Monday nights on--
Laura: NBC. At I think ten our time?
Matt: Probably. I should know this by how much they've been promoting it everywhere. You can't avoid the posters, so I should know. So yeah, check that out. We're hoping that maybe she manages to scoot some Critical Role references or memorabilia onto the screen sometime. Fingers crossed. Also, we're going to have at the intermission today a really cool video that is a presentation of when we visited and delivered the esteemed check donation to 826LA that you guys made possible. We'll have that shown at the break today. It will give you a really clear idea of the charity 826LA, what it looks like, the people that are there, and a lot of the kids that are involved, and what you've helped continue to promote and help grow. So look forward to that at the break. It's going to be good. Does anyone have anything else they want to announce?
Orion: I have two quick announcements. Hello, everyone. Greetings and salutations. My first announcement is that I will be sitting on Zac's face this whole game. I have found the pillow.
Marisha: I'm sitting on his unicorn stomach.
Taliesin: I've got the feet.
Laura: Oh, is that what you've got?
Matt: I couldn't tell if he was blushing before or after you revealed you were sitting on his face. It's hard to tell.
Orion: I think it's after.
Matt: Yeah, probably. He's pretty cute.
Orion: I know this is because I farted already. And everybody check out my Twitch channel with my name.
Matt: There you go. All righty. We're waiting on our esteemed gnome bard to arrive, due to traffic, and when he does, we have a little present for him, which we will reveal when he arrives. But in the meantime, let's go ahead and kick things off for tonight's episode of Critical Role.
Taliesin: I'm not ready! [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. (laughter)
Matt: Oh, it is a well-oiled machine, Critical Role.
Taliesin: We all trade seats and then come back really quickly.
Matt: It's pretty good. We started doing burpees in between. No, I mean, we just burp.
Laura: Basically, just burp a lot.
Liam: Hey, the gnome is at the door. Can someone let the gnome in?
Matt: Bring in the gnome!
Travis: Do you desire a gnome, sire?
Matt: I would like the gnome brought before me.
Travis: Bring the king a gnome! Make sure he is of foul mouth and many a song.
Liam: Oh, fetching the gnome!
Travis: I assure you, sire, this gnome has many songs, a very tiny instrument, and--
Taliesin: I feel so dirty sitting on this pillow. So comfy.
Orion: I like it.
Laura: Does somebody have an extra pencil?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: All I have is this broken one from Grog.
Travis: In solidarity.
Matt: I appreciate that you brought it back.
Travis: Nothing's changed.
Matt: No, it's a reminder. Yay! (cheering)
Travis: Sam, buddy! You made it.
Sam: Oh my gosh. Okay, I'd like to plug a few things. No.
Matt: However, we do have a present for you. Because there have been periods of time in which you've complained about not having a proper stein or mug to match the rest of the group, we figure--
Sam: I've got a Google one.
Matt: Google one works fine. But thanks to some of our wondrous, illustrious campmates we were with at Burning Man, they gifted this unto us to gift unto you, as we felt it was fitting and size-appropriate.
Sam: Oh, yes! Yes, it makes me look cute! (laughter)
Liam: You have to measure that out in a regular cup first, and then pour it in.
Travis: You could pour two whole drinks in there, and it would be half an inch of liquid.
Sam: Wow, this thing's amazing!
Marisha: So thanks, post-nuclear family.
Matt: Well done.
Travis: (laughter) That is amazing.
Sam: It's a hotel ice thing.
Marisha: Yeah, it's technically an ice bucket.
Sam: I want to fill it up right now.
Laura: It's hiding your face.
Matt: All righty, so to get caught up on what has transpired: the party, after traveling abroad in the distant city of Vasselheim and the surrounding lands, eventually returned to Emon, their central hub city where they had their Greyskull Keep constructed, to relax and take in a brief moment of respite before learning that the Briarwoods, two individuals responsible for much darkness and sadness in the history of Percy, were coming to court in a week to feast and talk with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei. What are you doing?
Travis: Lock it up! Jeez.
Sam: I poured a whole glass in there and it looks like nothing!
Matt: You got to keep pouring. Upon hearing of the Briarwoods' arrival within a week to discuss political matters and enjoy a feast, of course the members of Vox Machina, who are part of the council in Tal'Dorei were invited. Within that week, they made their various preparations, made the various beard checks, made the various beard shavings. It happened! And made their way to the central palace at the Cloudtop District of Emon. The Briarwoods arrived, a feast was put out. However, Percy went in under an illusion to look like Vax over here, while Vax went invisible. Everyone had formal attire on, weapons left at the door, unarmored, dressed for the occasion.
Sam: Is that true, no armor?
Matt: Yeah, you guys were all dressed in formal attire.
Travis: We don't even have any weapons.
Sam: Do I need to subtract things from--?
Travis: The recap makes it so much better. Just lay it out.
Matt: So your weapons are at the door. They're not on you at the moment.
Laura: They're at the door? We left them at the door?
Matt: Yeah, as part of the check-in process.
Liam: Question, mine are on me, right?
Matt: Yeah. Because you went invisible and you were under the approval of Seeker Asum.
Liam: You just increased my chances by 2%. Thank you.
Laura: And Percy, your weapons are still on you because you already had an illusion on you, right?
Matt: Correct. The List is on him, his Pepperbox. Bad News would be a bit difficult for you to bring in here.
Taliesin: Diplomacy would work out well, though.
Matt: Yeah, I think so. During the feast, conversations were had, questions were raised and information was extracted. Seeker Asum had requested to have been met in the foyer by our rogue here, who forgot and then decided to go on his own upstairs following the Briarwoods to the second floor where their guest room was set. He distracted one of the guards with his serpent belt, knocked out the other, entered the room and found himself face to face with the Briarwoods themselves.
Liam: That did not lead to further hallway, in fact that just led to a bedroom. It ended right there.
Matt: Yeah. It went right into their guest room. So after a brief discussion, a little bit of awkwardness, you attempted to leave, but were placed in a holding pattern by a Hold Person spell, and had the two Briarwoods come up to you, whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry about, you look delicious.
Sam: Yeah, there's nothing to worry about.
Liam: They're kind of hot.
Laura: Right? I mean, they are hot, right? So at least there's that.
Travis: What are we doing while this is happening?
Matt: You guys are just now leaving the feast hall at this period of time.
Orion: Where are we entering to?
Matt: A large foyer area. There's the main foyer of the palace that splits off to two smaller meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is what leads to the Grand Hall. That's where you guys were feasting. So you're making your way into this--
Taliesin: Hasum?
Matt: Asum? Seeker Asum, yes.
Taliesin: Seeker Asum. Is he around? Do we see him anywhere?
Matt: No.
Sam: Tell me this, DM. When my Invisibility spell is broken, am I alerted? Do I know that? Do I sense it?
Matt: The spell itself would dissipate, as it is a concentration spell. It would be a, oh, spell's gone. However, before we get to you guys. We have more immediate business to attend to.
Liam: Let's play, Matt. Let's play.
Matt: Vax. Your muscles lock in place, sweat beginning to bead down the front of your forehead. The realization of the immediate danger you put yourself in washing over you. You can see across the way, in the dark candlelit area of the room by the canopy bed, is Lady Delilah Briarwood, hand still out, smiling at you. Immediately to your left shoulder is Lord Sylas Briarwood, who has leaned in. He's actually pulling you away from the door now. You're skidding across the ground (dragging sound) as he shifts you, your legs unable to actually move. As he pulls you forward, the Lord whispers in your ear, "You are a curious one, though not quite gifted with the silver tongue. Foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest of the Briarwoods." For a moment, there's this pause, this tension, the silence, and Delilah, Lady Briarwood, puts her hand out further and says, "Yet, my love, we are not here to make enemies, nor raise suspicion. We are merely protecting ourselves from intrusion. Isn't that right?" As she looks at you, and looks immediately to your right, where you can feel the general presence of Lord Briarwood. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw.
Sam: First roll. Not an unimportant one.
Orion: Not at all.
Sam: First roll of the night. Could kill Liam.
Laura: No. That's good!
Liam: That's 18.
Travis: What was that? How much?
Liam: I'm frozen!
Laura: 18, he said.
Matt: You feel your muscles lax, and the sweat that is still brimming across your face you feel for the first time in these moments that seem to stretch on forever. You have control of your body, though you do feel the hand of Lord Briarwood right on your shoulder, who, as you become conscious of the fact that you are in control of your physical form, his voice comes very heavily, the bass kicking into your left ear. "Indeed. We do require allies. I would have you prove friendship." And as he takes and moves the shoulder away, you find your torso moving towards him. You lock eyes with him, and he has this knowing grin, his lids taut slightly with this condescending sense of knowing. I need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw. This is technically a charm effect, and you being a half-elf, you do, I believe, get advantage on those.
Liam: That is a 21.
Matt: 21. You feel an extension of the sheer unnatural force of charisma that attempts to penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that Vax holds to such a high esteem... However, you manage to resist it and feel it wash over you as the slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to try.
Sam: Ooh. What was he trying? Who knows?
Matt: There's a brief moment as he looks you over.
Liam: What do you need?
Marisha: Yes. That's so smart.
Matt: "There now. Be a good boy." Looks over. I need you to make a deception check.
Liam: Deception check. Okay, I'm using Luck to go again.
Matt: Now you used a couple Luck points last time.
Liam: Yeah, I used one. I did a lot last game, but we were over multiple days. I used one this day. I'm about to use my second. (gagging noise) Okay, this is deception?
Matt: Deception, yes.
Liam: Ooh, that's not as great. That's a 15.
Matt: 15, okay. Gives you a look. "Very well. Apparently, the help was not very helpful." At which point, you hear this fast knock at the door, and you hear a voice go, "Are you all right? Is everyone all right?" Behind the door. At which point, Lady Briarwood just does this with her finger, and the door swings open (creak) on its own. The guard that ran after your belt is standing there holding the groggy, just slightly coming to second guard that you knocked out, and as he pulls him towards the door, he looks over and sees this, and he goes, drops him, and goes for his weapon, and Lord Briarwood puts his hand up, and goes, "Do not worry. We're just having a conversation. Close the door. And get him up." "Yes, not a worry sir." And he closes the door, and you hear the scuffling behind the wood of him, adjusting and waking up the guard who you had clobbered in the side of the head, getting him to consciousness. So they're both just looking you over. Lord Briarwood's just walking back and forth, keeping a very keen eye. He walks between you and the door. As you stand there. Almost like he's waiting for a reaction of some kind, for you to initiate something.
Liam: Thank you so much. Thank you so much! What can I do to help? I'm pretty meager a servant, but anything you need, whatever you need! Gosh, you guys are good-looking. (laughter)
Liam: It isn't that, is it?
Matt: You hear a throaty chuckle from Lady Briarwood across the way. (chuckles) "No, but what do you think, my love?" Lord Briarwood comes up from behind, his hands on the back of your shoulder, and says, "Like we said, you haven't the gift of the silver tongue. But I applaud your effort."
Liam: Well, my mom and dad said I'm a real good speaker. They paid for a tutor? To teach me how to talk. And it's worked out really well for me in my life. So if you need an ambassador, or a butler who talks? I could do that for you.
Matt: Lady Briarwood at this point steps a couple steps closer. She's still about 15 feet from you. He's right behind you. Right between you and the door. She steps forward and looks over at her husband again, and goes, "What do you think? Can we trust him?" And Lord Briarwood leans forward, and you can feel his chin peeking into your peripheral vision. "I'm afraid not. It seems--"
Liam: Well, here's the thing you need to know about Uriel. And I take a step back.
Matt: Into him?
Liam: No! Away.
Matt: He's between you and the door.
Liam: Well, does he hold me if I turn? Well, I just said that, right? Here's the thing about Uriel.
Matt: As you go to move away, his arms that are on your shoulder, tighten, flex, and hold you in place.
Liam: Oh, you don't want to know? Okay, I'll just save that for later.
Sam: Roll for coy.
Liam: Roll for what, Matt?
Matt: Since I don't know what you're going to say, I'm going to say persuasion for this. Because I don't know if it's a deception or not.
Travis: Is the power out of the DM's hands for a moment?
Liam: Oh, I'm going to use my last Luck of the day!
Travis: The last one?
Liam: Last Luck of the day.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: Okay, this is persuasion? That's 17.
Travis: That was a big die.
Liam: You could give me a-- never mind.
Matt: You want an inspiration?
Liam: Huh? No.
Matt: (laughs) What are you asking for? What are you begging from the DM?
Liam: Yeah, no, that's why I said never mind.
Travis: Is it begging or is it praying, at this point?
Matt: No, I'll give inspiration when you've goddamn earned it. As you say that looking at them with this coy look of information about Uriel, they both chuckle in unison. (chuckles) "Shall we?" And she gives a nod and goes, "I think we shall."
Liam: Can I roll for initiative?
Matt: We're now rolling for initiative.
Marisha: Fuck!
Travis: Does he have an earring?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So. Here you are, right there. Lord Briarwood is behind you. Lady Briarwood is over here by the edge of the bed. These are the two windows, this is the layout of the room here. As far as you are aware, there are two guards outside the door, currently.
Liam: My initiative can only be described as fecal.
Matt: Oh no.
Laura: It wasn't a one.
Liam: Wasn't a one.
Matt: One adjacent, is what you're telling me.
Liam: Six, it was six. It comes close.
Orion: I thought you were out of there, man.
Matt: All right. So. For this, Delilah steps forward, and you can see there's a slight flash of bluish-purple arcane energy in her eyes and her fingers, coalesce around, as she does, she draws her fingers up and you feel this sudden cold pressure around your body. I need to pull out my spells. I don't know what I'm doing here.
Liam: Should I check my iPhone, too?
Laura: He's pulling up his spells.
Taliesin: He hasn't had time to memorize all the ways he's going to fuck with you. There are that many ways.
Matt: All right, so I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, Vax.
Liam: 19.
Matt: 19. All right. So as she does this you feel all the flesh on your torso and around the neck part of your body all of a sudden begin to dry and crack as if your life force itself is beginning to wither and be drawn out. It's the equivalent of a plant drying out and dying very fast, but it's your flesh instead. You go ahead and take--
Marisha: Sounds like Blight or something.
Matt: You take 21 points of necrotic damage, and she's going to go ahead and step this way. After that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post at the side of the bed and looks at you with this grin. At that point as you tense from the pain, Sylas immediately whips to one side and with an unarmed claw attack, a giant fist is going to hit you on the side of your torso. That is going to be a 21 to hit.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: All right. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage as his fist socks you on the inside of your chest area hitting the sternum, and you feel like a slight pain crack sound as it hits and impacts against the leather. As you pull forward, with unnatural speed (whoosh) the hands are back on your shoulder and you hear this little voice say, "Bon Appetit." That is going to be a 25 to hit. All right. Okay, you take six points of piercing damage as suddenly you feel two extremely sharp, warm prongs jut into the side of your neck, and that same cold sensation you felt across your torso all of a sudden begins to pull from the neck, and you feel as if the very warm blood around your throat begins to drain from it. You take an additional 12 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are currently reduced by 12.
Marisha: Oh ho! They're sucking the life out of you.
Matt: It's your turn.
Liam: He's holding me, right?
Matt: Actually, this will be part of his unarmed attack. No. He does not have you grappled, currently. He's over the shoulders.
Liam: Okay. As a bonus action I'm going to use rogue's cunning action to disengage, which means nobody can swipe at me if I run, okay.
Marisha: (whispering) Jenga!
Liam: There's a window. Last week, you said there was a window to the courtyard.
Matt: There are two windows on each side of the room there.
Liam: Okay. I'm running straight at the window, and as I run-- yeah, past them, and I don't go anywhere near her, and I'm using dash, and I'm leaping out the window and saying, jenga.
Travis: Jenga!
Matt: (window breaking) As you run past, you can see there's this moment where it's almost like they are letting it happen. There is no momentary aggression or frustration to this as you dart and (crashing) out the window falling from the second story. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: That is a 32.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Do I even stop running?
Matt: (chuckles) You hit the ground with a tumble, and you get up and you continue to move forward. So at this point you've pushed into the courtyard now. You can see the cobblestone road that surrounds the outskirts of the palace. There are a few bits of light and you can see there is the carriage they came in, horses still attached, and the younger man who led them inside who was driving the coach is napping on the front, who is now looking over, spooked, at the sound of shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground around you. And that ends your turn. Everyone else, you hear jenga whispered through those of you who have the earrings on.
Sam: He's in trouble! Let's go!
Marisha: What's going on?
Taliesin: Now we hear shattering glass, don't we?
Matt: Not from this part of the palace. You're too far away.
Laura: I start running towards the door to grab weapons. And I'm saying into my ear, where are you? What's going on?
Sam: I'm by the bartender saying, I ordered a large. Please, can I have a slightly larger one please? What? Oh! Oh shit!
Marisha: I'm going to go eagle, and I start scouting the halls looking for him.
Taliesin: I'm running with them towards the doors
Liam: I don't know. Am I able to talk further?
Matt: That's about as much as you got out this combat round because it was a very quick series. It took all your effort to even get out of that situation.
Travis: She and I are booking it for the door.
Matt: So you guys go forward. You run towards the front and the weapons are being held in this storage area off to the side that is used for storing weaponry and armor for people who arrive and shouldn't be wearing them in very social events. So you guys head that way. You're getting a big drink.
Marisha: I'm heading to wherever I saw the Briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving.
Taliesin: Actually, did you turn into an eagle? Can you carry me?
Marisha: No, you're big. I can take the gnomes.
Taliesin: That's fine; I need to get my gun. anyway.
Matt: You burst through the hall and head up the way. As you do, you can see some of the other servants glance around, suddenly.
Marisha: I poop on one of them as I go over.
Matt: As you you're gliding up the staircase and onto the second floor, there are two servants. One darts out of the way.
Marisha: It's one of the Briarwoods' servants, right? Oh, no. I want to save it for if I fly over one of the Briarwoods. Never mind. It's fine.
Matt: We'll let it go. So as you coast up, releasing your avian payload on the stairs, you can see, looking jarred and confused, a human woman, brown hair, freckles, mousy-looking servant looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of her shoulder.
Marisha: (caws) That's me saying sorry.
Orion: I see what's going on. You're flying? I cast Fly on myself. I follow suit behind her, and as I'm passing by the person she shat on, I cast Prestidigitation on her. Sorry about that!
Matt: Okay, the Keyleth spatter vanishes through arcane means. However, the servant begins to give chase up the stairs after you guys. Not angrily, just following to see where the action is going. All right, you head over to meet up with them to grab your weaponry. Although your weapon was probably on you.
Taliesin: Bad News.
Matt: So you go ahead and grab Bad News and pull it off the side. That's your guys' action now, so as you are out front, Lady Briarwood is going to right at the window. Looks down for a second, and I need you to make another wisdom saving throw.
Liam: That's a 13.
Matt: 13? So as you get up and you say jenga. A familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once again lock into place and you fall over from the momentum of the run, going face-down into the cold, dew-covered grass in this courtyard area, unable to move.
Liam: (muffled) Fucking bitch!
Matt: In a similar dash fashion and leaping out of the broken window that you left, Lord Briarwood (impact) onto the ground next to you. Three-point landing, stands up over you with this grin. That will be his turn though. At this point in time, one of the bookcases-- you hear this sound real fast, this sound of wood being slammed open, and a surprised noise. That's all you hear from your perspective in the distance. All right, so as you guys get your weapons you begin going where?
Laura: I guess running towards the Briarwoods' room.
Matt: Where you saw them leave? You head up the stairway, following behind where you saw Keyleth and Tiberius rush off to. Are you following the rest of them?
Sam: Yeah. I put my mug down and I start little leg waddling towards them. As I go, I'm going to send a message. I use Message to-- who's the guy who likes us?
Liam: My name is Vax.
Sam: No, not him. Sylas? No, not Sylas! Seeker Asum?
Matt: Seeker Asum, with Message? I believe the person has to be within visual range. Wait, no. You can cast through solid objects if you're familiar with the target and nobody on the barrier. It's 120 foot, though. You don't know how far he is. You could give it a shot.
Sam: Okay, I say, something's gone awry. We may need you right away.
Matt: The message is delivered out into the space. Hopefully, it found its recipient.
Laura: As I'm running towards the Briarwoods' room, I start shouting Uriel! and grab a servant and say, go find Uriel. Tell him there's enemies within the gates, in the castle. Now!
Matt: "Yes, Lady Vex. Right away." Runs off. You guys coast up the stairs. Right as you reach the top of the hallway over here, you can see there are two guards that are currently standing at the door.
Travis: I stay at the front door.
Marisha: Is the door open?
Matt: The door is currently closed, but you're in eagle form, so you're going to be doing like eagles do. I'll say, you're about there because you were a little bit ahead of them. Those are the two guards right there. At this point now, as this is happening, I need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative.
Marisha: That's okay. Thanks, Percy. Ten.
Orion: 17.
Matt: And Keyleth? Keyleth, you got ten, you said?
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: Okay, so after that current circumstance, that brings us-- as they're rushing up, you would be finishing off the last round, so you can make another wisdom check.
Liam: I failed it.
Matt: Okay. You can just see the little bit of moonlight up in the sky. It is this ominous image of not knowing if your friends are coming, not knowing what's happening. All you know is you cannot move your physical form, and looming over you is Lord Briarwood, standing and beginning to move in to kneel. That will end your turn. All right, that brings us to the top of the round. This will bring us to Lady Delilah, who is now going to step out of the glass, leap down, try to catch herself. And falls flat on her ass. Smacks down, (grunts). Gets herself up from the ground. Yeah, she has to use the rest of her movement getting back up from prone, at that point. She's right there, but you see now, in the window above her, a small humanoid figure. A familiar one that was waiting for you earlier in the foyer, who apparently was hiding inside one of the dressers inside the room.
Laura: Seeker!
Matt: He's there. Lady Briarwood is going to take the rest of her turn. She has one action left. With this, she looks over to you and says, "When we mark a target, he does not escape, I'm afraid." I'm going to see what this does. All right, I need you to make another constitution saving throw.
Liam: Nine.
Laura: Start rolling different dice!
Liam: The universe is random and doesn't care about you and me.
Marisha: Life lessons by Critical Role.
Sam: Stay in school, kids.
Matt: You take 34 points of necrotic damage.
Liam: I'm unconscious. I haven't been knocked out in ages.
Matt: You go unconscious, then when it comes back to your next turn, you have to make a death saving throw. If you fail three--
Liam: Right, so it's only if it exceeds my hit point maximum that I'm killed outright, so I'm unconscious.
Matt: You are unconscious.
Liam: Hey, guys. I'm unconscious.
Marisha: So that means he never got his "I'm right here" message out.
Matt: Nope.
Laura: But we know he's in the room. That's where we're all heading.
Marisha: Well, he's not in the room. He's in the front yard, at this point. So we are heading to the room.
Liam: Wait. As that happens, and as my consciousness fades away, I don't say anything, but here's what I think in a split-second. I think of my friends that I have spent so much time with. I think of Keyleth, beautiful, walking under the trees. I think of my twin sister as a young girl, folding up linens with our mother. I think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons, smarter than me. I think of the woman she grew into. Hiking over many, many, many miles together. My best friend. My best friend, Vex'ahlia. And before I can think no more, I say a prayer to Sarenrae to watch over my friends and keep them safe.
Matt: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Eight.
Matt: With that thought cast out, the darkness swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you into the cold, wet grass on the floor of the courtyard surrounding the palace. A small shiver runs down your spine, Vex: a feeling you haven't felt before. A feeling of sudden and immediate sourceless dread, and in that instant you know that there is almost no time.
Laura: Can I use Hunter's Mark and sense where Lady Briarwood is at that moment?
Matt: Yeah, she is actually at this point, beyond the palace walls. You can sense and knowing the palace walls. You were expecting a second floor, it's that direction but just outside the walls of the palace. And you guys just got your weapons.
Laura: I take off running in that direction.
Matt: I'm going to have people who haven't rolled initiative yet, go ahead and roll initiative so I can put you on the timing chart here. Grog?
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, nice.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17? Look at you guys.
Taliesin: 16.
Laura: I hadn't rolled, actually, for that. I hadn't rolled initiative yet. 18.
Matt: You guys are coming up into the hallway at this point. Let's see. All right, Vex and Grog, you rush out into the courtyard area, making your way out of the front. Some of the guards can see you dart out and they go to stop you, but they see you going where they're going, they recognize you and let you pass. So that will be for Scanlan, Grog, and Vex'ahlia, your turn is making your way around the outside, using a full run action. You haven't crested the outside of the palace yet. You don't see anything, but you are starting to make your way around the corner.
Laura: Can I use my earring during that? I tell Keyleth and Tiberius that I think they are outside the palace walls.
Orion: Copy that.
Sam: Did I hear that?
Matt: Do you have your ear pieces on? Then yeah, you would.
Sam: Then I don't run. I Dimension Door outside of the palace wall.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and make an intelligence check. Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.
Sam: Not good. Oh, wait.
Travis: Seeing how fast she's running, I go into a rage.
Sam: Oh, wait. It says I have advantage on intelligence saving throws. This is not a saving throw. Then no, eight.
Matt: Eight? So you manage to Dimension Door--
Sam: Into an outhouse!
Matt: As opposed to being directly outside, because you haven't seen this part of the palace, you're not really 100% visual range; you haven't visited this side. You end up trying to come over in this area. You end up appearing right up here inside the room, looking at the window and you can see down. Suddenly you look about this room. To the left of you is Seeker Asum, who doesn't even notice you are there. He is currently putting away a crossbow. Looking out the glass window, you can see down with the little bit of light that's in the courtyard. You see Lord Sylas Briarwood looming over what looks to be the currently unconscious body of Vax'ildan.
Marisha: That's right, it's dark outside.
Matt: Yes, it is. Bringing us to this point now, that's your guys' turn. Tiberius? You're up.
Orion: Does anyone have eyes on Vax? Anyone?!
Sam: I do! Do I?
Laura: Yeah, you do.
Sam: I think I do.
Orion: Where are you, Scanlan?
Sam: Inside a room. I don't know where I am. It's a nice-looking room.
Orion: I assume you're in their chambers. I'll be right there. Fireball to those guys right there! (explosion sound)
Matt: Right there? All right, go ahead and roll damage! Yeah, they did not make their saving throws.
Orion: I wanted to say real quick, right before that, I got to my decanter of water and I start charging it, and then I do Fireball.
Matt: So roll your damage on that.
Orion: How much is that?
Taliesin: Will that also widen up the hole into that room?
Marisha: We'll see, I guess.
Sam: Or you could make a wall of fire.
Orion: How much is that? 35!
Matt: 35? Okay! One of them gets blasted and thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from the sheer force five foot in that direction. The one that's this side of the doorway, who was already at one hit point, barely brought from already being knocked unconscious by Vax, you hear a scream, and is turned to ash, his charred armor left clattering across the ground.
Orion: What about the door?
Matt: Both doors are blown open from the force of the explosion. A large portion of the room is currently singed with black. What's your fly speed?
Orion: 30 feet.
Matt: That's as far as you can get.
Orion: Can that dude see me from where I am?
Matt: He can currently see you, yeah.
Orion: Good. I turn to him and I'm like, you better get the hell out of my way! And that's my turn.
Matt: Okay! Make an intimidation check.
Liam: Yeah!
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Yeah!
Orion: 23!
Matt: From what you can see, the helmet itself guards part of the face, but you can see from the charred, slightly angered, gritting expression on his mouth as he looks at you as you shout that, the grittiness goes away, the jaw opens slack, and takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway. Does not appear to be interested in threatening what just blew his friend into ashes.
Travis: Cremated him!
Matt: From behind you, as you're flying over you see this servant come rushing up, the female one that you saw earlier on the stairway. Rushing forward, seemingly with an intense look of what went from curiosity to now engrossed in this current circumstance. Kit, do you want to go ahead and take your place?
Sam: Wait, what's going on? What do we see?
Orion: This is where she comes in?!
Liam: You can sit right here!
Marisha: Oh, I'm really sorry I pooped on you! I didn't know I was shitting on you!
Orion: I cleaned you up. Don't worry!
Laura: Can I ask a question? Trinket. I didn't say I left him at home. Did he wait outside of the palace during the formal dinner?
Matt: Trinket would not be at the dinner, per se.
Laura: But he would have stayed outside at the palace, right?
Matt: Trinket would probably be kept somewhere near the stables, where the people can watch over your animals.
Liam: He eats at the table with us all the time!
Matt: Not in the middle of the grand hall of the palace of Tal'Dorei, sorry.
Liam: She taught him to sit in a chair.
Matt: As you rush in, you see this giant fireball blast through the middle of the hallway. Two of the guards are sent off to the side. There's this hurried look and this shout. You've seen these individuals throughout the palace before, and they're part of the council. You've always kept a distance from them. You're a servant of the palace; you want to keep up appearances for many reasons. However, there's this rush of energy and this general sense of dread in this corner of the palace. And for the most part, judging by this, you didn't like the Briarwoods when they arrived, and you think things are going wrong here. What are you going to do with your turn?
Kit: Can I join in the fray?
Matt: You're right over here in the hallway. It's hard to see from this perspective here, but you're right over here.
Kit: Okay.
Sam: DM, who is this person who's just joined us? For the audience.
Matt: This is Kit Buss, who's our official artist for Critical Role. (cheering)
Matt: In from the UK to join us for one session of awesomeness.
Orion: That's the United Kingdom.
Taliesin: Where the real accents come from!
Sam: She's going to be doing the worst American accent possible.
Liam: What's going on around here?
Matt: You're over here. There's this guard here, and these doorways are blown open and seems to be where all the energy's going. You have a good sense for the flow of energy and emotional tension, and right now everything is pushing in that direction.
Kit: Okay, can I use my turn to dash to get through the doors?
Matt: That'll get you right there. You can just look past the doors, and they're blown open. That'll be your turn there. As you glance inside, you can see the gnome member of Vox Machina is there currently at the edge of one window. The left window is shattered on this side. Seeker Asum, another part of the council, is right at that. He looks over his shoulder, looks at you and goes, "Shoo!" You see him look like, what are you doing, no go! Go, stupid servant! That's your turn. All right. That brings us to Percy.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You were rushing outside with them or rushing up the stairs?
Taliesin: Rushing outside with them.
Matt: Okay, you'll just catch up with them. They're on the outskirts, just cresting around the side of the palace here. All right.
Taliesin: Am I just there, or am I off the map?
Matt: You're, in theory, off the map on this side. I'll get to that shortly. You're rushing as fast as you can. You exited the front of the palace and spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can around the side. It's a long distance, putting all your energy into it.
Taliesin: I have a very long range.
Matt: You have no visual, unfortunately. That brings us to Sylas.
Travis: That dick!
Matt: All right. No, sorry. Before Sylas is the Seeker. Seeker Asum.
Laura: Seeker Awesome?
Matt: Asum! He's pretty awesome. He's going to leap down here. He's going to make his own acrobatics check, which he does with flying colors because rangers are cool like that. Lands immediately and angrily rushes forward going, "No!" and attempts to feint into an attack, and Lord Briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to deflect with preternatural speed just (whoosh) out of the way. Asum, instead, reaches down to grab the unconscious body of Vax and is going to attempt to move you away from here. Sylas does get an attack of opportunity against you. That's a 16?
Liam: Do I make a death saving throw?
Matt: What's your armor class?
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17. Unconscious. I'll say there's no dex bonus to that because you can't move out of the way, so that would be 15. I'm sorry, 12. It hits you; I rolled for that. You immediately take a death saving throw. Instantaneously. You failed one. Now, it is Sylas's turn. That was Seeker Asum, now it's--
Laura: Seeker's turn and Sylas got to take a turn!
Matt: He got a free attack because he moved out of range to try to hit him. Rushes up to join the fray there. He's going to look towards Seeker Asum and say, "This quarrel is not with you." Asum looks over his shoulder. Asum relaxes his grip on Vax's body and stands at attention. And you hear him say, "My apologies, I did not mean to meddle." He seems to be stepping out of the fray.
Travis: Seeker Asum is?
Matt: Yes. That's a charm action to get him out of that. That will be Sylas' turn. That brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: I'm going to go double my speed. My fly speed is 80 feet right now. I'm going to head towards and pick up Scanlan.
Matt: Make a general dexterity check. You're flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle flowing through.
Marisha: Dexterity saving throw, you said? As my eagle form, right? 12?
Matt: 12? Okay, that's fine. You clip a wing. It hurts, and you wince at the impact, but you manage to make your way in there. As you come down, you grab Scanlan, but there's not a lot of room here to get much lift or air, so you're now clutching your gnome.
Sam: Do I get a save?
Matt: Do you not want to be grabbed by her?
Sam: Well, I don't know she's there. I don't know what's grabbing me.
Marisha: You've seen me turn into an eagle.
Sam: I'm not even looking at you.
Matt: Make an insight check.
Sam: Insight check? Okay. Not good. Five.
Matt: Five. Okay, you see this giant eagle come screeching into the room, talons out, and starts coming at you with talons. Be mindful of that. It's technically now a grapple contest, so go ahead and make an athletics check.
Marisha: An athletics check with my eagle. Is that dex or strength?
Matt: It would be strength.
Marisha: 19.
Matt: 19. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check to avoid it, or athletics. Athletics or acrobatics, your choice.
Sam: 15.
Matt: 15. As much as you try and fight, the eagle grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in its claws. Oh, woe is this evening.
Sam: First, I got a small drink, and now this?
Matt: All right, that finishes Keyleth's turn. I need you to make a second death saving throw.
Liam: I succeeded.
Matt: Okay, so you stabilize.
Liam: Wait, I'm at one?
Matt: You didn't die. Sorry. My apologies. Vex, you swing around the corner, just getting to the outskirts.
Laura: Right as I get outside-- I would whistle, but Vex can whistle, and she whistles for Trinket.
Matt: You're not sure where Trinket is.
Laura: No, but I whistle for him. He knows to listen for it.
Matt: Do you want to get as close as possible to the fray?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: I'd say as you turn the corner, that will get you about there, and you can see now, there is Seeker Asum and Lord Briarwood both standing over what looks to be a small cluster of cloth, the source of the dread.
Laura: I scream. Can I attack?
Matt: You can, yeah.
Laura: Okay, if I did something that did five feet-- ten feet... I've got to look at this. Yeah, ten feet. If I hit Lady Briarwood, would that hit my brother, or would that just hit Bastard Briarwood?
Matt: No, that would just hit her. Oh, within ten feet? It would hit Seeker and Sylas, yeah.
Laura: Fuck it, I'm doing it. Lightning Arrow right at her face.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Roll for it.
Sam: Don't miss.
Laura: Well, that's wedged.
Travis: Yeah, it's a weirdo roll.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: The fury pumps through your veins in an attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your twin brother at death's door. You pull the arrow from the back of your quiver. As you feel the energy gather from the atmosphere around you, while the energy itself is a blue crackling energy, you see it as bright, vibrant crimson red. You release it with a scream towards Lady Briarwood. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Laura: What do I do, times two?
Matt: Yes, times two.
Laura: So it was 32 damage on her, and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save.
Matt: All right, he doesn't get one.
Laura: Not him. He's not in it. And I Hunter's Marked her.
Matt: Right, so it does additional damage.
Laura: Fuck. One.
Matt: One. Okay.
Marisha: Every little bit counts.
Matt: The lightning hits her. It shocks her, and you see the pain come through, but for the sheer force that should have been, it seems almost like it wasn't as impactful as it should have been. However, Lord Briarwood and Seeker Asum both fail, so they both take the additional damage.
Laura: Oh, good. Then 2d8 for them. Nine, and then times two because it was critical? 18.
Matt: Sure. I'll allow it.
Liam: Haggling.
Laura: And I get another attack, though. Yes? Okay, then I'm going to attack her through my Blazing Bowstring. Natural 20 again! (cheering)
Laura: Inspired by my brother!
Matt: You've certainly invoked the fury tonight. All right, go ahead.
Liam: She loves me.
Matt: Against Lady Briarwood to follow up on that?
Laura: Yes, of course it is! Okay, eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers, so that's 17 times two is 34.
Sam: Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Plus Hunter's Mark damage, which is another fucking six! 38 damage. No! No, it is 40 damage.
Matt: Well, no, she's not concentrating because he's unconscious. I was saving for the Hold Person spell, but she's not concentrating on that, currently.
Laura: She's on fire!
Matt: She is actually lit on fire.
Laura: I should say what the Blazing Bowstring does, huh? An additional d10 of damage for that. Would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two?
Matt: No.
Laura: Another six for that.
Liam: Does Seeker Asum get a save now that he's been hit, to shake that charm?
Matt: It has to be damage from the allies of the person who charmed them, so no. You guys are currently considered a threat to him. All right, so that ends your turn. That brings us to Delilah. Delilah, who's now on fire. Laura, the Blazing Bowstring, does that ignite her? Does she take continuous fire damage, or is that just one-time fire damage? No, it's an additional 1d10 once. She shrugs off the flames. I remember that. Angrily.
Kit: At least you messed up her dress.
Laura: Yeah, fuck that dress!
Matt: As the electrical energy and the flames dissipate, she puts her hands out like this, and she looks at you for a second and she extends one cruel finger towards you with a look of intense hatred. I need you to make a constitution save.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: I don't know if she has to aim it or not. Let me check. Nope! I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Laura: Okay. Yeah. Okay, cool. 15. No, wait. 17.
Matt: 17. That's not enough, unfortunately.
Sam: Oh man. That's a lot of rolling.
Liam: Carry the three...
Matt: You take 66 points of necrotic damage as a sickly beam of black energy streaks out from her finger, plows into your torso, and you feel as if your soul is temporarily pulled from a portion of your body. For a second there, your eyes glance past the threshold of death, and you manage to pull yourself back in. The cold resonates through the rest of your body, and all of a sudden the temperature outside, which was already pretty chilly, feels freezing cold. Brush with the Finger of Death. All right, she is going to move over towards Sylas right here, getting into a protective standpoint, glancing down at the unconscious body of Vax. That brings us to-- we have Grog, Tiberius, and Scanlan.
Sam: I'm going first. Fucking shit. I know she's got me in her fucking claws.
Matt: You've figured this out now, after this whole (yelps). Keyleth, of course.
Sam: Can I still see through the window?
Matt: You can see through the window right there, yeah. It's hard, at this point.
Sam: Okay, I'll use my bonus action first to cast Healing Word on Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf--
Matt: What's the range on Healing Word?
Marisha: 30 feet.
Matt: He is not close enough to reach. You'll have to move first.
Laura: Then maybe you don't want to go first.
Marisha: I can take you over there.
Sam: Would I know that?
Matt: You would know the range of it. You'd be like, "Ugh, he's too far."
Travis: You can move first, can't you?
Sam: I can't move. She's holding me.
Laura: You can wait.
Marisha: I'm trying to give you a fast way down, motherfucker.
Sam: I know. I guess I'll hold my turn.
Matt: Okay. All right. Tiberius?
Orion: Okay. Move me an additional 30 feet because my flight is 60 feet, so that was from the last turn.
Matt: Okay, 60 feet flying speed. Good to know.
Orion: Let's swoop in that room. Another 60 feet. How far can I go? Can I go all the way down?
Matt: That's as far as you can get, right there.
Orion: Crap, balls. Can I see anything? I can't see anything. Outside?
Matt: That's the 60 feet for your movement.
Orion: I'm still flying, so can I see?
Matt: Right, from an elevated standpoint, you would probably just barely be able to see the edge of Lord Briarwood down there, below. He would have three-quarters cover, but you can see him.
Orion: I can't see Vax?
Matt: No. Not from the angle of the window.
Orion: I charge my decanter. That's my turn.
Matt: Okay. All right. You can use your action to move, if you want to get closer to the window.
Orion: Oh shit. Yeah. Can I do that?
Matt: Or you could go outside, if you wanted to.
Orion: Then I can't do anything else after that, right?
Matt: This would be the end of your turn, regardless.
Orion: Okay, then get me right where I can see Vax.
Matt: Right there?
Orion: Actually, skootch me one over. I can still see him from right there, yeah?
Matt: Yeah, you can see him there. Cool, so you're floating in the air, currently, looking through the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem that's below. That ends Tiberius's turn. Grog.
Travis: Raging, I see Vex take off so fast. I try and catch up to her and see what's freaking her out so much. My speed is 50.
Sam: Wait, no. Healing Word has a 60 feet range. You said 30!
Travis: You're after me. It's okay.
Matt: It's all happening simultaneously.
Travis: I take the Firebrand Warhammer with the Chain of Returning attached to it. I activate it, and I throw it at Lady Delilah.
Matt: Okay. What's the range on it?
Travis: It doesn't have a distance. It has a DC to pull it back.
Matt: Here's what we'll do. It's the warhammer or war pick?
Travis: Yeah, the warhammer, but the Chain of Returning doesn't have a distance.
Matt: I know. It's the distance of the weapon, is what it is.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Looking it up right now for you.
Taliesin: What did we do before iPhones?
Travis: How is it 150/120?
Laura: Yeah, because you used it when we were fighting that manta ray.
Matt: I don't have a Player's Handbook. If somebody could look up the equipment section right now?
Marisha: What are you looking for?
Matt: Excuse the sound change here, as I have to move the mic. There we go. I got it. There is a range on thrown weapons, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Does it count as a mace? Handaxe?
Matt: Warhammer... this one is not considered an actual normally thrown weapon, so I would give it the same distance of a handaxe, which is 60-foot max, but you would be at disadvantage on the throw, anyway. Pretty heavy disadvantage on this, so we'll give it a shot.
Travis: That doesn't even make 60 feet, though, does it?
Matt: No. As you lob--
Travis: If I know how long it is, can I do something else instead of throwing it? If I'd known the distance--
Matt: Yeah, if you know the distance, then I'll say sure.
Travis: Can I try for Intimidating Presence?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: There's a DC saving throw--
Matt: Against her?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. She glances over at you as you come running around the corner, this giant engine of muscle and death. You growl at her, screaming--
Travis: (roars) No!
Matt: What's the DC on it?
Travis: 13.
Matt: 13. She glances over at you and you see her head turn to the side with a curious chuckle.
Travis: So low! God!
Matt: Yeah. Sorry.
Marisha: Bring it back to Sam.
Matt: All right. Kit, you're up. Oh, that's right. You're doing your turn. Continue.
Sam: Will 60 feet hit him?
Matt: Yes, it would.
Sam: Okay, then I will heal Vax. (singing) Oh, that Vax elf, getting bit by vampires, and his skin's turning pale and white. But don't worry, because around the corner, here comes Scanlan. Everything's going to be all right.
Liam: I feel like I'm going insane!
Matt: All right, so roll for how much you heal him.
Sam: Even though that's a bonus action, I'm going to do it as a 5th-level spell.
Matt: It's an additional 1d4 for each, so it would be 5d4 plus five.
Sam: And I roll it?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: Okay. Well, then give me a bunch of d4s.
Matt: Kit, you're on deck, so imagine what you're going to do next.
Sam: I need one more. Great. Okay. Whoa, what the hell is that one? Ah, shit! What are these? I can never add d4.
Orion: 12. Plus?
Matt: Five. So you heal 17 hit points. From the darkness--
Sam: Wait, is it plus five, or is it plus five, five, five--
Matt: No, it's plus five. Consciousness comes to you. Breath comes into your chest, and you can feel the cold, wet grass against the left side of your face. Your vision begins to clarify for a second, and you look up over you. You can see immediately to the right of you both Lord and Lady Briarwood standing over you, looking down with one half of their gaze, the other paying attention to--
Liam: They're looking at me?
Matt: They're looking down at you and glancing at this slowly encroaching circle of assailants. That was your bonus action.
Sam: That was my bonus action. As my action action-- oh man, this is stupid. I lift my Hand Cone of Clarity, and I sing to Lady Delilah, (singing) Hey there, Delilah, won't you listen to me because I'm about to cast a spell on you. Ooh! Oh! (speaking) Okay, so I'm going to use Suggestion on her. This is so stupid!
Matt: So what's the DC on that?
Sam: Well, it's 19.
Matt: With that. Okay, good to know. What are you suggesting to her?
Sam: I'm suggesting that she has an unquenchable urge to make out with her husband.
Matt: All right. And what saving throw is it? Is it a wisdom saving throw?
Sam: It is wisdom.
Matt: Wisdom. Okay, good to know. Rolled an 18. She has advantage on it, anyway. All right. Yeah, she rolled a natural 18, plus her wisdom bonus of two. That puts her at a 20. She just crested over it. You can see, she glances up for a second at you. The presence of the actual shouting and the Suggestion echoing through the glass and out the other broken window. She looks up and you see parts of the shards of the glass are actually shaking from your singing. The harmonic resonance of the glass catching your--
Liam: She doesn't feel even a little bit horny?
Matt: You gather that probably at all given points of time, she probably enjoys being close to her husband, but not overcome with an uncontrollable urge.
Sam: She has a headache.
Matt: Right. All right, so that ends Scanlan. Kit.
Kit: Okay. Am I within 120 feet of either of the Briarwoods?
Matt: You are, but they're not currently in visual range because they're outside and down below, so if you want to try and move over this way, you can try to get a visual.
Kit: Am I able to move somewhere where I can see them?
Matt: You would have to leap up onto the edge of the canopy bed. You can just see them past the broken window, down into the courtyard there, as Tiberius, the dragonborn you saw coast through, is hovering in the air about five feet above you.
Kit: I would like to -- oh, there's lots of excitement going on, isn't there? I would like to use Crown of Madness, if I may.
Sam: Wait! I thought she was just a common guard!
Laura: Servant.
Kit: I would like to use Crown of Madness on Lord Briarwood.
Matt: All righty. What is the DC on the spell?
Kit: My DC would be eight plus my spellcasting modifier--
Matt: It should be at the very top of your spell sheet.
Kit: Okay. 17.
Matt: 17. All right. Against Lord Briarwood... (chuckles) Even with his plus seven--
Laura: Yay!
Taliesin: Oh my god, is something actually going to work?
Matt: He is going to use his legendary resistance to succeed the saving throw. So as you do that, you see the magical energy form around his head and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and begins to clasp around, and he looks up for a second and shrugs his hair like that, and it (crash) dissipates, and you can see for a brief second his vision come up and find your gaze.
Marisha: But Matt, she's our guest!
Matt: I understand! As it was a concentration spell, also, the illusion that you currently were holding fades away. What was once the demure, mousy-looking human guest suddenly appears as a pale, white tiefling, currently now existing at the edge of the bed. Her image shimmers and disappears as you see her standing before you on her hoofed legs, holding what was previously a non-visible staff in one hand.
Orion: And I'm right above her?
Matt: You are right above her, yeah.
Orion: I go, ooh! Nice horns!
Matt: Looking over your shoulder, you're a little bit in front of her, but yeah, you see her. All right, so that will be your turn there.
Laura: Our friend is in mortal danger right now, you maybe wouldn't want to hit on somebody, at that moment.
Kit: I would have to agree.
Matt: Percy. Following suit, you begin to move around the corner to the others. You are now within visual range of both Briarwoods-- at a far distance, though-- too far for the Pepperbox. No, its range is 150, so yeah.
Taliesin: Pepperbox range is 150, but the Bad News range is disgusting.
Matt: Nah, they're within range for both.
Taliesin: So I'll start with Bad News.
Marisha: Nothing travels faster.
Taliesin: (sighs) All right. First shot.
Matt: Against who?
Taliesin: (yelling) Sylas!
Travis: Yes. I got little goosebumps from that.
Taliesin: That's a 30 to hit.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit.
Travis: Rock. His. Shit.
Taliesin: (sighs) This is about to feel so good.
Travis: De-cleat this motherfucker.
Marisha: These are the worst people we've ever faced.
Taliesin: I hate them, I hate them so much. Where's my other d12s?
Marisha: d12s? 12, 12 away.
Taliesin: That's 17 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. The first shot. As you (gunshot), the shot echoing out across the night sky of Emon, Lord Briarwood, who is currently staring down at you as you come to consciousness, and you can see under his breath, he says, "Oh, there's no way out tonight, friend." And begins to lean forward before (impact) the back of his shoulder is wracked by a sudden impact. You see dark material just (spray) spatter out with some sort of dark crimson, and he (grunts). Looks over his shoulder with anger, and you can see at that point, glistening across the moonlight, the sharpened fangs visible at the edge of his mouth. As he looks over--
Taliesin: Is he looking at me? Okay, good, I'm taking another aimed shot at his face.
Matt: Okay, so you use your second attack to reload.
Taliesin: Third shot, aimed shot at the face, while he was turning around.
Liam: As he reloaded, weakly, behind him, I go, hi, Percy.
Taliesin: That's 24 to hit.
Matt: 24 to hit will hit.
Sam: Skadoosh!
Taliesin: (laughs) That's 28 points of damage, and he has disadvantage on all attacks for this round.
Marisha: Yes!
Matt: Okay. That was using the arm shot? Good. So as he turns around and glares at you, there's like a moment of clarity, and you can feel that familiar stare, that horrible glare, and the cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that you've been waiting for this sequence. As you load the weapon, he says it loudly enough for you to hear, but this voice now, you see Lord Briarwood says, "Would you look at that, dear? The pup yet lives." (chuckles, gunshot) (laughter)
Matt: A big chunk of flesh is just blown off and you can see the bone beneath. (grunts, growls)
Kit: No mercy Percy!
Taliesin: Is that as far as I can make it?
Matt: It's as far as you can get. You still have your heroic action, if you wanted to do that. Holding onto it? Okay. All right. So that will end your turn. Seeker is then going to turn this way, step towards the side and pull his crossbow out. It was already loaded with a bolt into it, and he's going to take a shot at Grog, who's currently the biggest target right now. That's going to be-- rolled a two. That's going to be a 13 against armor class.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Yeah. Goes and for the bonus action reloads and gets the second shot at you. That will be a 19.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: All right. You take seven points of piercing damage, halved because of your rage. And with the rest of his movement, Seeker Asum's going to go ahead and step back in the shadow beside there. Ending that turn, now it comes to Lord Briarwood.
Marisha: Wait, I didn't get my turn?
Matt: Keyleth, you're up after him.
Liam: And I have a question. At some point I'm in the mix?
Matt: Yeah, you're coming up. Don't worry. You guys rolled the lowest initiatives.
Orion: Oh, he's prone, still.
Matt: He's still prone, yeah. So Sylas is going to, seeing the circumstance, reach down and attempt to grab you.
Sam: Get out of there.
Matt: He has disadvantage because of that. (laughs) All right, that's going to be a total of 11.
Liam: To do what? To grapple check? Do I have to roll, too?
Matt: To attempt to grapple you, yeah.
Liam: So I roll, as well.
Matt: You don't have to.
Liam: Yeah, fuck that guy.
Matt: Yeah, so it missed entirely. All right, so that's with his first strike. Second one, he's going to go for another attempted grapple on you. With disadvantage, that comes to 18.
Liam: For hitting?
Matt: For hitting you. All right. And now he's going to make an athletics check to attempt to grapple you. That is going to be a 13.
Sam: As I see this going on, can I call out with Cutting Words to distract him?
Matt: You could, yes.
Sam: Okay. (singing) Distraction, distraction! Distraction! Distraction, distraction!
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d10.
Sam: What do I roll?
Matt: d10. And subtract that from his attack modifier.
Sam: Six.
Matt: Okay. With that, as he reaches down in an attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat, the fingers are coming towards you and you try and attempt to roll out of the way. All of sudden, you hear, "Distraction!" and Lord Briarwood's, (annoyed sigh). You see his massive eyeroll and then goes in for the attack, but that's given you enough time to roll out of the way his hand only meets the ground. He's then going to step back and get adjacent to Lady Briarwood. That ends his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to fly out the window with Scanlan.
Matt: Out the broken one over here or the non-broken one?
Marisha: The broken one.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What are you doing to me?
Matt: So you're coasting over here.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and drop him off.
Matt: Okay, so as you swoop down and leave Scanlan right there in front of them, that'll be there.
Marisha: So Seeker Asum, he's against us?
Matt: You have no idea, you just swooped out there and he's there like hiding in the shadow.
Marisha: But he just fired at Grog.
Matt: You didn't see it, though, from your perspective there. You just saw a bolt go.
Marisha: Oh, I didn't see that. Do I still have enough movement to make an action?
Matt: Yeah you do, yes, that was just your movement as you swooped down.
Marisha: Where's Lord Briarwood?
Matt: Right there.
Marisha: I'm going to go and try and peck his eyes out.
Sam: Are you dropping me?
Marisha: Yeah, I dropped you off, I'm going to go and swoop over--
Matt: Okay. You've already used your movement to get there and drop him off and go all the way around.
Marisha: That's what I was asking.
Matt: Yeah, you used your full movement to get there and drop off Scanlan.
Travis: Do you still want to be an eagle?
Liam: Yeah, because it's a hit point sponge.
Marisha: Yeah, you know what, I'll drop eagle form.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, all of a sudden the eagle condenses down and forms back into Keyleth in her half-elven form.
Marisha: And I will also use my bonus action to cast Healing Word on Vax.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I will also cast it at-- actually, I'll cast it at a 3rd level because I want to be safe.
Sam: Here are some d4s.
Marisha: Thank you.
Laura: She cast it at Vax.
Sam: So you need one more, right? At level three?
Marisha: Oh, and it's plus my spell modifier? Is that what it is? Plus ten, so yeah, I need one more, so that's 17 points.
Matt: 17 points of healing.
Orion: Hers is different.
Marisha: Oh no, wait. No, 15. Sorry.
Sam: You're back.
Laura: You're back, baby.
Matt: And with that, Vax.
Liam: You have to tell me what's possible. I'm prone, right?
Matt: You are prone on the ground.
Liam: This is what I'd like to do. You tell me if it's possible. I'd like to click my boots of haste together and then get up, which takes my full movement? What does it take?
Matt: Half your movement.
Liam: Half my movement. This is what I want to do, you tell me if it's possible. Click my boots of haste, get up, use disengage again, and then run like a motherfuck straight towards--
Matt: Yeah, you could probably do that, yeah.
Travis: Do it!
Liam: That's what I want to do.
Sam: Straight towards what?
Liam: My sister. And as I run past, I share a very awkward glance with Keyleth and keep going and just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her.
Matt: Okay, and what's your full movement then? It would be 30 times two, which would be 60, half that, so you can run 30 feet because it takes half your movement to get up. So yeah, you disengage. There you go.
Laura: There you go.
Sam: Well good, I'm glad I'm tip of the spear now. Jesus. (laughs) How did that happen?
Laura: Dimension Door!
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. At the top is Vex.
Laura: All right. I'm going to--
Travis: Kill some people?
Laura: Okay, yeah, I'm going to take a healing potion. A superior, which is what?
Matt: Superior would be 8d4 plus eight.
Laura: That's so many fours.
Travis: It's not like you don't have 30 dice anyway. So many dice.
Marisha: These fuckers, I'm so angry at them.
Laura: 20. Oh, 28. That's good. And then I'm going to cast-- I'm sorry, Hunter's Mark. I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns right at the one in the middle. They're right next to each other, right?
Matt: Yeah. You would be scooting right over Scanlan's head with your arrow.
Laura: Let's stick it to Lady Briarwood again. Cool. Balls. Oh wait, do I, I don't need to roll to hit on that, right?
Matt: It would say on the spell.
Laura: Oh wait, that's wrong. Oh, the next time I hit a creature. Oh, so I don't think I hit her. That was 15.
Matt: 15 would not hit, unfortunately.
Laura: Okay, then I try it again. I didn't hit her again! It's because you're safe now, buddy.
Matt: So as she stands there grinning, looking over all this, they're both amused by this whole circumstance, there isn't really a glimmer of fear. As the first arrow comes by, she leans to the side, just dodges it a little bit. The second one comes towards her, and Lord Briarwood deflects it out from in front of her and gives you a look of like, don't you dare touch my woman.
Laura: Where's Trinket?
Matt: Trinket is somewhere.
Laura: Okay, did he hear? I whistle again.
Matt: You whistle again, okay. That's your turn.
Matt: All right, so. With that, you see the dragonborn comes flying up through the window, and Delilah looks back at everyone and sees everyone rushing forward and says, "Honey, we'll deal with them. Worse comes to worst." And she glances up at you. "But you."
Orion: I'm Tiberius Stormwind!
Matt: "Yes, indeed you are." As she looks at you for a second, and there's this sparkle, this prismatic glow of light in her eyes. I need you--
Orion: 4th-level Counterspell. Were you saying something?
Matt: Hold on.
Marisha: Hold on. (laughs) I think distance makes a difference with these people.
Matt: All right, so you're going to attempt to counter. Let's do this.
Sam: Dice versus dice. Wizard versus wizard.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d20, add five.
Orion: Seven.
Matt: Yeah, that's not going to do it.
Liam: But that's a lucky number.
Matt: At that point, all of a sudden, you feel a surge of arcane energy suddenly burst, not visually, but on this coursing connection, almost like two nexus points of energy. There's this tidal wave of arcane energy that blasts into your mind. I need you to go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw.
Liam: Are they Superman and Wonder Woman? What the heck?
Laura: Yeah.
Orion: 18.
Matt: 18? 18 would unfortunately not succeed. Yeah, you take 21 points of psychic damage--
Orion: (yelps)
Matt: And your intelligence and charisma scores become one.
Sam: What?
Matt: Suddenly, language leaves you. All the spells, the nature of spellcasting, is robbed, and you know where you are, but everything is instinctual. From this point, you are essentially, from a communication standpoint, a giant lizard.
Orion: (lizard noises) Am I still flying? I'm assuming I fall.
Matt: At this point, actually, yeah, you do, because you can only maintain concentration. And you land on the ground. She then steps--
Orion: Wait! Is it permanent?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: I can fix it. It's okay; don't worry about it right now. I can't fix it right now!
Matt: Tiberius. It's your turn.
Orion: What the fuck can I do? Is there a saving throw?
Sam: There is no save.
Matt: At the end of every 30 days.
Sam: 30 days?! He doesn't even know what a day is!
Marisha: I can fix it. I can fix it after I sleep. Just not right now!
Matt: Which is what she would be saying if she was knowing this was happening to you. So anyway. You still know your friends. You know you have friends here. You know there's something to protect. You know that people need protection. You must protect! And that's the extent of where your drive is right now.
Orion: Well, I guess-- and I'm confused as hell, I assume?
Matt: It's hard to say. You're still you, you're still present there, you just know that suddenly, "Spells? I don't know spells. (growls) Anger. Frustration. Protect." It's all base instincts right now.
Travis: Does he know friend from foe?
Matt: You don't know.
Orion: I mean, I'm not going to do shit. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to leave. I'm going to go out the door and back in the hallway. And I'm going to whip around to that guy and go, (aggressive lizard noises).
Matt: And he goes, (scared noises).
Orion: Because I know I don't like him.
Matt: Right. And takes another five foot step back from you. Unexpected feral reaction from Tiberius!
Orion: And I'm going to dash.
Matt: Yeah, I moved you double. Okay, that ends your turn? Grog?
Travis: Me? I would like to run towards the fucking Lord Sylas. Can I reach him?
Matt: You can't get all the way there, but you can get within throwing range.
Travis: Throwing range only? Yeah, I'm going to throw the hammer again.
Matt: All right, so now you (whoosh) lob it, the flames arcing in a circle towards him.
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17, all right. So (smash) the hammer hits him in the front, the flames burst from the impact, you can hear the metal clang of metal against the armor he's wearing under his outfit.
Travis: Oh, yeah, sorry, d6 of flame damage! Shit. One.
Matt: All right. You did 18 damage, then, good to know. All right, so go ahead, and if you want to try and retract, it's a bonus action.
Travis: I succeed.
Matt: You pull in the chain. It whips back. Like Thor, you catch it mid-air, prepare yourself for the next round. That'll be your turn. Scanlan?
Sam: Oh. Hi.
Matt: You're now there, face to face. You are essentially the shield of the group between the Briarwoods.
Sam: Oh. Hello. What a lovely dinner we had-- Lightning! (laughter)
Matt: All right. You go to release the spell. She immediately begins to mutter something in between. You immediately feel this counteractive arcane energy. If she hadn't rolled a natural one on her Counterspell, that would've been pretty bad. But through the sheer force of frustration and anger at this point now, the lightning bolt presses through her counter, and the bolt is released in that direction, arcing towards both of them.
Sam: Wait, she rolled a one?
Matt: She rolled a one to try and counter your spell.
Liam: Please make it funny.
Sam: Oh, so wait, I get to roll for damage now? It's a bunch of d6s right? 8d6.
Matt: 8d6. And for their saving throws--
Sam: Can I arc it so it hits both of them?
Matt: Yeah, it would hit them both.
Sam: Would it also hit Mr. Awesome?
Matt: No, he's off to the left.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: All right. So they do both make their saving throw, so they both take half damage.
Laura: Of course they do. Hate them!
Sam: 32?
Matt: 32, okay. That's a 16 to Sylas and eight to Lady Delilah.
Sam: Wow, she can take half of half?
Matt: Apparently.
Laura: Magic resistance.
Matt: Both of them (impact sounds) take the blast from the-- and you see this look of: okay, things are getting a little weird now. They both look at each other with a realizing they're now a front of two against many swarming individuals. Do you want to move or stay where you are?
Sam: I will move backwards. By a lot. And have I seen the tiefling?
Matt: You have not. Oh no, you did. You flew past as you went and you were like: what the heck is that? And then you pulled out.
Sam: But I don't have eyes on her? So I can't inspire her?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Sam: All right, well then, I will inspire Keyleth. (singing) Can you feel the blood tonight? That's it, that's all I got. (laughs) All right. So you're inspired.
Marisha: Thanks. I get a d10 right? Ha! Okay.
Matt: All right, so that ends your turn. That brings us to you.
Kit: Okay, I'm starting to get a bit pissed now. My tail is whipping, and I would like to use Phantasmal Killer.
Marisha: What is that?!
Kit: To Lord Briarwood. Again.
Marisha: That sounds awesome.
Sam: Her accent is so fake.
Kit: (exaggerated American accent) I know, right?
Matt: So are you staying at the edge of the bed, or are you going towards the window to have a clear view?
Kit: I'll move forward a bit.
Matt: All right, so you leap off the side of the bed, come up to the edge of the broken window, looking down towards it. All right! Let's try and make this wisdom saving throw. Chose to make his save, using his legendary resistance.
Laura: Wait, how many times does he get that damn thing?
Travis: He's like a dragon!
Kit: It's fine, I'll wear him out.
Matt: Remember, the target still becomes frightened for the duration. So now, as you do this and look up, Lord Briarwood has had this cocky grin the whole time, sees this sudden albino tiefling in the window glare down and send this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from above. The echo of the hiss hits Lord Briarwood and for the first time, you see him recoil in strange momentary terror and seems to almost step back into the side of his wife. Glances over his shoulder towards her and she gives him a look of misunderstanding and acknowledgement. So he cannot get near you, currently. Cannot get any closer to you and has disadvantage against anything against you.
Travis: Just her or us?
Matt: Just her.
Travis: Clap hands.
Matt: All right. Very cool. So that's your turn on that one. Percy.
Marisha: Percy!
Taliesin: I'm going to take a standard walking speed 30 feet straight ahead. Swinging Bad News back onto my back, pulling out Pepperbox. Sylas! I'm getting his attention again. I'm going to start shooting with--
Sam: Are you still in disguise?
Taliesin: No, I don't think anymore.
Matt: No, the moment you fired, the illusion dissipated.
Taliesin: Yeah. So I'm going to be using my sharpshooter for this.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's 26 to hit.
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Taliesin: So that's, let's see. Oh, I need one of these, too. That's 22 points of damage and one point of fire damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Same thing again.
Matt: So you've shot, reload, shot. And this turn--
Taliesin: No, I put Bad News away. Bad News is empty.
Matt: Oh, so Bad News is empty. That's the first shot. You got this. Cool. Sorry, I misunderstood.
Taliesin: Ain't going to be a dick about it.
Matt: All right, so this is the first shot. Second shot.
Taliesin: 25?
Matt: 25 hits.
Taliesin: That's 21 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Shooting again.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18 does not hit. The first shot (impact) off the shoulder and the second one (impact) hits the same point where Bad News hit the arm, blasting off another portion of the flesh. And the third one, this time, you can actually see the shadows coalesce around him and the shot just misses through the darkness and reforms into the physical form of Sylas. As you're finishing your turn, that, you can see, Sylas' flesh is reforming and healing rapidly from the damage he's taken. The actual tendons are forming back up from the blast damage. He's looking at you with a slight grin but then nervously back at the tiefling in the window. Back and forth. At this point in time, Asum is going to go ahead and back up this way and is going to use an action to hide. Rolls a three. Terrible. Absolutely useless. All right, so Sylas now is going to angrily look around and pulls off from the back, you can see this shimmer as there was an illusion dissipates and what previously looked like it was an empty back, a large scabbard appears. Pulling this giant dark, slate-gray greatsword from the back and lunges forward towards you, Grog.
Marisha: Sylas?
Laura: Did someone ever get Uriel?
Matt: You have not seen Uriel, no. All right. Is going to then make a strike at you. That's a 26 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: All right. You take 12 points of slashing damage. Reduced to six. And I need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Do I have advantage on those if I'm raging?
Matt: No, you just have a high constitution.
Sam: He still has disadvantage on attacks, right? That wore off?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18, all right. You feel like the actual wound from the blade is attempting to draw some force from your body, but you just (grunts) and flex and whatever arcane enchantment is resisted. Turns around for a second swipe, that is going to be a 19.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: Hits? All right. You take 15 points of slashing damage. Half that to seven, or be eight. Round up for use. So eight. And make another constitution saving throw.
Travis: Damn it. Ha! Even better. 21.
Matt: Yeah, once again. There's some sort of enchantment that's trying to pull from the wounds as it hits you and you just grin them off with this chuckle. So he's going to use the rest of his movement to step back a little bit. You get an attack of opportunity.
Travis: I do?
Matt: Yes, you do. With the hammer.
Travis: Yes! That's 24.
Matt: 24 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: Awesome. That's 11, plus four points of fire damage, so 15.
Matt: Okay, 15. Cool. That ends his turn. Keyleth.
Marisha: My turn? Okay. Wait, where did Briarwood go? Lord Briarwood.
Taliesin: Right there.
Matt: Right there.
Marisha: Oh, he backed up. Beautiful. So I take my staff and I crack it on the ground. Where I cracked it, little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and I'm going to cast Sleet Storm. I need a thing.
Sam: I have a 20. What do you want?
Marisha: No I need a--
Sam: What do you need?
Marisha: A laser pointer! There you go. So it's a 40-foot radius. Starting where Briarwood is.
Matt: All righty. A 40-foot radius.
Marisha: Right. Starting in this line. Grog's not in it.
Matt: This way, you mean?
Marisha: From here back.
Matt: So Sleet Storm (boom) right in that area right there. So as you slam the ground, the ice begins to move around and all of a sudden the cold air begins to form this almost like mist as the temperature shift suddenly impacts the surrounding vicinity. The grass freezes in place, and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to rain down in the vicinity.
Marisha: So the ground in the area is difficult terrain. It is covered with slick ice. When a creature enters the spell's area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there, it must make a dexterity saving throw or else it's knocked prone, because they slip and fall. If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw against your spell's DC or lose concentration.
Matt: Good to know.
Sam: And you have inspiration.
Matt: Cool. All righty. So?
Marisha: And then I move back.
Matt: That ends your turn. Vax.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to throw one dagger at Briarwood's face.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Liam: That's a one. If I'm hasted, can I do two potions? Instead of attack, attack, attack.
Matt: No. The additional action is not so much a potion.
Liam: All right, so I'm taking a potion of greater healing and walking backward. Walking distance. And greater healing is 4d4, right?
Matt: Greater healing is 4d4 plus four, yeah. All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Yes. Knowing that they seem to be vampires because they've fucking creepy teeth, I'm going to pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at-- Lord Briarwood's in the way of Lady Briarwood now, isn't he?
Matt: You can try and shoot either if you want to move over to the side and get a better view.
Laura: Well I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on him.
Matt: On him? Okay.
Laura: And then I'm going to shoot my holy arrow through my Blazing Bowstring one more time.
Matt: Okay go for it.
Laura: Come on! Hold on! 28.
Matt: 28 does hit.
Laura: Okay, good. Do I do any additional damage with my holy arrow?
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage for the arrow. And you do an additional 2d6 radiant damage to Lord Briarwood.
Laura: Oh wait. 15, 19. Plus ten for the Blazing Bowstring, so 22, and then what did you say?
Matt: 2d6 radiant damage.
Laura: Seven more, so 29 damage.
Matt: Okay, good to know. So as the arrow impacts, (impact sound) he puts up his cloak to guard in time, as it goes (whooshing) through the cloak, you hear this (grunts) in pain as the arrow bursts, and as the cloak comes back, you can see this burning sensation across the front of Lord Briarwood. Where the flesh was healing and sewing itself up, that has been halted immediately by the impact of the holy water, which is beginning to pockmark and burn his flesh.
Laura: Awesome. Then I'm going to hit him again! (laughs) So yes, I'm going to do the same thing! Except I'm out of my Blazing Bowstring; it fizzled out.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Okay that's a 29 to hit.
Matt: That'll hit.
Laura: Okay. That's good. Plus two radiant damage.
Matt: That's your second holy arrow, right?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: What was it before that?
Laura: 17. 28. And then another d6 for my Hunter's Mark. 32!
Matt: Nice. Second one (impact) shatters and you can see now, like part of the jaw is hurt and wounded. (panting) There's this wild frenzy to his face as you can see Lord Briarwood is starting to look a little ragged. All right. That ends your turn.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Lady Delilah Briarwood steps forward up to the back of her husband.
Marisha: She's got to make a dex throw.
Matt: She does. And against the spell, 'cause it's magic, she gets advantage. That would be an 18. What's the DC?
Marisha: It just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or they're knocked prone.
Matt: Right, but it's against your DC of your spell.
Marisha: Oh, is it? 18.
Matt: So yeah, she makes it. So she steps forward; almost slips, but catches herself on the shoulder of her husband and says, "My dear, I fear it's time that we make our leave."
Sam: Make our leave?
Marisha: No, they're going to bamf!
Matt: Casts Dimension Door. Both of them (whoosh) out of visible range.
Sam: Wait! I turn to Vex. Vex, does your Hunter's Mark tell you where they went? They just disappeared. Where'd they go?
Laura: They fucking disappeared?
Taliesin: They Dimension Doored out.
Marisha: They Dimension Doored out.
Laura: I do have Hunter's Mark on him.
Matt: On him, yes. You sense that they're not that far from you. They're around the corner where you guys came from.
Laura: They're right there! Do we want to keep fighting them?
Liam: He's ragged! Go! If we're ever going to get them, we need to get them now! Lead the way, Percival!
Laura: They're around the corner.
Marisha: I can probably teleport us through a tree, right?
Sam: That's okay, we'll just run.
Laura: They're right there.
Matt: As you guys rush around the corner you can see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway, the carriage that they came in is now gaining speed--
Taliesin: Sharpshoot right now. I'm going to try and take out a wheel.
Travis: (yelling) Close the gates!
Taliesin: 27.
Matt: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Nice.
Taliesin: 20 points of damage.
Matt: 20 points of damage, all right. The wheel splinters and (grinding sound) is now coasting on the ground. The young gentleman who is currently on the top is looking over his shoulder, trying desperately to usher them away.
Marisha: How, roughly, far away are they?
Matt: Right now, they're about a hundred feet--
Laura: Is Trinket anywhere near them?
Matt: Trinket was over at the stables on the far back of the palace, unfortunately.
Marisha: I still have my Sleet Storm up. It's a concentration spell. I'm going to move it over there.
Matt: Can you just shift it over there?
Marisha: Yeah. It's a concentration spell. It lasts a minute.
Matt: Oh well no, it's concentration to keep it in the area.
Marisha: Well, then I cast it again.
Matt: So you're casting Sleet Storm again. What's the range on it?
Marisha: 150 feet.
Matt: 150 feet. The sleet storm lands down. The cobblestone becomes sleek; the carriage begins rocking back and forth. However, it does manage to keep on its course, currently; it does not get knocked prone. It's hard to knock a carriage prone, but it is sliding out of the way.
Taliesin: Is that a disadvantage because it only has three wheels?
Matt: Good call, actually.
Marisha: And it's rough terrain?
Matt: That is a two. (cheering)
Matt: At this point, the carriage (crash) slams onto the side of the ground and skids (creaking) to a halt in the middle of the ice, the sleet still spackling down as you guys all turn the corner now; as you approach. The gates have closed (slamming) as the guards have slammed it, listening to Grog on the far side. The door pops open on the side of the carriage. Tiberius, as you've made your way back around and you're at the front now, (panting) and you can see now, about 60 feet in front of you the carriage is overturned in the middle of this sleet storm, on the ground.
Orion: Where is it?
Matt: From a visual standpoint, you're about 60 to 70 feet from the front of this. The doors slam open and you can see Lord and Lady Briarwood step out.
Laura: Can I shoot my exploding arrow?
Matt: Hold on. As you've guys are just turning the corner. You can see now Lord Briarwood stands up and is trying to compose himself, ruffles himself up angrily, looking at his damaged circumstance. Lady Briarwood's against his shoulder and she goes, (clicks tongue) "Well, (sighs) at the very least, I think you should come visit us sometime, Percy. You're always welcome back home. It'd be nice of you to visit your family once in a while." Roll initiative. Just you. As you were the first action to take.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19? Go ahead and roll. Roll the attack for the exploding arrow. This is against Lady Briarwood?
Laura: 29. It's against her.
Matt: Yeah, 29'll hit.
Laura: What do I do damage for the exploding arrow? That Percy made, by the way.
Matt: Yeah. Roll for your--
Laura: 16.
Matt: So 16 regular arrow damage? Okay, against Lady Briarwood. Cool. All right, and then for the additional blast that blows up it's additional 4d6 blast damage to her and they both get saving throws to try and halve it.
Laura: Okay I'm rolling one of our Critical Role dice.
Matt: So half damage to both of them.
Sam: Trademark!
Laura: Damn it.
Sam: Critical fail!
Laura: 11.
Matt: 11? So half that, six damage to each. She needs to make a concentration check. Advantage on that for war caster. Yeah, that's a 19. Okay. So (explosion), a portion of the outside of the carriage just blows apart. Wood shrapnel goes flying to each other side. As the smoke settles and the explosion, you can see, both Lord and Lady Briarwood are still standing there, seemingly unscathed by the event. She wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear, "It's all right." And they both (whoosh) vanish in a swirl of arcane energy. You don't recognize it because right now you don't have the intelligence to really--
Taliesin: I want to walk over to the carriage driver.
Matt: You walk over to the carriage driver, who is currently on the ground, this young man who's horribly hurt, part of his torso is burned, and he's like, (coughs, grunts). Trying to climb away. (gasping) "Please, please spare my life, please. What do you want from me?" (labored breathing)
Taliesin: What do you know?
Matt: "About what?"
Taliesin: I shoot him in the right hand.
Matt: (gunshot, screams) It's an easy enough hit, he's prone before you. Three of his fingers are blown off, and the bloody stumps. (gasps, grunts) Shaking. (panting) "I'm sorry. I don't-- look-- "
Taliesin: You're from Whitestone, yes?
Matt: "I am. You don't know what it's like. I had no choice."
Taliesin: Well, you do now. I reload again and put it on his left hand.
Matt: "Please don't, please." The rest of you are gathered, and you step out from the edge of the window and make your way with the rest of the crowd, and they're watching this display on the front of the palace.
Taliesin: Frederick de Rolo.
Matt: "Yes?"
Taliesin: Where is he?
Matt: "He's gone. He's gone, sir. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: Lady Johanna.
Matt: "They're all gone. Sir, they all--"
Taliesin: Julius de Rolo.
Matt: "I don't know."
Taliesin: Vesper de Rolo.
Matt: "I don't--"
Taliesin: Whitney de Rolo. Ludwig de Rolo. Oliver de Rolo.
Matt: "Your family is gone, sir. They were taken. They were killed. I'm sorry."
Taliesin: You will tell us everything you've seen.
Matt: "They'll find me, sir. They'll kill me."
Taliesin: No, they won't. Because I will kill you first. Tell me what you've seen.
Matt: And with that we're going to go to break. (yelling)
Liam: Wow.
Laura: You're not dead!
Kit: Yay!
Taliesin: Thank you for not dying!
Laura: Hopefully, you won't turn into a vampire. You did get bit.
Orion: I think that works, is like, if it goes all the way down to zero-- [break]
Matt: Welcome back, guys. Couple of quick things before we jump into this. One, we are 38 subs from our next giveaway. Giveaway is for those who are active in chat, get a signed photo of the cast of Critical Role, as well as a signed piece of art, wonderful piece of art from our Kit Buss who's right here with us.
Marisha: Have you guys seen them? They're awesome.
Matt: It's pretty awesome, it's a wonderful piece of art of Keyleth transforming into an earth elemental and attacking K'Varn in the K'Varn fight. So yeah, we have that coming up. Also we have the winner of our shirt giveaway tonight. The winner is one Blair Beverage! (cheering)
Matt: Free shirt. We'll get this to you, so congratulations and thanks for watching tonight.
Liam: Real talk, the winner here tonight is me.
Matt: I was so scared.
Taliesin: You win another day.
Marisha: It's been one of the most emotional nights of my life.
Matt: So. As you all begin to gather around on the front of the courtyard of the palace, you can see some of the guards start rushing out amongst the splinters of this carriage that has been royally destroyed by many of you.
Orion: Do I see that everybody's safe?
Matt: Yeah, you get the sense that there is no immediate danger.
Orion: Okay. I'm going to use my lizard-brain and sniff out immediately Allura, and I'm going to go find her.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Do we see him go find her?
Matt: You guys currently are too engrossed with Percy currently pinning a young boy on the ground and shooting his hand off.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: He's currently like, "Please. What do you need? Just let me go. Please."
Taliesin: I want you to spend the rest of your life making up for the things you've allowed to happen. I now take the butt of my gun and I'm going to knock him unconscious.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I don't quite know. I'm just rolling, but I'd normally get 21.
Matt: 21, at the point of life he has left (whack). Yeah, he just (impact) falls and crumples to the ground unconscious, pool of blood forming.
Taliesin: Are there soldiers coming?
Matt: There are guards coming now from the palace.
Taliesin: Put him in a cell.
Marisha: Wait, we can put him in our cell.
Laura: Yeah, put him in our cell.
Marisha: We'll bring him to Greyskull Keep.
Laura: But make sure he doesn't bleed out first.
Marisha: He's fine. He's not bleeding. It was non-lethal damage, right; he's not bleeding out.
Matt: Well, not from the head but he is missing three fingers from one hand and is currently pooling.
Marisha: All right, I'll solder up his wounds a bit, make sure he doesn't die.
Matt: Okay, so taking care of that. He's unconscious. You guys all take a moment to breathe in and realize the danger that just transpired. The Briarwoods got away. God knows where they're off to. You gather somewhere back in their territory, on their own turf. And you all look about at the guards gathering, making questions, and there are now two guards very intensely harrying this tiefling that showed up out of nowhere and began aiding the battle. You see now, one guard has an arm going to your shoulder and says, "You, what's your name? What's your business here? You do not have approval to be here at the palace."
Kit: I have been working here for months. You did not notice?
Matt: "I think we would notice a tiefling in our midst. You're under arrest. Throw her in the cell."
Liam: I walk forward and slap my hand on the guard's arm and say, we saved Uriel, you will stand down now. Uriel would not be alive if not for the people around you now. She's fine. Walk away.
Matt: The guard gives you a look and says, "As far as we know right now, you both, all of you, attacked two of our guests in the center of our own palace. They managed to flee. We're going to investigate this. Currently we're holding no one at immediate prison sentence for this, but--"
Liam: You realize your lord would not be alive now were it not for us, don't you?
Marisha: Also, you're a common guard. I'm speaking because Tiberius would say this, and he's not here right now because he's a little stupid at the moment, but do not interfere with the businesses that we have already arranged with people who have higher authority than you. Back off.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Marisha: Oh, I'm not good at this shit. I'm going to train in it. It's coming.
Matt: You do get a d6 inspiration dice.
Marisha: I also still have Scanlan's.
Matt: Well, if you already have Scanlan's, then that's all you need.
Travis: And I walk over and stand behind her.
Marisha: I'm going to add my Scanlan. 15.
Matt: All right. The guard looks at you for a second, then steps away. "I mean no offense, understand we've had--"
Laura: What's up? What's good?
Matt: He relinquishes the hand on the side of the tiefling and says, "We're going to investigate this. I mean no disrespect to you. You've been much aid to Emon. Just understand, this is a very peculiar circumstance. Please, we'll call you when it's time to get your opinions and your perspectives on the evening's events."
Marisha: No, we'll call you.
Matt: "We need to go ahead and notify--" at this point you can see now, Tiberius, you've stepped up in front of the stairs as Allura comes rushing out to inspect everything and sees you.
Orion: (groaning, fumbling) And I go to Lockheed, and I use my telepathic bond that I have with my pet. And I convey to him, to tell her, I emote to him, with my telepathic link with him, and I (foreign words).
Matt: You can't even form language thoughts.
Orion: That's what I emote to him.
Matt: You can give him an emotion. That's the most you can get to him right now
Orion: Right, and I try to have him telepathically tell her.
Matt: Tell her what emotion?
Orion: Help.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: I do this.
Matt: She steps forward and says, "Tiberius--"
Marisha: The universal symbol for I'm choking.
Orion: (frustrated noises)
Matt: And you just breathe flame out and Allura steps back for a second, "Tiberius, are you all right? You've been cursed by something. Hold on." She takes your head and holds you in place to calm you down. "Tiberius, calm yourself." And begins to inspect you, running her fingers up the side of your snout and like, "This is not good, this is very powerful magic. I don't know if I have capability of doing this really, you need a cleric. Please, sit tight, stay right here." The rest of you, as the guards back away, you're left alone and the rest of the group are looking upon you in a curious way.
Laura: Vampires!
Sam: And a tiefling.
Taliesin: I want to inspect the carriage to see if there's anything interesting about the carriage.
Laura: Are you hurt? Did they do anything to you? You were unconscious.
Liam: They bit me.
Laura: I search him and look for any mark.
Liam: I don't feel right. I think I need to go to a temple.
Marisha: Can I do a health check on him?
Matt: You can make a medicine check, sure. Percy, go ahead and roll an investigation check
Liam: I think I'm dangerous.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: Okay, yeah, there are definitely two puncture wounds on the side of his neck
Liam: You need to put me in the dungeon very soon.
Sam: I've read about this. We bury him under the ground for five days and five nights, all will be better.
Orion: That's kimchi.
Sam: Well, it could be. Could be kimchi. Either way, it will be very tasty.
Taliesin: Eight.
Matt: Most everything that would be of interest has been destroyed in the sheer force of the explosion. The carriage is in tatters. There's not much you can really glean from it, unfortunately.
Marisha: What time of day is it?
Matt: Time of night. Right now, it's probably cresting close to 10:00 or 11:00PM.
Marisha: Would the Sarenrae temple still be open? It's a church. They're 24 hours, right?
Matt: I mean, (laughs) the temple is always there, per se. I mean, there are multiple temples in the city as well. The Sarenrae temple is the one you know best.
Laura: I turn and look. You.
Sam: What's your name?
Laura: You helped us.
Sam: Your real name.
Kit: You have interesting taste in enemies, almost as interesting as mine. My name is Lillith.
Marisha: Lillith? That's so pretty.
Kit: Thank you, as are you also, might I add.
Laura: Interesting taste in enemies. Do you know anything about vampires?
Kit: Regrettably, not as much as I would like. But your brother? He does look, not as healthy as I imagine he may usually.
Sam: Are you a healer of some sort?
Kit: I am not.
Travis: Oh, what do you deal in?
Sam: And why did you infiltrate the castle? That's how the British people say it
Kit: Oh, really? Well.
Sam: Aluminium.
Laura: Laboratory.
Orion: Astronaut.
Marisha: Let's just keep listing words, guys.
Kit: Lift.
Marisha: Lift!
Kit: I think you have currently more pressing matters than my concerns, my presence here in the castle.
Laura: Then you'll come with us?
Kit: If that is what you wish.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: Where are you from? Your accent's so--
Laura: It's wonderfully interesting Keyleth, but we need to get my brother to a cleric.
Marisha: Oh, right, yeah.
Matt: At this point, as you guys are discussing, and you're already nervous that you're out in the open anyway. You're not under one of your various guises. You feel this warm bolt of heat in your upper torso area. And you guys watch as suddenly across the front of her chest, this strange, glowing, red eye-like sigil (flame noises) emblazons across the front and then slowly fades.
Sam: I am just looking at the symbol, I am not looking at anything else.
Laura: What was that?
Marisha: Are you all right? Are you with the Briarwoods?
Kit: No, but I must leave. I must leave this place right now. Immediately. I drop a shroud of illusion over myself again, become the maidservant.
Matt: You guys watch her visual image shimmer back into that of a servant. And even through the illusion there is still this dull, pulsating red, glowing arcane mark of an eye, that's slowly shimmering on the front of her torso.
Laura: Can you come with us to a temple?
Kit: For not long. I cannot linger.
Sam: What is that mark on you?
Kit: This is the mark of the Broker.
Sam: The Broker?
Kit: The Broker. He has been seeking me and I have been hiding here, but no longer. He has found me. This mark, it means that I cannot hide any longer. I must leave.
Sam: You helped us in battle. Do you need us to help hide you?
Kit: I would not drag you into my troubles. I know who you are, you are Vox Machina.
Laura: How did you know about us?
Kit: Some of you traveled with my cousin Zahra. (gasps)
Laura: Oh my gosh, Zahra! She's so wonderful. I love her so much!
Kit: We are very close. She is a dear friend of mine, but she told me of you. I know you have your own troubles. I would not drag you into mine.
Marisha: Well look, we've got to make a pit stop at the temple of Sarenrae, anyway. Why don't you at least join us, and then we can at least go back to Greyskull keep for dinner, because we also have to drag this prisoner back there. It's along the way.
Laura: Yes. Any watcher that comes after you we'll fight them. We're very strong right now and full of health.
Travis: And we protect things with tails.
Matt: A voice rings out suddenly from behind you towards the palace. "All of you, stop your business." And you look and you see there in his robes, Uriel, which you summoned, standing at the front of the palace. "Am I to understand there has been a scuffle with my guests?"
Laura: Your guests are vampires. Look at my brother right now.
Marisha: And Tiberius is--
Sam: An idiot.
Marisha: He's an idiot. I don't know where he's an idiot right now. Damn it, we lost Tiberius.
Sam: He's even more of an idiot.
Liam: (calling out) Tiberius!
Matt: You see now on the front steps sitting there next to Allura, who's cradling him, as he's unsure of what is happening.
Liam: Oh, do we see them?
Matt: You do, yes.
Laura: Look at his neck.
Matt: Uriel looks and says, "I'm certain there is some sort of explanation for this."
Laura: You invited vampires into your palace.
Marisha: You invited them in.
Matt: "We will investigate. Look, the Briarwoods are esteemed guests of ours, and friends. So this is going to be taken very seriously."
Liam: You can have whatever mages you want cast truth on me. I was bitten. This threat is real.
Taliesin: The Briarwoods murdered the de Rolos and took Whitestone. I have proof. I was there.
Matt: "Then we shall have to have a conversation. For the time being, take care of this one. Tomorrow, when the sun rises, find yourself back to the palace. I would very much like to speak with you. This disturbs me."
Taliesin: I would recommend, Uriel, dis-inviting them for now.
Liam: We have earned your trust, have we not?
Matt: "You have. As have they."
Kit: If I may, my lord. I was present for-- please excuse me addressing your grace, but I was present for the battle, and I did see, oh! Quite a set of teeth he had. Oh, dreadful pale. And oh, terrible. Oh, flames everywhere and ripped dresses and heaving bosoms. Oh my lord! It was awful!
Matt: "All right." Go ahead and make a persuasion roll.
Sam: She's a common servant girl. She wouldn't lie!
Marisha: Yes. Look, she is traumatized.
Kit: 18?
Matt: "Very well, calm yourself, calm yourself."
Laura: It's all right darling. It's all right.
Kit: Oh! It were awful!
Sam: We'll take care of her for now.
Kit: Oh, I'm getting the vapors! Oh no.
Matt: "Take care of her. We'll talk tomorrow. Bring me what proof you have. This is a very, very serious thing you're discussing."
Marisha: We'll talk to him in the morning. We got to go.
Matt: You guys gather up--
Marisha: I turn into a horse and pick up Vax and Vex and take them to Sarenrae's temple.
Matt: Okay, you guys leap onto the back of Keyleth as she rides off.
Laura: I hold onto your mighty mane, and then him as well.
Matt: Allura takes Tiberius, takes you by the elbow, and leads you over the rest of the group as they ride off. "If you are, indeed, going to a cleric, perhaps you should take Tiberius with you. He's not well."
Sam: He seems totally normal to me. Seems like every day. Yep, that's pretty much basic him.
Travis: Is Seeker Asum still around?
Matt: Seeker Asum currently is nowhere near this situation.
Orion: I lick all of Vox Machina.
Matt: All that are present, because many are now riding away on a horse. (laughs) But the rest of them get a fine licking.
Travis: Oh jeez, no!
Orion: I lick Grog the most.
Travis: Smells like flies.
Matt: You all manage to make you way up to the temple of Sarenrae. The lantern light of the interior of the temple's main structure is low, as it is late in the evening. Nevertheless, the gates are always open. And as you enter, you are greeted by two clerics that are dressed in long, flowing yellow and gold robes, and there is one elderly cleric that you recall. The one that led the resurrection ritual on Pike. Not but almost a year ago actually.
Laura: I hop down off of Keyleth. (laughter)
Laura: I take you down, as well. And I say, please, please sir, I hope we're not disturbing you, but we need your help again.
Liam: I totally eat it and just hit the ground.
Travis: That wasn't my fault.
Matt: The two younger clerics step away as the older one steps forward. He's balding on top, this long straggly white gray hair that crests--
Orion: I go up to him and start sniffing him. (sniffing noises)
Marisha: He used to be a very intelligent sorcerer. This is part of the problem.
Matt: "There does appear to be arcane residue on this one. Yes, we could hope to cleanse him of this. Come, enter. Light the lanterns." And the clerics all start turning up various lanterns, and the magical light source of it as soon as you enter the temple. A cold ripple sensation begins to curl on the back of your neck as you step in. As you do step in, too, the two clerics give you a look, and are uncomfortable with the presence. And as it has, you guys, through your travels, you have encountered very few tieflings, let alone on this continent. In fact, most you have met were in Vasselheim. This one in Emon stands out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be just a little put off by her presence.
Laura: I thought she was disguised.
Matt: That's right. Never mind, I retract that entire sequence.
Kit: He's still looking nervous.
Matt: As she comes out of this feverish daydream, none of that happened. (laughter)
Liam: I'm so glad that didn't happen.
Matt: Illusions. All right, so. As you guys enter the center of the chamber. He begins burning various incenses. As you step up, the cleric says, "Understand, these services are intensive in the costs required to present them to you."
Laura: We'll pay whatever cost you need.
Sam: No, we should haggle, don't you think?
Laura: No.
Orion: I lick the cleric.
Matt: (chuckles) The cleric  "Oh no, that-- that's, that's very--"
Sam: How much will it take to save our friends?
Laura: Sir, anything.
Matt: He says  "For this one, we require a donation to the temple of Sarenrae of a hundred gold pieces."
Laura: Oh, done.
Matt: He steps forward, and touches the side of your head on your temple and begins to focus. The symbol of Sarenrae begins to glow on the front of his clavicle. And suddenly, you can see these strange, gray veins that had wrapped around the sides of Tiberius's head retract, dissipate then fade, as intelligence swells back into your brain. And for the first time in at least the past half an hour or so, you are back to being Tiberius Stormwind.
Orion: (licking sounds)
Sam: Well, that's uncalled for.
Marisha: Could there be side effects or something?
Orion: No, I just wanted to really do that. That was really inconvenient. Let's help Vax.
Sam: Oh. You're with us again.
Orion: Yes.
Sam: Oh, well, welcome back. How was it, being dumb?
Orion: I was quite frightened, most of the time. I didn't know what was going on. I couldn't cast spells and I was-- Let's help Vax.
Liam: You didn't shit yourself, so you're a winner.
Orion: That's good, yes. You shit yourself, Vax? I cast Prestidigitation on his butt.
Liam: What the-- Oh.
Laura: You're clean; don't worry.
Matt: Okay. As you bring Vax forward, the cleric leans forward. "What is wrong with this one?"
Laura: He was bitten by something quite unholy.
Matt: "Oh. The good news is, if you're standing here, then most of the danger is gone. However, there might be some residual of the infection." He leans forward and inspects it for a second, reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs and presses them into it. It burns a little bit.
Marisha: Ooh, do I recognize what herbs he's using?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: Nature check?
Liam: Is it sticky?
Marisha: 19, so 29.
Matt: This is glissfoil. Glissfoil is used by many medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away infections and cleansing wounds.
Taliesin: He didn't even look down. He just said it.
Liam: Who didn't know that here, honestly.
Matt: As he presses in, he looks to you. "As long as this doesn't get infected, it should be all right. I assume, based on what you say, the nature of these wounds, that is some sort of--"
Laura: They drank his blood.
Matt: "Vampirism."
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: "From what I know of vampirism, it requires many tastes of your life force and bringing you to the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn you."
Liam: Listen, doc, I can't bite anybody here. Are you sure?
Matt: "Unless this is some unnatural thing beyond classic vampirism, you should be fine."
Liam: What do you mean, unnatural?
Laura: Well, any vampirism is a little unnatural.
Marisha: Excuse me? Do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that I could take with me? That way I can just keep up on his daily disinfection.
Matt: "Certainly." He reaches into a pouch and pulls out a handful of glissfoil. It's like a dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a little bit and gives it to you.
Marisha: Thank you so much.
Orion: As it happens, I reach for my decanter and I can control the charge; it's just charged, but I dissipate the charge. But also keep it for a little bit? No, I dissipate the whole thing. And I turn to the cleric and I go, oh holy man which cured my mind, would you be so graceful as to use the force of Sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen?
Sam: To what the water?
Orion: To bless it. I'm going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically.
Matt: "There are rituals, but they take some time. If you'd like to leave it here, we could make use of this and bless the contents of it, yes."
Orion: No, I thought you could like do a Hosannah and get me out of here.
Matt: "Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. But should you require such blessing, we would be happy to oblige."
Orion: Wonderful! How many days, give or take, do you think it might take to accomplish?
Matt: "For that amount there? Two days."
Orion: Oh wonderful! We'll be here for two days, guys?
Liam: Probably will.
Orion: I'll leave it with you.
Matt: "For this volume--" He looks at it for a second and says, "This is an enchanted vial, is it not?"
Orion: Yes! Good eye!
Matt: "I'm curious to see how this will interact with the enchantment. We'll try. We'll put it at a 25 gold donation for the two days of enchantment."
Orion: I give you 50.
Matt: "Thank you."
Orion: Thank you for your service. The other 25 is for my brain.
Matt: "Well, is there anything else I can do to help you this evening?"
Sam: Thank you for all your assistance. Did he tell us a price for fixing Vax?
Matt: "That was a simple disinfection. There's no price for that. We're happy to heal here."
Laura: Thank you so much.
Sam: Our friend Pike would be much, much grateful for your service.
Matt: "Pike Trickfoot?"
Marisha: Yes, do you remember her?
Laura: She's in Vasselheim, restoring another temple of Sarenrae at this moment.
Liam: Spreading the good word.
Matt: This deep smile brings his face from this deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you hadn't seen before, and he goes, "I had not known that our lady had reach as far as Vasselheim." (offscreen thud)
Liam: Oh dear.
Matt: "It appears you've messed yourself."
Liam: Sorry! Is that blessed holy water? I'm sorry. I'll pay for that.
Matt: "I'm happy to hear that she has continued carrying her faith to distant lands, and that she has recovered well since our last meeting."
Laura: She has.
Liam: She's thriving.
Matt: "Good."
Sam: And one more thing before we leave. If you need any items, be they gear or blades, go to Gilmore's! Gilmore's Glorious Goods! Today!
Orion: You don't have to sell it--
Sam: We're supposed to plug him, right? I don't know.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Liam: That was a little ham-fisted, but he does speak the truth. Gilmore makes a quality item.
Sam: 25.
Liam: That was very awkward, Scanlan, but it's true.
Matt: He goes "Gilmore? I think I've seen that shop around."
Laura: They're opening a shop in here-- just kidding. There's a shop here!
Sam: There is a shop here!
Matt: "Me and the clerics might have to go see it, then."
Marisha: Tell them Vox Machina sent you!
Sam: And you get ten percent off.
Liam: If you say Vax'ildan sent you, you might get 15.
Matt: "Good to know. Appreciate that. Nevertheless, sleep calls to me. I must get back to--"
Laura: Sleep calls to us as well, sir.
Matt: "Well, good night and adieu to you all."
Laura: Thank you for opening your doors.
Sam: Hey, oh, what was your name? For the next time we have a dead ally.
Liam: (laughs) Oh, tomorrow, you mean?
Matt: "Tristan."
Sam: Cleric Tristan? Thank you, Cleric Tristan.
Matt: "Of course."
Sam: Blessed be Sarenrae's name.
Orion: And I awkwardly bow out and say  See you in two days, oh mighty brain fixer.
Matt: He steps back. The lights dim on the inside of the temple as you exit. You guys step out into the cold night air on the streets of Emon.
Liam: (yelling) I'm alive!
Laura: That's loud. That hurt.
Travis: Sorry, headphones.
Liam: I am sorry to everyone watching at home for blowing out the mic, but gods damn it, I'm alive.
Sam: That was close.
Marisha: Yeah, actually, while we walk back to Greyskull, what happened?
Liam: I thought that I could get a peeky-poo at what they actually were, who they were, and let's face it, I fucked up is what I did. And Grog? You may shave off my pubic region, or draw a dick on my head, if you want, tomorrow. Vex'ahlia, I'm sorry for not staying close by. Scanlan, we're good.
Sam: I saved your life.
Liam: Tiberius, you are smart and I am very stupid. You are extremely handsome and I am ugly.
Orion: I don't disagree with any of that.
Marisha: It would have been true 30 minutes ago.
Liam: And I'm sorry. And Percy, I'm especially sorry. To you most of all. We weren't ready, you weren't ready.
Taliesin: We haven't failed. It's not over yet. I'm not done.
Laura: We'll hunt them down.
Marisha: They said your family was still there.
Taliesin: They're liars. My family is dead.
Sam: We'll track them down, we'll find them, we'll kill them, and seek revenge.
Orion: And then we'll loot their bodies.
Taliesin: I don't think we'll have to.
Sam: You don't think we'll have to?
Taliesin: I think they're going to find us.
Sam: They won't attack us! We're many, and they're few.
Travis: That we know of.
Orion: Just because we're in a keep does not mean we are safe.
Laura: We need to set alarms around our keep.
Sam: We also need to protect our new friend, Lillith fair, over here.
Liam: Is that your last name?
Sam: Well, she's white, so I thought maybe--
Kit: My family name is Daturai.
Marisha: How do you spell that?
Kit: (chuckles) In your tongue? D-A-T-U-R-A-I.
Liam: I lost track after the D.
Kit: You have had a rough evening, it's understandable.
Laura: I hope you've learned your lesson.
Liam: It'll be two weeks, at least, before I do anything--
Laura: Quite so stupid and reckless--
Marisha: We had a code word.
Orion: We had Jumanji!
Laura: Jenga.
Orion: Oh, sorry. Damn it!
Laura: Where's Trinket?
Matt: You look back at this point and you see, as you guys are reaching the outer wall of Emon, (galloping noise) behind you. (happy bear noises) Rubs up against you. (moans)
Laura: Your uncle almost died! I almost died. Did you know I almost died, darling?
Matt: Licks the side of your face.
Liam: I lean in, and I lick his nose with my own tongue. And then I let him lick me all over the place.
Matt: (sloppy bear noises)
Taliesin: Vax.
Liam: Yeah?
Taliesin: Thank you. Thank you for your risk. Yes, you were foolish, but thank you.
Travis: I walk up to Vax and I extend my hand, and I say, I'm glad you didn't die.
Liam: I love you, Grog. Would you like to draw balls on my forehead?
Travis: And I reach back, and I backhand him as hard as I can. (laughter)
Matt: Roll an attack.
Liam: I don't move at all. I just take it.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a d4, divided by two.
Laura: That's a six.
Travis: No, it's two.
Matt: Two plus your strength modifier, which I believe is four. So you take six points of backhand, bludgeoning damage as Grog (whacking). The echo from the impact.
Travis: And I say, no one kills you but me.
Laura: You deserved that.
Liam: Yeah.
Orion: Let's all get some rest, shall we?
Sam: Yes, but we'll have to prepare ourselves for an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them?
Taliesin: Well, we're going to find out in a minute.
Marisha: And don't we have a prisoner?
Laura: Yes.
Sam: And we have a guest.
Marisha: Yes, and we still haven't found what the Broker-- who he is, or what he is.
Sam: Do you need to run from the Broker, or can you stay with us for a few days?
Orion: Do you owe some money? I don't understand.
Kit: How well guarded against scrying is your keep?
Sam: Not at all.
Liam: What about your room, Tiberius?
Orion: Yes.
Laura: You're guarded against scrying in your room?
Orion: Guards against scrying? Yes, of course!
Sam: Is that true?
Laura: Against scrying.
Marisha: I'm pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against scrying.
Matt: As you guys are having this discussion, a voice rings out behind you and says, "Don't worry. It's not going to help you."
Travis: Is that little shitty Mr. Missing One Hand?
Matt: No. You turn around and look, and you can see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away from you. You see dark brown and black studded leather armor with a cloak over one shoulder. Standing straight, with a grin. Deep dark red skin, burning yellow eyes and jet black, slicked hair between two horns that jut back. A tiefling stands there, looking forward, with two individuals flanking from side to side that are slowly stepping--
Orion: I don't know what they do, but I'm raising my arm up. Who goes there? Who are you? I've had a really bad day.
Matt: The tiefling, the male tiefling, steps up forward and says, "I've no quarrel with any of you. We've been scouring this city for a fugitive for a number of weeks. And as luck would have it, you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole."
Marisha: I go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast Anti-life Shell.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And are they at the door?
Matt: You guys are walking from the outside of the wall to your keep.
Liam: Where are they?
Matt: Right now? They are coming from Emon. You guys are in this in-between section between your keep--
Liam: We're outdoors? We've left the temple?
Matt: You are, yes. And we're going to go ahead and have you guys roll initiative.
Marisha: Get close to me!
Matt: Keyleth started this.
Marisha: Get close-- what? Did I? But that's a spell I cast on myself.
Matt: Right. Casting spells, generally, for most people is a bad idea.
Kit: Natural 20! (cheering)
Matt: All right, so from a visual perspective here.
Orion: Yo, Stoneskin's up, dude. I didn't get to say that shit.
Matt: Stoneskin's up on you, Anti-life Shell. Who is where?
Travis: Tibs and I are in the front, right? Because we both took aggressive postures.
Marisha: The closer to me you are, the more you'll be guarded by the shell.
Travis: Who said I want to be guarded?
Marisha: You can still fight around it. They just can't get in.
Matt: All righty. Trinket is over this side here.
Taliesin: And we have a prisoner.
Matt: The prisoner was brought to your keep by the guards.
Travis: As close to the enemy as possible. Tiberius and I took the aggressive stance.
Matt: Yes, you guys would be up that way. All right.
Laura: Oh no, why is there more than one person?
Travis: He said two people are flanking him.
Matt: As you look at this point, you notice the two individuals. To the left there is a sickly-looking older woman with dark, verdant clothing that flows and drags behind her. To the right is a shirtless humanoid with darker, scarred skin, very muscular, shirtless torso, wearing a white, featureless mask over the face. And they both curl to the sides. The initiative was... What's the initiative order here? So who got 25 to 20? All righty. 20?
Laura: 20.
Kit: 21.
Orion: And 20.
Matt: And 20 for you, as well? All right... Okay. 20 to 15?
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19, nice. Grog, what did you get?
Travis: 18.
Matt: 18.
Travis: My magic, man.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Liam: 13.
Matt: 13.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: All righty. Percy?
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: What'd you say, Keyleth, you got 11?
Marisha: 11. Bringing up the rears.
Matt: All right. Is that everybody? Cool. We're good. So. As you (crash), how big is the radius of the Anti-life Shell?
Marisha: Anyone within ten feet of me. A decent amount right now. Not Tiberius, not Scanlan.
Laura: Not Trinket.
Matt: Not technically Grog, because Grog would be up front right there. So a ten-foot radius around you. And what does it do, Anti-life Shell?
Marisha: Nothing aside from undead and constructs can get into it. You can still cast spells, and fire bows, and you can still do stuff. We can go out, they just can't get in.
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: The top of the round, the Broker goes. Rolled a very high initiative. High dex character.
Travis: That is the Broker.
Matt: Yep. "Sweet Lillith, you've been a very bad girl. Nefertiri, Nethspira, and Bellenore would all like to have a word with you. They've paid quite a bit of sum, and proven legally: you need to be taken back. Now, to your friends here, it's your choice: the easy way, or the hard way."
Kit: I use Minor Illusion, one of my cantrips, and I puff up like a cloud of nightmare, and I glow, and my eyes come alight. My tail whips, my fangs get longer. Oh, I bet you did. I bet they paid you so much. You tell my sister, I hope her face still festers.
Matt: "Choice is made." And with that, (whoosh) he vanishes from sight.
Liam: Ooh!
Matt: That ends his turn.
Orion: Wait, is he casting that? Did he cast Vanish?
Matt: There was a casting, yes.
Orion: Sweet. Counterspell.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll a d20.
Orion: 4th-level, too.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Do you mean 6th-level?
Orion: No.
Matt: It's a spell.
Orion: (humming) What is this? What?
Matt: Oh no, it just fails. You don't have to roll for this one, this is Invisibility. So as he goes to vanish, you "Oh!" as a reaction, pull out your Counterspell, and his image shimmers, and then returns. "Oh, that's not even fair."
Orion: I haven't gotten to do much today. And you won't, either.
Matt: Very good. Well, he's then going to use his move action to shift over this way to there. All right, that ends him. Lillith, you're up.
Kit: Okay. I would like to...
Liam: Buy a vowel.
Sam: Come on, Kit Buss! Come on, fuck him up! Kit Buss!
Kit: Can I use Phantasmal Killer again, please?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah. All right, against which one?
Kit: Against the Broker.
Matt: All righty, so he's going to go ahead and make his wisdom saving throw. What's your DC?
Kit: 17.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll 4d10 psychic damage.
Laura: 4d10? Holy shit! Do you need extra ones? Here's a gold one for you.
Kit: Thank you! Oh wow, I have so many pretty dice right now! It's lovely. Ooh, yeah! Ooh, so 29.
Liam: Little bit of Kit.
Matt: This is blending in, because the spell usually triggers on the start of his next turn. This is you both going at the same time, and conjoining your Minor Illusion fear into hitting him with this spell and working. It's this combination of everything hitting at once. All right, and as that hits, you see, he looks at you, and his expression goes from glee to terror. And he's immediately reconsidering his decision here. Do you want to stay where you are, or do you want to move?
Kit: I'll stay where I am.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Vex, you're up. Tiberius, you're up at the same time. We'll go with Vex first.
Laura: I want to tell Trinket to cannonball over the two lined up right there!
Matt: All right, Trinket (galloping sounds) rolls forward and (bear rolling sounds). Both of them try to move out of the way, they both get their dex save. All right, so Broker manages to pull out of the way just in time. However, the other, the big, thicker character doesn't quite have the dexterity to shift out of the way and takes the full impact. Okay. He suffers 14 points of bludgeoning damage as Trinket tears through.
Laura: Eat it! Go, Trinket!
Matt: He is knocked prone.
Laura: Good job, buddy! Little buddy!
Matt: That's Trinket's attack.
Laura: Then I get a move, still. I mean, I get an action. I'm going attack him! I'm going to attack the Broker!
Matt: For how that works for you and your bear, because that's his attack this turn.
Laura: I mean, yes. I'm assuming that's his attack, or was that his move?
Matt: Well, that's his attack. It's been a while since you attacked with Trinket.
Laura: I get to have Trinket attack, and then I get to attack.
Matt: Once, right.
Laura: Wait, attack action plus Trinket attack. It says one attack for me and two attacks for Trinket.
Liam: Trinket gets two attacks.
Matt: You can make one attack yourself while commanding it, so you get one weapon attack.
Liam: I think you should erase that and write seven.
Matt: As Trinket goes by, since it didn't hit him, he gets an attack of opportunity on Trinket. Does hit. Trinket does take seven points of slashing damage from the Broker as he misses him and he hits as he goes by.
Laura: But he's got armor on. All right, fine.
Matt: He rolled a 21 to hit.
Laura: Okay, and then I'm going to shoot an arrow. Okay. That would be 26.
Matt: 26 against the Broker? All right, go for it.
Laura: 14. I'm going to assume-- I mean, it's probably way too far, but I want to keep my Hunter's Mark on Lord Briarwood for the time being. So I'm not going to break that, even though he's probably far away, so it's just 14 damage to the Broker.
Matt: All right. The Broker's going to make a concentration check. Maintains concentration. All right. As the arrow (whooshing) moves out of the way, hits the armor, and splinters past, not dealing any physical damage, but you see the Broker is now visibly shaken by the two members of the party and sweat is starting to bead. His confidence he strolled into is quickly failing. All right, that ends Vex's turn. Tiberius.
Orion: Okay. Can I see the Broker where I am at now?
Matt: Grog's in the way. You can barely see.
Orion: I doesn't matter, I can see good enough. I'm going to spend three sorcery points and heighten my spell, which gives disadvantage on both those two rolls. I'm going to cast a 5th-level Fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two buttholes.
Matt: Here?
Liam: Don't hit Trinket!
Matt: Right there it would hit both of them and not hit Trinket.
Orion: There it is.
Matt: Okay, so they both have disadvantage on their saving throws?
Orion: That's what heighten spell does.
Matt: Okay, cool. As you arc around the side, you release the one single beam of flashing red energy, sparks at the end of the finger, lobs forward. (explosion) With a gargantuan explosion, red flames swirl into the area, sending the whole area, the dark part of the night, open field alight. You see all the green, dried grass is immediately burnt to a black crisp. Go ahead and roll damage. What's the DC?
Orion: 17.
Matt: Yeah, they both fail with disadvantage. Full damage.
Sam: All the dice!
Orion: All of them.
Liam: (laughs) Oh my god!
Orion: And then I'm going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell. And then I'm going to use the six and I'm going to choose one, two, three, and four, and five, and six to re-roll.
Liam: Think of how handy that would've been against the Briarwoods.
Orion: Four, five, six. Okay, I'm going to roll these.
Sam: Much better.
Laura: That's amazing.
Matt: You can only use one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it.
Orion: Empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic. I can do it.
Matt: Oh interesting. Good to know. Thank you for the heads up. That's cool. I like that.
Sam: 38. 41.
Orion: 46.
Matt: 46.
Orion: (spellcasting sound effect)
Matt: As the explosion bursts forth, the flames dissipate. You can see the Broker there looking angry, frightened. Immediately takes some of the flame...
Orion: Before he does that, I go (laughing), I look over at Keyleth, and I use bonus action to cast Misty Step and I go right next to her and I vanish.
Matt: Okay. You vanish behind her, and as he pulls back the flames and then releases them they snake between everyone and go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Orion: I make it. But it's fire?
Matt: It is fire damage.
Orion: Good, instead of missing it I'm going to (swoosh, gulps) swallow it. (grunts) That's 20. My dex save was 20. Sorry.
Matt: Oh, okay, good thank you for the heads up on that.
Travis: You swallowed it?
Matt: So you take half damage. The angry tiefling hits you with a Hellish Rebuke.
Orion: Blowing smoke through my nose (snorts).
Matt: It would be seven damage. You take half damage from fire, so that would be four fire damage as you take the Hellish Rebuke's burst of flaming, dark, arcane energy and (gulps) swallow it and take it in. You blow it out the side of your nostrils. And it burns, but damn does it look cool.
Orion: And that's my turn.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? Shit. Is that the old lady over there?
Matt: Over here on this side, yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll take a step towards her and I will try-- it's never worked for me, it probably won't work. I'll try Eyebite on her.
Liam: This is the time. Right here, right now.
Sam: What do I roll? I'm doing it through my Horn of Clarity or whatever.
Matt: All right, so it's a wisdom saving throw on her end. What's the DC on that? Is it 19?
Sam: 19.
Matt: Okay. So no, that does not make it. So what're you choosing?
Sam: Okay. I choose Sleep. (singing) Rock-a-bye, old lady.
Matt: So she turns around, she's holding this gnarled wand in her hand, as she comes around she gives you this strange look and goes "What?" And falls unconscious on the ground asleep.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Liam: "I didn't watch Matlock--"
Sam: And then I'll just inspire our new tiefling friend with a little sexy dance.
Kit: Is he always like this?
Laura: Yes, he is. Don't you feel so inspired?
Kit: Oh, you have no idea.
Matt: You take a d10 inspiration dice. It makes you laugh. It's less of an attraction thing and more of a, "Oh, gnomes. They're so small."
Kit: Oh, how special.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: All right, everybody's doing new stuff. With 50-foot speed, can I get to the far side of the old lady that's sleeping?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I get like behind her so I can-- I need the laser pointer.
Taliesin: You want to get right there, right?
Travis: Yes. Yeah, on the opposite side of her from where I am.
Sam: She's asleep. What are you going to do?
Liam: Kill that motherfucker!
Matt: You can get there.
Travis: That's what I'd like to do.
Marisha: She will wake up. Unless you cleave her in half, she will wake up.
Laura: It's Grog. He doesn't give a shit about that.
Travis: I take out the Javelin of Lightning. I whisper the command word, which is Penelope, and I throw it in a straight line, which will hit all three of them, in a five-foot-wide line that extends 120 feet.
Laura: You're so smart, Grog!
Taliesin: You just did math!
Laura: Look at you! When it comes to battle, he knows things.
Matt: All right, so that's five foot wide, so it'll hit him and one of these, or her and one of these two guys. It hits something in a five-foot line.
Travis: The guy that's standing.
Laura: Yeah, the Broker. Get the Broker.
Matt: So you pull it out and as you throw it downward. The javelin goes from a metallic blade into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams downward. Penelope does not-- not Penelope. You keep shouting it at me. The old woman on the ground gets no saving throw because she's unconscious and she takes double damage.
Travis: Double damage?
Matt: So 4d6.
Travis: 4d6. 14.
Liam: Killed that old woman so good.
Travis: And if he makes a saving throw of a DC 13, it's halved.
Matt: The javelin arcs through and goes towards there, and then he does make his dexterity saving throw against that. He's a pretty dexterous guy.
Travis: It takes a little shock, though.
Matt: Right, so it takes a little bit of damage which was, what was it you rolled, was it a 14? So it takes seven points of lightning damage for that, and then make a ranged attack on the actual javelin.
Travis: What does that do? I don't even have that on here. I have no idea.
Matt: Oh, sorry. That was against the target, so since he was the target, he takes the impact. The lightning bolt arcs through the old woman. She (screams) shakes awake, screaming as the bolt arcs upward from the ground, and right before it goes toward the Broker, as he rears back in fear, it solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams into the front of his torso. He's like, (grunting, gasping). He pulls it out. Shakes it for a second, looking at it, confused.
Travis: I look at Tiberius and I go, I did magic!
Orion: It was very impressive. Good job, Grog!
Travis: Thank you! Penelope.
Orion: That's my mother's name.
Laura: Oh no, he got up.
Matt: The guy gets up and only has a half move.
Laura: Can he get that close?
Matt: On half movement, yeah. Runs up to you. As he does so you can see, holding on his side, gets up and goes bolting towards you, arcing around the side.
Marisha: He runs, he runs smack-dab into my wall. My arcane--
Matt: Anti-life Shell. The Anti-life Shell does--
Marisha: Blocks living things. They can't come in.
Orion: Unless you invite them.
Marisha: Like vampires.
Matt: It was a ten-foot radius you said?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Vax'ildan flips him the double birds as he hits the wall.
Laura: From inside the wall.
Matt: So he's unable to, just runs forward, hits the barrier, skids past, hold his place there instead then.
Liam: That's unfortunate!
Matt: However, has a spear.
Laura: Oh shit. (laughter)
Matt: Still rushes around with it, both hands on it, arcing towards you with it. That is going to be--
Liam: Can I use Uncanny Dodge with it? Or is it too late?
Matt: Well, that's okay, it rolled a three to hit, plus eight, that's going to be an 11 so no. It just (whiffing) It swings wide with the spear. This is going very poorly for them. All right, Vax, it's your turn now.
Liam: Okay, so I look around at all these amazing people that I am so blessed to be with and barely even looking, I just go dagger, dagger, dagger over this asshole's head at the Broker. Yeah. The first one is, not that great, but it's all right. It's an 18. These guys are dickheads.
Matt: All right, 18 against the Broker just barely hits.
Liam: All right. That's ten points of damage. The second dagger hits him, I hope. 19?
Matt: All right, that does hit, yeah.
Liam: For ten points of damage. And then I'll throw my Dagger of Venom at him, see what happens. Oh, the same hit, same amount. The last one hit. This one hits. That is three, six, nine. Plus, he has to make a saving throw against a DC 15 for poison.
Matt: Constitution. He is going to fail that.
Liam: Yeah, go fuck yourself. That's not the right die is what that is. Let's see, poison damage is-- that's not great. Ten. Ten points of poison. You are awesome! (whooshing)
Sam: Wait, what if Lillith is the bad guy instead of the good guy?
Liam: Kit Buss is not a bad guy!
Matt: All right, so you're staying where you are?
Liam: Where I am. I'll stay where I am
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to walk to the very edge of the spell right here, so I'm standing one closer to our friend there. Not just to you. I want to be close to the big strong schmuck.
Matt: Okay, so right there?
Taliesin: Is the Broker holding anything? Is he, is he using a weapon?
Matt: The Broker you see has like a shortsword out. He's currently tossing it and catching it.
Taliesin: Just a shortsword?
Matt: Or he's tossing it and catching it but like (grunts). He's having a bad day. The Broker was not prepared for Vox Machina.
Taliesin: Okay. Before I start to do anything I'm going to look at him, look him in the eye: What is wrong with you? Don't you see there is nothing here for you? Run away before you die! There is no option! And I'm just going to start unloading. Natural 20! (yelling)
Liam: Damn, son!
Taliesin: Pepperbox.
Marisha: What is wrong with you?
Liam: Percival de something something something de Rolo the III, you badass motherfucker!
Taliesin: That's 16 points of damage.
Matt: That's to the Broker?
Taliesin: To the Broker. I'm just shooting at the Broker.
Matt: 16 points? That is doubling the dice?
Taliesin: That is doubling both of the dice. Now a sharpshooter shot.
Matt: The Broker can't do anything. It already used its reaction.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter shot misses. And another shot, seven, 19?
Matt: 19 hits.
Taliesin: All right, cool. That's eight points of damage. Blowing an action surge and firing three more times.
Sam: Three more? That seems terribly unfair.
Taliesin: That's 25... that's ten points of damage, plus four points of fire damage. Sharpshooter shot. That's a 22. That's 21 points of damage. Another sharpshooter shot with ice fire. Finally, I get the breakdown on that one. The gun jammed. I put it away.
Marisha: But that was awesome. That was pretty dope.
Taliesin: How many fired shots did I get? Was that five shots or six shots?
Matt: That, that was five shots. Well, all in all, it was six shots, but five hits.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'm out of-- all right. I don't have any more actions.
Matt: Yeah. That's okay (chuckles). First and foremost, How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Did you see the nostril? His little nostril twitch.
Matt: I feel bad for him. (laughter)
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to do something weird here and I'm going to hold you onto this. I'm going to get a little weird, and I'm taking straight chest shots and I'm just firing chest shots, and I'm just making a hole the size of a baseball in his chest. And as it happens, as I keep unloading, the gun still breaks and I'm still pulling the trigger.
Matt: (booming, gasping, coughing)
Taliesin: (yelling) You fool, your soul is forfeit! Die! Die! I'm going to look at the other two and start pulling out my bigger gun.
Matt: Make an intimidation check with advantage.
Taliesin: And putting on the fucking mask.
Matt: With a d6 inspiration dice.
Liam: Picked a bad day to do your job, son!
Taliesin: A d6 inspiration die?
Marisha: And advantage. With advantage and a d6.
Taliesin: Oh, this is embarrassing. 17, wait with intimidation, 19.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Mask, gun, fuck it.
Matt: Standing there, smoking, giant hole, Tombstone style, in the center of his chest. There would be no dripping, except for the cauterization of the heat round that exploded in his chest and is a blackened, cinderous tube where once there was a chest cavity. The Broker (death rattle, thud) falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound on the ground. As you stare at the other two, screaming that out, you can see the old woman who's still on the ground. (panicked gasps) Looks extremely out of place and freaked out.
Sam: Sorry, Doris. You'd better just lie down.
Matt: The masked individual, from what you can tell behind the eyes of the mask, does not seem emotionally affected by this.
Taliesin: Also, just checking, does my glove still have a charge, by the way?
Matt: It may.
Taliesin: Okay. I mean, is there any indication, like it would have a slight glow to it.
Matt: There is a slight vibration. That ends your turn?
Taliesin: That is the end of my turn.
Matt: All right. The old woman gets up and is like, (panicked gasps).
Liam: (old lady voice) I feel happy. I feel alive.
Sam: You're in Atlantic City. Everything's okay.
Matt: As a bonus action, casts Misty Step and appearing 30 feet over here.
Travis: Do I get to swing?
Matt: No. Because Misty Step happens.
Travis: Damn Misty and her steps.
Matt: She stands up and vanishes in a swirl of vapor. She appears a little ways away in the field and immediately, (mumbles a spell).
Orion: Counterspell! 5th-level. Fuck it.
Matt: You would be able to, because it has been your turn, you would have your reaction back. So yes, you could. So go ahead and roll a d20.
Laura: Matt's like, damn you and your Counterspells. You're ruining my plan.
Orion: 23.
Matt: (laughs) So she (mumbles a spell, gasps). (laughter)
Travis: That's the best running I've ever seen! The little gait!
Matt: Tries to run away, the slippery wet grass, she slips a little bit as she's trying to get away now.
Laura: I feel bad for her.
Matt: That ends her turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Upon seeing Percy go absolutely insane and screaming "your soul is now forfeit," out of shock, my Anti-Life Shell dissipates, and I spend my action staring at him.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Wow. Going for the roleplay, not the damage.
Matt: The Broker's not getting a turn. Lillith, you're up.
Kit: Okay. I would like to use Animate Dead on the Broker, please.
Liam: (gasps) You nasty woman, you.
Laura: He's so happy about it.
Matt: You can begin using it, because it's a one-minute casting time. You have to get closer because you're probably a ways away.
Kit: Right. Okay.
Liam: You've got a naughty streak.
Kit: It's my family. I cannot help it.
Matt: We'll say, from there you begin concentrating on Animate Dead as you begin pulling through and speaking in guttural tones that have multiple layers of tonality and volume. It's this weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins to speak. You can see now the smoking, ruined body of the Broker begins to shift and twitch on its own. So that'll conclude your turn, Lillith. Vex and Tiberius, you guys are up.
Marisha: You've got asshole.
Laura: I'm going to attack him with a bow. I'm going to attack him with my Entangle arrow.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: All right.
Matt: The big guy?
Laura: Yeah. The guy in the mask. He's the only one left right? Oh, the old lady's still running away? All right, I'll attack the guy in the mask.
Liam: That old lady has to die!
Laura: That's a 28.
Matt: Yeah, that definitely hits.
Laura: All right, 15. Plus Entangle, whatever.
Matt: All right. Good to know. And so as you pull back the arrow and release it, there is that-- the way that you constructed it, there's just this pouch of very thick gooey-- is this the spell or is it the actual arrow constructed by Percy?
Laura: It's the arrow.
Matt: Right, the one that he built? So what happens is that the front of the arrow, it doesn't do any actual damage on the impact. Instead what it does is it, when it smacks into it, there's a pouch in the front that detonates from the impact and sends this very quick-setting tar, like glue substance. That just spatters across the body and lower torso, it expands like a foam. There's no damage on that one, but it's currently (grunts) grappled by it and cannot move from its place.
Laura: Awesome. And so I'll shoot another arrow at the other lady.
Matt: Okay. Go for it. Roll for an attack.
Laura: I know she's running away, but she's a bad guy. I didn't hit her, though.
Matt: What did you roll?
Laura: 16.
Matt: Heh. It's funny-- mages don't have a lot of armor. Even with mage armor, you manage to hit her square in the back. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 16.
Matt: She goes (cries out) and stumbles, and catches herself and gets back up and you can see the arrow sticking straight up out of her back. Probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade.
Marisha: This is becoming a Monty Python sketch.
Liam: (old lady voice) I feel fine. I feel happy.
Matt: Trinket growls (growls menacingly). She goes, (terrified shriek) and yelps out as the giant bear--
Travis: Will you start running for us again, please?
Matt: When we get to her turn. I'm saving it.
Laura: I'm going to command Trinket to run after her.
Matt: What's Trinket's movement?
Liam: This is like an afternoon at the gym for us.
Laura: I don't have any idea. I don't know.
Matt: Actually, I have it here. Trinket's movement is 40 feet. Okay, that's as far as Trinket can get right there. I have a little Trinket cheat sheet.
Taliesin: That is the tiniest cheat sheet ever.
Liam: Littlest character sheet ever. Can you hold that up again? Look how tiny it is! Aw, that big bear and that tiny piece of paper.
Matt: Okay, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Wait, the guy in the mask is prone?
Matt: The guy in the mask is currently grappled. His lower body is currently held in this weird tar-like substance. He's like, (grunts) trying to break free.
Sam: I only get one 6th-level spell but it says on Eyebite that every subsequent action, I can do it again.
Matt: You just choose somebody else to do it to, yeah.
Sam: I'm going to do it to her again. To the old lady again.
Matt: Let me see if you can. For another creature. But can't target a creature again-- oh, if it succeeded on a saving throw. You're right, so she can. So what do you want to do?
Laura: I think it's Tiberius's turn. He and I have the same initiative.
Matt: Oh, that's right, sorry about that.
Sam: Oh, are you going to hold?
Matt: So he waits for you to finish. But he can hold his turn.
Sam: I'll just run up, as far as I need to be within 60 feet and do it again to her.
Matt: Yeah, she's within range. And what're you doing?
Sam: Just fall asleep again. Back to sleep.
Matt: That is a 17. Nope. (panicked breathing) Falls asleep on the ground. With the arrow (arrow twang) right out of the back. And you acquiesce to Tiberius. It's your go.
Sam: Oh, and I'll inspire him. With a musical fart. (fart noise)
Orion: That was a wonderful toot, Scanlan!
Sam: Yes, thank you.
Matt: All right, d10 inspiration die. Tiberius, it's your go.
Orion: Where do I put this d10? Doesn't matter. Cool. I'm going to go as far as I can towards the old broad.
Marisha: We're focusing so much on this poor old woman and there's big intimidating--
Liam: Poor old woman? She's an evil mercenary. She deserves to be taken out!
Orion: He hasn't taken any damage, has he?
Matt: He's taken quite a bit of damage
Liam: Don't be ageist! That is an evil bitch! She needs to be killed.
Travis: Ageist?
Matt: All right, Tiberius, what're you doing? She's currently asleep on the ground. This guy's like, (grunts).
Orion: Am I within 60 feet of the old lady? That's pretty far still. Don't know whether I am or not.
Matt: Nope, she's just out of the range.
Sam: I've fallen, and I can't get up!
Orion: Okay. I am within 120 right? So what I'm going to do instead, is I'm going to look down and I'm going to pull out my Krull Blade and I'm going to throw it in the air and cast Telekinesis on it (spinning).
Matt: Okay. As you do it catches itself, spinning in the air up ahead of you, (spinning) this strange vibrating high-pitched whine sound as the blades are spinning in rapid circular motion.
Orion: And I'm going to go, (swishing) and I'm going to huck it at the chick.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a spell attack roll.
Orion: That's 31.
Matt: Yeah. It's also a critical hit because she's currently asleep. So it's an auto-crit. So go ahead and roll 5d4. A d4 for each dagger on the spinning blade, spinning at high speed. Plus five. Or 5d4 times two plus five.
Marisha: 5d4 times two plus five?
Matt: Yep. So just roll 5d4 and then multiply everything by two.
Orion: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13.
Matt: So 26 plus five is 31 points of damage. The unconscious woman face down on the ground, the blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out of her back. Spraying a bit of gore across the nearby grass. Thankfully, she was asleep, so she probably didn't feel it, it was so fast. But she is definitively gone.
Marisha: We are being sadistic today.
Orion: And I'll bring it back to me. I'll keep it hovering, maintain the spell. I'm going to bonus action Misty Step towards where Grog is. That's my turn.
Matt: I'll say for the sake of brevity at this point, because you have a glued guy, and the entire team pretty much at full health here, over time you all slowly gather around the guy who's glued to the ground. And he's fighting at first, (grunts) and you see he lowers his head, giving into his fate.
Orion: Smart to not test your fate, boy.
Travis: Lillith, can I go play t-ball with his head?
Liam: No. Let him live. Let this one live.
Travis: What, we're letting people live now?
Matt: At which point the head lifts he goes  "No. Kill me, give me honor. I have fallen."
Liam: Oh, I'm sorry I retract that.
Orion: Krull Blade in the neck.
Marisha: Oh you just elbowed me.
Liam: Did you just hit Keyleth's funny bone?
Marisha: Yes, right in the funny bone.
Orion: It's kind of funny.
Liam: Grog, will you kill this guy?
Kit: If honor is what he wants, do not give it to him. Let him live.
Laura: Ooh, I like it. I walk up and I take his mask off.
Matt: All right, you pull the mask off--
Liam: I know what to do-- Scanlan. This is your moment. Shit on his face.
Laura: No, that's disgusting!
Sam: Listen, that's not just something I can do whenever.
Liam: Who are you kidding?
Sam: I have to be in the mood, I need music, some nice lighting, I need to be wined and dined a bit.
Liam: My sister's right. Do it on his chest.
Matt: At which point, you pop the mask off, and from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers the face--
Sam: This is the Broker?
Laura: This is the masked guy.
Matt: You can the face beneath. It's humanoid, but right as you get past the nose and the mouth area, it's all melted, like a horrible acid burn. There's severe damage to the face. He looks at you and goes "Kill me. It's all I have."
Laura: Sorry, darling. You live.
Matt: (angry growl) And it's flexing and reaching out at you but it can't quite get the range. It's going to attempt to try to-- no it just cannot break free of that (strained grunts). As you're still concentrating on the spell, slowly the Broker steps up, the eyes rolled back and white, the giant wound in the chest, hobbles towards you.
Liam: It was almost my turn. Can I throw daggers at him?
Laura: No, she just reanimated him.
Liam: You reanimated him? Oh then, never mind. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Matt: As you pull your blade out, she commands and gives a hand motion, and the Broker hobbles towards her.
Kit: My sisters, they sent you? They are still hunting me?
Matt: You look down. The mark that was there on your chest has vanished. Upon the point of the Broker's death, whatever enchantment was placed upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was abolished.
Kit: Return to Palac Lusterka and present yourself to my sisters. Let them see what good it will do them to hunt me.
Matt: Turns around and starts shambling off.
Orion: Oh, wait a minute, hold on. And I as he's walking away, I'm going to loot that dude. Take shit off him. Come on. Hold on, let me take this.
Matt: There is a mostly ruined set of studded leather armor that is enchanted, plus one. It's basic, but it's need of serious repair as it currently has a large gaping hole in the chest area. And a shortsword. Plus-one Vicious Shortsword. As Tiberius is pulling everything off of the corpse as it's trying to shamble away into the distance. Eventually, this half-naked ruined body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the night.
Laura: What about the old lady? Do we get any loot off her?
Matt: (laughs) The old lady has mostly a basic wand. It's a plus-one wand.
Laura: Here's a wand. I toss it back to them.
Liam: Scanlan? Tibs? Who wants a wand?
Sam: I'll take it. All right.
Matt: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.
Marisha: Plus-one Wand of the War Mage.
Matt: A simple Ring of Protection.
Laura: There's a ring. I take it, put it on. For the time being.
Matt: And about roughly 320 gold. Amongst the two of them. At this point in time, the other guy's exhausted himself now, just still in place. You see the Broker vanish into the shadows, heading southward.
Marisha: Shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy?
Orion: Hold on a second, why would we keep this one around to tell us now? What'd be the point? I will kill this man unless you give me a good reason not to.
Kit: I look at him and I ask, this? My sisters, they are responsible for this?
Matt: He gives you a look for a second. "I've been this my whole life. They gave me purpose. I follow them, and you've hurt the Mistresses."
Kit: That is true. I did do something similar to Bellenore's face. But they will not give you purpose. You are better out of their shadow. Trust me, I know. You should find better purpose for yourself. Go. Be free. I doubt that they will trouble you any more.
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.
Liam: Plus? Plus zero.
Sam: You still have my inspiration.
Laura: Inspiration! Plus ten!
Liam: (singing) Scanlan make you feel good.
Kit: 15?
Matt: 15. The tension in the muscles eventually relaxes, and the head hangs. "I know not for what reason I live."
Kit: You seem a capable fighter, yes? My cousin recently became member of the Slayer's Take in Vasselheim. Perhaps you would care to go find purpose in testing your skills there?
Laura: And if not there you can always fight in the Crucible.
Matt: (grunts)
Kit: They look for nothing but strength and honor.
Matt: At which point there's a large cracking sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg. (grunts) Breaks the other leg free and stands there now before you.
Marisha: Your purpose in life is only what you make of it.
Sam: You can do anything. You could be President of the United States.
Orion: While this is going on, I'm writing on a piece of scroll right now. Which I give to him.
Matt: "I will walk, and I will think. Perhaps I will drown." And he turns and starts walking towards the shoreline on the other side to the west--
Taliesin: Lillith, does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you?
Kit: I'm very much afraid not. This is but one of the attempts my sisters have made to find me. However, I have no intention of returning to my home.
Marisha: And what was the name of your homeland again? It sounded very exotic.
Kit: Palac Lusterka is the seat of my family. We go back very long way. But I would not recommend that you visit there. It's not the most cheerful place.
Orion: Not tourist-friendly?
Kit: Not particularly welcome, no.
Laura: I've heard some terrible things about-- what is it, your father, is it? Or is it your uncle? Your uncle.
Kit: My family in general have interesting attitudes towards affection, shall we say. My sisters-- well, you see, I'm not particularly cut out for making a good first impression. However, my sisters did always tell me that what was inside was most important. They did tell me this as they were removing intestines to divine with them, so perhaps maybe not usual meaning of this phrase, but Zahra is perhaps the member of my family that I like best.
Laura: Understandably.
Marisha: We all have those.
Liam: All we care about is deeds. You've proven yourself to great depth today.
Kit: I believe in this circumstance I pale to my present company. I've heard many wonderful things about you from Zahra, and I'm honored to not only have met you, but also to have had your aid in this matter. I'm profoundly grateful. If there is ever any opportunity at which I can return the favor, I am not useful for much, but perhaps a little smoke and mirrors I can do.
Orion: I would actually like to know how you keep your horns so shiny and clean.
Matt: The cold wind picks up as the night air begins to darken, a distant storm blowing over the horizon to the northeast. The time draws late and cold.
Marisha: Lillith, would you like to stay the night before you move on?
Kit: If I would not put you at any--
Laura: Not even a little.
Marisha: Please, have dinner with us.
Kit: Then it would be my pleasure.
Laura: And we head back to the keep.
Marisha: And I go in the back into the garden, and I take the glissfoil out of my pocket that I was given, and I revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in, and plant it in the ground.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And as the twins are walking I say, clearly, I'm eating shit here today. I guess I'm going to make a promise not to stray from your side.
Laura: Remember that promise.
Liam: I promise.
Sam: I lick Tiberius. (laughter)
Orion: That's what that feels like.
Matt: That will be our freeze-frame credit high-five for the evening.
Travis: Nice job, Kit! (cheering)
Matt: Thank you so much, Kit, for guesting with us this evening, and for coming out and visiting us.
Kit: Thank you so much for having me. We've had an absolutely amazing week and-- oh, it's really nice to speak in my own accent again.
Taliesin: Your accent good. We enjoy.
Kit: Thank you. No, it's been absolutely amazing. It really has been an honor and you will definitely be seeing me again in LA, because this was wonderful. Thank you so much.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: And everybody check her out on twitter.
Marisha: What's your twitter?
Kit: My twitter is AnemoneTea dot-- not even dot com, just AnemoneTea. It's that simple.
Matt: Travis and Laura have to run to catch a plane flight. You guys go, rock it out, safe flight. You guys are off to...?
Laura: A wedding. And our anniversary is tomorrow. (cheering)
Travis: But we got to go.
Matt: Go. Travel safe. Bye, guys.
Laura: I love you guys.
Liam: Can I hold your mug? I want to see what it feels like. Wow! Look at the size of that.
Sam: It's still got some booze in there, if you want to take a slurp.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: All right. As a note, just so you guys are aware, we had a contest yesterday about 5:30 in the afternoon during one of the streams. We had everyone who was currently present in the chat room be part of this random drawing, and the winner was a David Kingsbury, who won the opportunity to provide the name and essence of an NPC in our campaign. The Broker is actually their construction.
Kit: That's amazing!
Matt: The Broker was designed by one of our viewers, one of our Critters.
Taliesin: Thank you for the target practice.
Kit: Thank you so much!
Marisha: That is so cool.
Kit: That's amazing.
Matt: We're hoping to do stuff like that every now and then in the future to bring in some Critters to throw their creative mind in here and incorporate a character into our world. My heart's been going a mile a minute that entire game, because no DM wants to have to kill a player.
Marisha: I was on the verge of bawling my eyes out.
Liam: If I ever died, I thought-- and I still think I'll probably be the first-- but if I ever died, I thought it would be more like a bus accident. I would just go (impact) and that'd be it. I didn't think the doctor would look at me and say, I'm sorry, you have one week to live. And the whole week I've been sweating.
Matt: Yeah, it's pretty harsh. The internet was very vocal.
Liam: Yeah, thanks guys, for putting the pressure on.
Matt: Oh man. Well, that was awesome. [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to Critical Role, the show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. My name is Matthew Mercer, I'm the Dungeon Master of the game. Welcome, new folks who haven't seen this before, hope you're not too lost, and returning Team Hooman and Critter fans, welcome back, we love having you and let's get this evening on the road. We have some announcements and things to talk about before the game actually kicks in, so we'll first pass it over here to our fantastic overlord to get that kicked off.
Zac: That's right, you get to see my ugly face for a couple minutes while I get through a couple quick announcements, guys. A lot of you have been asking me on Twitter and in the chat room when you will get to see Critical Troll? That will be up on the website tomorrow night at 8PM Pacific Standard Time. So go over to the website at 8PM, you'll be able to see that and I'm sure you guys will secretly pass around the youtube link and stuff.
Matt: Watch me go crazy.
Zac: Currently you can find Laura's article on GeekandSundry.com.
Laura: What?!
Zac: That came out today, so make sure to head over to the website and read that. And I know a lot of you are probably wondering about D&Diesel. Which is apparently the name, D&Diesel.
Laura: Yeah, it is.
Zac: Got a ring to it.
Taliesin: Hashtag D&Diesel.
Zac: Hashtag D&Diesel. That will be showing tonight during the midpoint of the show. Now, there's a couple special things with this showing, you need to watch it live. If you think that you're going to come back later, watch it on the rebroadcast, and you're gonna go dip out for a pee break or pizza break, whatever, don't! Stick around because after it shows tonight live, you will be unable to see it again until Monday on the website. So it will be cut from the rebroadcasts.
Laura: Whoa.
Zac: And I'm very sorry to our European audience. I'm really sorry about that, but that's just unfortunately how PR deals work sometimes and that's just the way it is. But, it'll only be--
Matt: It's only a few days!
Zac: Yeah, it'll only be a few days and you'll get to see a lot more on Monday. A longer cut and that's why it's a website exclusive. It's longer, it'll have some tightening and all sorts of other stuff. But, you guys get a special treat tonight with a preview showing, and it's still a long preview, it's like 20-25 minutes or something like that.
Laura: Whoa, it is?
Matt: Yeah.
Zac: It's pretty cool.
Matt: That'll be exciting.
Zac: So there's that. Tomorrow we have a very special event happening for all of those that joined us for the Extra Life campaign, thank you so much, and a lot of you guys were here as well.
Matt: Yes indeed.
Zac: And thank you for donating, getting us well past our goal, and as some of you may remember during Critical Troll, Felicia mentioned that if we reached a certain goal, she would come on, on a scheduled date and play Rock Band 4. So that's happening, tomorrow.
Matt: Yup!
Zac: We are having a battle of the bands from 5 to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, and Mr. Mercer here is going to be playing the drums.
Matt: Yeah, I'm drumming for them, which, first off, I haven't played since probably 2011, and I'm a little rusty.
Zac: Have you seen your competition?
Matt: No, but I assume they're gonna destroy me.
Zac: They're really good.
Matt: That's okay. I will narrate my failure.
Zac: There we go!
Matt: In a way that will still be as engrossing. (laughs)
Zac: And there's been a Twitter battle happening between the two teams.
Matt: Oh really?
Zac: You're kinda walking into the fire, my friend.
Matt: That's okay.
Zac: Felicia's put a lot on the line for you guy's team.
Matt: That's cool. I got fire resistance. That's fine.
Zac: Okay cool, cool. That'll be happening tomorrow 5PM to 7PM Pacific Standard Time, you guys should tune in for that. We are still going to be donating to Extra Life, but we're not really going to be pushing it, it's more of a reward for you guys for helping us get past that $75k goal.
Matt: Yes.
Zac: Our next giveaway is going to be at 9,500, we're getting pretty close. The other real quick little announcement I have as far as subs go, is last week you guys were able to get our sub train up to 420 subs, now that counts resubs and new subs. So we have the sub train going right now, I believe it's well over a hundred--
Matt: Woof.
Zac: If we break last week's record of 420 which I think they purposely stopped at 420--
Matt: (laughs) Of course they did.
Zac: Hey guys, don't go. We will do a giant giveaway of board games, D&D stuff signed by the cast, signed by the rest of the Twitch crew. We'll throw in a couple video games, t-shirts, all sorts of stuff. Plus Ivan has said if we reach that goal for TPK, which those that watched last Monday, thank you so much.
Matt: Yeah!
Zac: It's a new show on Monday nights where our Twitch cast plays as themself in Outbreak Undead. Last week, some of you saw the Twitch cast leave me for dead outside of the studio. And a lot of people thought that I might come back if given the opportunity. Well, if we break that sub goal, Ivan has said that I will come back and probably wreak havoc in some way for our Twitch host that thought they could get away with leaving me for dead in the middle of the street.
Matt: (laughs) That's awesome.
Zac: So let's break 420. The last announcement, guys, is just a real quick community announcement. We like to pride ourselves at Geek & Sundry for being a very open and loving and warm community, and that's absolutely the most important thing to us and to Felicia and to a lot of our viewers, and I know last week things got a little heated in the chat room, and we just want to remind everyone that we don't get the opportunity to talk to you much during the show, but we want to make sure you guys stay as positive as possible or I will have to throw the hammer down on you.
Matt: Shit. All right. There you--
Zac: That's pretty much it.
Matt: You know, just goes to say that this community is built on so many great, positive people and such a wonderful sense of community, and a big huge thanks and please share appreciation for our fantastic mods who work consistently and constantly throughout the day.
Zac: (sings) For free.
Matt: For free.
Zac: (laughs) You guys are crazy.
Matt: Through our chatroom, which if you've watched, as you're now seeing and have seen previous episodes, is I can only assume readable by super mastermind computers at this point. So, you guys do an amazing job, it's really appreciated and to all of you guys out there in the community, keep that positivity, keep that understanding, and enjoy our game for its ups, for its downs, for our good character choices, bad character choices. It's all an experience in a story that we're all having together at the same time. So, kick along, hold on, and keep smiling.
Zac: Well said, Matt.
Matt: Yeah, thank you.
Zac: We love you guys, kind of. (all laugh)
Matt: I do. I love you. We do.
Zac: I'm on the fence.
Matt: He's a-- you know.
Laura: We love you so much!
Matt: It's a thing. So yeah, so, couple other announcements for you guys. What's our sub count right now? When's our next one hundred?
Crew: 9.5k, 9,500.
Matt: At 9,500 we will be giving away our signed photo and signed art piece by Kit Buss to a random person who's active in the chat. So next time we hit that goal, we'll have that giveaway, which is awesome. Once again, Extra Life has been our big charity push right now. Everyone who's given, thank you so much. So, so much, and if ever you want to be a part of helping that out we have the information there available for you, it goes to a really great cause. Let's see, Sam will be here shortly. Unfortunately, we're down a Tiberius tonight. However, yesterday was Orion's birthday, so feel free to go ahead and wish him a happy birthday on Twitter.
Laura: Aw.
Liam: Happy birthday, Orion.
Travis: Happy birthday, buddy.
Matt: Happy birthday, Orion. But yeah, Sam should be here shortly. And, let's see, do we have any project announcements?
Liam: Just a project announcement?
Matt: Or any other announcements you've got.
Liam: Hey, yesterday I started directing for the World of Warcraft. So that's pretty good.
Laura: You did? (all cheer)
Matt: Congratulations, buddy.
Laura: That's so great!
Liam: I think it's gonna be ongoing and it was really nice.
Travis: Big deal.
Marisha: I'm so excited for you!
Laura: That's super exciting.
Matt: That's awesome.
Liam: Then anything right now?
Marisha: I'm so fangirly.
Matt: Anything you want.
Liam: All right, I also want to thank Pupgames from Twitter for sending me this.
Laura: Oh yeah.
Liam: Look at this. It came in the mail separate and I have a hood and now I can just, you know, I can go like that and no one will see me so thank you, Pupgames.
Matt: That's awesome!
Liam: Let me set it here. I haven't figured out how to wear it exactly, but I will.
Laura: (laugh)
Matt: (laugh)
Travis: Take all your clothes off and then figure it out.
Matt: It's warm on the chesticles.
Liam: And then, I just want to take a minute, I said thank you on Twitter, but I just want to thank everybody who for the last week has sent me well-wishes and today who has sent me well-wishes, and a lot of the Critter community got together and made a video just to, you know, just support, support me in-- I am having a hard moment in my personal life, not gonna get into it, but you guys kind of took my breath away today for real. So, thank you very much.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: We have the best fans.
Matt: This whole community is brilliant, so you guys.
Taliesin: So many of them in New York and in San Francisco this week, where we've been all over the place.
Marisha: Yes. Shout out to our New York and San Fran.
Matt: Yeah, we hit both coasts.
Marisha: San Francisco. Both coasts.
Matt: Yeah, in the same week. It's crazy. Yeah, we all went to New York Comic Con. We had a panel that went really well. We had a bunch of great critters come out and Team Hooman folks come and sit in the audience, ask questions. We had some fun banter back and forth. We gave out 'Critical Rolls,' these cookies that were our little meal deal.
Taliesin: That were neither critical nor rolls, really to be fair.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: But they were good.
Marisha: But we're into it.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Imaginary rolls.
Marisha: Imaginary rolls.
Matt: Much like our realm is imaginary.
Taliesin: I may have hit a couple people in the face, for which I greatly apologize.
Laura: I definitely hit somebody in the face with one of those rolls.
Taliesin: Yeah, I like split someone's lip.
Matt: Completely unintentional, I'm sure.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Liam: Her aim is excellent. She never misses.
Laura: Yes, I am an archer.
Travis: She Hunter's Marks that shit.
Laura: I Hunter's Marked your face.
Taliesin: And we played golf. It was quite nice.
Matt: Also, thank you guys for coming out to that event. Also, for those who came to see us at Forbidden Planet in New York, we had a great turnout, and that comic shop wasn't quite expecting what they were in for.
Travis: We weren't expecting that.
Matt: We weren't expecting, but they especially were like halfway through like, "Who are you guys?! What is happening?!"
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Travis: We are legion.
Marisha: We freaked out our Uber driver.
Matt: Yeah we did.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: We pulled up and got out of the car and all of a sudden it was like hundreds of people cheering and we all went "What?!" and the Uber driver went "What?!?"
Taliesin: I think his exact words is, "Is this for us?" (all laugh)
Matt: And even we were like "I don't know."
Laura: I don't know!
Matt: You guys were amazing. Thank you for that.
Marisha: I feel like we need to find and screen cap in the thread where we were like, 20, 30 people, guys. Let's not get our hopes up.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Well, that's who got back to me, was like, I don't know, 40ish.
Laura: Yeah, we thought it was gonna be like 40 people.
Matt: Yeah, that was a good turnout.
Laura: That-- pretty great. Was great. Pretty great.
Liam: It was pretty metal.
Taliesin: The internet went, nope.
Matt: Yeah. Other announcements  Coming up in I think the next couple weeks or so, the release of the Minecraft Story Mode.
Marisha: (whispers) Yeah.
Travis: (sings) Yeah.
Matt: Comes out on Xbox. Completely a fun show. We went to the Archlight Let's Play of it they did, which was really a lot of fun. I play the characters Aiden and Otis in it.
Marisha: Hundreds of screaming children. Screaming, yeah.
Matt: Yes, lots of screaming children. Yeah, so I play Aiden and Otis and a smattering of other characters throughout. I think Sam also worked on it. Anyone else?
All: Ashley.
Matt: That's right, Ashley Johnson, our very own Pike!
Liam: She's one of the mains.
Matt: Yeah, she's one of the main characters in that show. So if you're a Minecraft fan and you like Telltale and you have an Xbox, check it out.
Laura: Speaking of Telltale, the final episode of Tales from the Borderlands comes out next week.
Travis: Oh snap!
Laura: Episode five, what!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Matt: Awesome!
Laura: Exciting.
Matt: (sings) Yeah.
Taliesin: Also in that role, if any Critters are in the Galveston area for Halloween, I will be at OniCon over Halloween weekend. So, you can come say hi in beautiful Galveston by the sea. Galveston, Texas.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: I'll be wearing a costume. It'll be great.
Matt: Perfect.
Liam: We have a gnome.
Laura: We have a gnome.
Taliesin: We have gnome? Oh god!
Marisha: You're in Minecraft, right? Story mode.
Sam: Yes I am.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: In fact you and I--
Matt: I think we have a couple scenes together.
Sam: We do something together, I don't know what. Or you're playing a version of me or something, I don't remember.
Matt: I can only assume that it's tawdry.
Sam: (laughs) The director told me something about you and I just assume we're probably having sex in the game.
Matt: Probably.
Sam: Yeah, okay.
Matt: It's just like an extended, fully interactive too. Talk about choices you make that affect the storyline. (laughs)
Taliesin: I blank out in the booth any time they mention his name.
Matt: But yeah, cool, guys. Any announcements anyone want to talk about, or shall we get things started?
Laura: Let's do it!
Matt: All right, let's do it.
Marisha: Do it!
Liam: Wait, where did Grog go?
Taliesin: Wait, wait, wait.
Sam: He'll be here.
Matt: Grog, he'll be here in a minute but in the meantime, let's go ahead and dial in for the next episode of Critical Role.
Taliesin: Dun dun dun dun. [opening credits]
Matt: Welcome back. So. Sh. (laughs) So, to go over the current adventure in its current sequence, we have-- the party recently had an encounter with the Briarwoods. Two individuals that were responsible for a lot of strife--
Liam: Dicks!
Matt: -- in the background of Percival's history. Seemingly responsible for the destruction of his entire family, and have for the past five years been essentially ruling his home city and castle. They were out for a political banquet with Sovereign Uriel in Emon and the party members of Vox Machina, they were all invited to be part of this. Didn't quite go as planned. There was a scuffle and the Briarwoods absconded back to Whitestone. They sent a couple assassins out to attempt to take out their driver, who was spilling information and essentially was going to be Vox Machina's way of being free of any sort of political issues based on their actions that evening, and after much discussion and preparation and purchasing a lot of mirrors, the party took their transit over to the east-northeast towards Whitestone, where they began to traverse the Alabaster Sierras to the north, using the mountain range as opposed to going directly through the forest. There they managed to avoid encountering a bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating the horses they left behind.
Travis: Damn.
Matt: They camped for the evening and began to make their way through some sort of a mountainous valley that led in towards the forest surrounding Whitestone. While they were traveling down this pass, there was a rumbling, and some sort of really fast, rapid-moving large blue creature that leaped down in front, catching them off-guard. And that is where we begin today.
Travis: Probably should have fucking researched that creature.
Taliesin: Did the creature look like that?
Matt: That blue creature.
Laura: Yeah, right? That would have been smart.
Taliesin: Okay, just checking.
Travis: I never do that.
Laura: I know. So dumb.
Sam: What's dumb?
Travis: I have a question.
Laura: That we didn't research that creature.
Travis: What did you roll on your beard check?
Matt: What'd I roll on my beard check?
Laura: I know, it's growing!
Marisha: It's metagaming, you can't. We're not allowed.
Matt: Well, obviously. (all laugh)
Matt: Well, No Shave 'Til 10k.
Travis: That's true!
Matt: And my Halloween costume requires a decent amount of facial hair.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right.
Travis: A sexy amount of facial hair, you beast! Be glad there's a table between you and I. (all laugh)
Liam: I was a little worried about some performance capture coming up, but it got moved back--
Laura: So you can shave--
Liam: Off to the races.
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: How far are we from 10K?
Travis: I gotta shave tonight.
Crew: 509.
Matt: 509 away.
Laura: All right.
Sam: So, like, tomorrow.
Marisha: Yeah, no.
Matt: We'll see.
Marisha: Tonight.
Matt: All right, so, everyone. As this huge, blue-scaled reptilian-like creature with multiple arms and legs comes skittering down the side of the cliffs, blocking off the entirety of this passage, snarling at you with sharp teeth and this sparking-blue electrical energy jutting out of the corners of its mouth. I want you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: So soon! Which one?
Sam: I add 20 to this, right, that's how it works?
Marisha: Not good.
Laura: Oh no!
Sam: See you guys in--
Marisha: Always cocked!
Travis: I didn't level up! What a dick.
Marisha: Still not great.
Liam: Wait, you did but you didn't, is what you're saying?
Travis: I did, but I didn't.
Liam: Add some hit points!
Laura: Yeah, add your points right now.
Liam: Add some hit points!
Travis: How many do I add?
Marisha: It's like--
Matt: 1d12 plus your constitution modifier!
Laura: 1d12!
Marisha: Barbarian, man!
Liam: Hey, we play D&D!
Laura: Hey, that's good! Plus--
Liam: Plus--
Laura: Whoa! 16 extra health points!
Matt: Whoa, what'd you roll?!
Laura: He rolled an 11 plus five!
Liam: Dang!
Marisha: That's hot.
Matt: That's pretty hot. So many hit points for the barbarian.
Liam: And, if you want, you can just boost to, are you at 12 now?
Travis: What?
Liam: Level 12? Are you at level 12?
Laura: Don't complicate things.
Liam: Just smash, smash, Hulk smash.
Sam: How many spells does he get?
Matt: All of them. All right, so initiatives we have-- 25 to 20, anyone?
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: All right. 20 to 15?
Laura: 19.
Travis: Me too. 16.
Matt: 16? 15 to ten?
Marisha: Ten.
Matt: Ten, Keyleth. Ten to five?
Liam: Eight! I consistently botch this roll.
Sam: See you guys in like an hour. I got a four.
Matt: Scanlan, you have consistently the best initiative rolls.
Sam: Oh, yeah. I save it for when it counts.
Matt: As you should, as you should. So, first up Percy. Instinctively, with your drive towards Whitestone and this creature in your way, you are already ready for this encounter. What are you going to do?
Taliesin: It's bigger than sin, isn't it?
Matt: It is considered a huge creature.
Taliesin: Okay, so, I'm going to alert everybody, get down! And I'm going to take three shots--
Sam: You're just going to start shooting.
Taliesin: Hmm?
Sam: You're just going to start shooting.
Taliesin: I'm just going to-- look at that thing!!
Marisha: Hey, Percy gonna do what Percy gonna do.
Sam: What if you could reason with him?
Laura: He is definitely--
Taliesin: Why doesn't it reason with me, is what I'm asking! It could reason with me!
Liam: There's a lot of heads in the way. Just aim true.
Taliesin: I'm aiming, I'm going to use the Sharpshooter for extra damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Three pepperbox shots.
Liam: I will be less handsome with one ear, I'm just saying.
Matt: With the minus five.
Taliesin: Yeah, so that's 17.
Matt: 17 hits. Just go ahead and roll the attacks in succession.
Taliesin: Hmm?
Matt: Go ahead and roll the attacks in succession so we know how many hit.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Second shot.
Taliesin: Second one, it hits, 18 plus seven.
Matt: It hits. Third one?
Taliesin: For the third one, I'm going to go for a head shot instead of a Sharpshooter.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And that's 21.
Matt: Okay, all three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: The dark cloud aids his rolls.
Laura: (whispers) Vengeance!
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17 damage.
Laura: (whispers) Vengeance!
Taliesin: Better!
Travis: Vengeance!
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: All righty!
Taliesin: That went really well. The last one-- do I do any damage when I hit the head? Normal damage. So, last one is seven points of damage plus he's got--
Matt: Disadvantage on his attacks this round.
Taliesin: Yeah, disadvantage on attacks.
Matt: Gotcha. Do you want to stay where you are, or are you going to move?
Taliesin: Am I touching a wall?
Matt: You're right close to one. You can--
Laura: Stop touching me. Stop touching me.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to brace against a wall.
Matt: Okay. Brace against that wall, there. Gotcha.
Taliesin: And I'm going to mark all this off.
Matt: All righty. Okay. Next up is the creature.
Laura: Argh.
Matt: (Laughs) Because it rolled really high on its initiative. It's going to go ahead. Let's see, at a movement of 50 feet.
Liam: Oh god.
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: (whispers) Are we in a valley? Or are we--
Laura: We're in a freaking--
Marisha: We're in a death trap.
Liam: It crawled down the wall.
Sam: No, it's going to be fine, guys. We're like a--
Taliesin: We're outdoors.
Sam: The valley is like a taco shell.
Laura: Is it a valley, or is it like those are cliff sides and we could fall?
Matt: It's a valley. The cliff sides go up.
Sam: Yeah, it's like a taco shell and we're the meat.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: And we're-- Yeah. Yeah. (all laugh)
Matt: You could climb around it without a problem. But it's pretty sheer. You'd have to make climb checks if you want to--
Marisha: Yep, accurate.
Liam: We're in a tight spot.
Laura: Okay. Got it.
Liam: We're in a tight spot.
Marisha: Unless you're in Japan.
Matt: So it scurries forward--
Taliesin: Taco.
Matt: Lowers its jaw and rears its head back. As it does, you see its eyes flare with electrical energy and inside its mouth begins to glow with a brightish blue, white power.
Liam: Get down.
Matt: A bolt of electrical energy comes forward, hitting Grog, Vax, Scanlan, and Percy.
Travis: It's electrifying!
Laura: Electrified.
Matt: Well, let's see. Actually, no, it would move out to-- Hmm, that's only 20 feet, so to get maximum-- This, let's see.
Sam: Maybe it doesn't do math well.
Laura: Don't think about it, just go.
Sam: Maybe it doesn't know math well. Maybe it doesn't move right.
Laura: Don't calculate it, Matt. It's fine.
Matt: No, actually for optimal--
Laura: Fuck.
Matt: --optimal impact here, instead, it's going to go there.
Travis: I have to put my head in its mouth?
Matt: (laughs) Practically.
Liam: (laughs) Eh.
Matt: It will then do it on-- It would be Grog, Vex, and Trinket.
Sam: I approve of that.
Matt: I realized that its bolt is only 20 feet long. So, utilizing its optimal Lightning Bolt length, you guys were clustered together.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: All right, so I need you guys, you three, to roll a dexterity saving throw.
Taliesin: With advantage?
Laura: With advantage because I'm in the mountains?
Matt: You do it with advantage. It only affects attacks, not for saving throws.
Taliesin: Oh, that's right. This is a magic save.
Travis: 19.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: I probably should spend Grit.
Laura: 21.
Matt: All right. And Trinket?
Laura: Argh.
Liam: (Chewbacca sounds)
Laura: (growls) Eight. Yay.
Matt: He got an eight?
Laura: He got a eight.
Matt: Oof, okay. 33 points of lightning damage to both of you.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Wait, that means--
Matt: Trinket takes 66.
Sam: 66?
Laura: Trinket's fucking dead, yo.
Sam: What?!
Matt: Unconscious.
Laura: That fast?!
Travis: Which one  dead or unconscious?
Laura: He's unconscious.
Taliesin: Unconscious.
Travis: Don't throw around the "D" word, unless it's the "D" word time.
Matt: So, as there was a crackling of energy forward, you two brace yourself, managing to get mostly out of the way. Unfortunately, both of you dodging out of the way leaves an open shot for bear, that just takes the brunt of it, throwing Trinket up against the side of the actual mountainous cavern. And slumps to the ground, smoking off the fur.
Laura: Does Trinket have to make saving throws?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Death saving throws? Yes.
Marisha: No one has any resistance, spell resistance?
Matt: Not yet. Until we get to his turn. That will end--
Laura: Ooh, ooh, wait.
Marisha: Forgetting-- Your armor? I've got a spell you're--
Laura: He's only got 42 hit points.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Technically, he should have more from leveling up. But, even more wouldn't be that much higher, so-- Okay, so that's rough. That ends its turn. Vex, you're up first. (all laugh)
Travis: She would like to rage.
Marisha: (as Matt) So that sucks, but--
Laura: Vengeance! Vengeance.
Taliesin: Say your soul is forfeit.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then I'm going to-- Why is he closer now? Sorry, Grog. I'm going to Hail of Thorns him.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Grog is always in the way.
Laura: Yeah, well--
Travis: I do need a good back tickle.
Liam: (as Grog) Got an itch back there.
Travis: Yeah. (laughs)
Laura: 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Laura: No, wait, that's wrong. No, 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Laura: (sighs) I'm so angry right now! Thorn's d--
Travis: It's not at me for once.
Laura: Ten. (sighs) 3d10.
Taliesin: For once, you're not the one doing damage to the bear.
Travis: That's good.
Laura: 18 plus two is 20.
Marisha: It's a bonus action, so we can do other shit if Scanlan and I both do it.
Laura: What is that?
Travis: 22.
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22 also hits.
Laura: No, that's the attack.
Matt: That's the damage. Okay, gotcha. And Grog, also--
Laura: Oh, yeah.
Matt: Because you're right next to it.
Travis: (posh accent) Would that be considered piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage?
Matt: (posh accent) It doesn't matter, you have not taken your turn to rage yet.
Travis: (posh accent) Oh fucking shit. (all laugh)
Matt: That would be full damage upon you, Grog.
Travis: Ow! (laughs)
Laura: Oh shit, I'm sorry. The other one was 27.
Matt: To hit? Okay.
Laura: Awoo. Ten plus--
Sam: Angry d10.
Laura: Plus 15.
Matt: 15. That's including the Hunter's Mark, right?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All right, good.
Laura: Oh wait, no, I wasn't adding the seven. Wait no, that's a lie. That's a 15, 16, 17, plus five. 21.
Matt: 21, got it. So, as you look over and you see Trinket on the ground, smoldering spire of smoke pouring off of his body--
Laura: Can I pull him? Can I pull him out of the way?
Marisha: Smells like burnt fur.
Sam: Burnt fur.
Laura: Just pull him into the little crevice, for my move.
Matt: This way, do you mean?
Laura: For my move. Is that a move action, or would it be an action-action?
Matt: That would be more of an action-action, unfortunately.
Laura: Ugh. Oh no.
Matt: But you angrily turn around, release your arrow, firing a completely furious Hail of Thorns into the creature. As it hits, it shatters across its hide, some of it scattering onto Grog. You don't even care. You just focus the anger, pull out a second arrow, unleash this one. Actually jamming underneath one of the scales. You can see a little trickle of dark, deep purple blood beginning to pour from the wound.
Laura: I get out of the line.
Matt: Okay, where do you want to go?
Laura: Towards the little crevice.
Matt: Right there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Did we lose--
Laura: But I still want to be near Trinket.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Getting ass-lit up with the Hail of Thorns, I go into a rage.
Laura: I'm so sorry.
Matt: (laughs) Okay.
Travis: I go into a Frenzied Rage!
Matt: All righty.
Travis: And I would like to attack three times with my flaming warhammer.
Matt: Certainly.
Liam: No more shopping today.
Travis: That is 24.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 21?
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Eee! 26.
Matt: That also hits.
Travis: Nice. Those were really good rolls. Okay. First one is 11.
Laura: I think I missed a box.
Travis: 13? First one.
Matt: 13 damage. Good to know.
Taliesin: Brought another sign.
Travis: 14 for the second one.
Marisha: (laughs) Yeah.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Travis: Yes. 17 and 18, 19, 20, 21 plus the fire damage.
Matt: Good to know.
Travis: Including fire damage.
Matt: All right, so, going into the rage, you just see that same fury. You can smell the burnt hair in the air and you use that to fuel that moment of pain. You just (impact sounds) and just start bludgeoning the creature right up in its face. You can see it's thrashing and snarling at you and snapping with each blow. You guys are locked in this titan-versus-human battle right now. Cool, and are you going to stay where you are?
Travis: I'm going to move. Can I move towards you a little bit?
Matt: This way, there?
Travis: Yes, staying next to him, but just out of the way of other projectiles that might be coming up my butthole.
Matt: Fair enough. (laughs) Okay, Grog. Ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I'm right next to Trinket, right?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Marisha: Okay, right? Where is Trinket?
Matt: Trinket's right there. You're over here.
Liam: Follow the smell.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and go to Trinket.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Oh, that's right. Make a death saving throw, by the way.
Sam: Oh, snap.
Matt: Almost forgot.
Laura: (whimpers) Oh no.
Matt: Roll a d20.
Liam: (sings) Roll high.
Marisha: He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
Taliesin: Roll like your bear depends on it.
Travis: You should pick a blood-colored one.
Laura: Why would you do that? He rolled a 19.
Sam: Ooh.
Matt: Okay, so not creeping closer to death yet.
Laura: Don't say that.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and do a Cure Wounds spell on him.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Thank you, Keyleth.
Marisha: I'll just do first level.
Sam: Oh. Trinket's not worth second level?
Marisha: No no no no no. I'll give him a-- shut up, Scanlan. (all laugh)
Liam: Wake him up, wake him up, wake him up.
Marisha: I instantly felt guilty, dick.
Taliesin: You guilted her up to another level.
Marisha: Yeah, you did. Okay.
Travis: (laughs) That was the best.
Sam: I would've done a cantrip.
Marisha: (laughs) That's 2d8 plus ten.
Travis: Dick.
Laura: 2d8 plus ten? That's great. (all laugh)
Travis: Guilted it for an imaginary bear.
Marisha: All right, that's pretty good.
Taliesin: That's not bad.
Marisha: That's an eight and a seven plus ten. So--
Matt: 25.
Sam: 25.
Marisha: 25.
Laura: 25!
Matt: So Trinket's at 25 hit points, conscious.
Laura: That's great!
Matt: Prone, but conscious.
Laura: He licks her.
Matt: You hear the-- okay. (laughs)
Marisha: And then, as a bonus action--
Taliesin: Ack.
Matt: Mm-hm?
Marisha: Can I, looking at whatever the shit this is, pull out my spark stone--
Laura: (gasps)
Marisha: --that I got from my Fire Ashari.
Sam: That's a thing? Oooh.
Matt: Uh-huh.
Marisha: And (shattering sound).
Sam: (gasps)
Taliesin: Oh, wow! We're going there.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Is that, like, "Break glass in case of emergency"?
Marisha: Yeah, I don't know what it does.
Sam: (laughs) Oh, great!
Travis: We'll find out.
Sam: Hope I'm right next to you.
Matt: After you finish healing Trinket--
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: -- you pull up, reach out, and pull this. And you're going to hold it in your hands, you could feel it's warm to the touch. Almost too hot to hold. And there's this slight pulsing, almost like a heartbeat pulse to it. You hold it in your hands and just crush it, concentrating all your energy on it. As you do, what seemed to be hard and sturdy all of a sudden turns brittle in your fingers, and it cracks and breaks, almost like it was made of a very, very brittle earth. As it breaks and your hands come together, the "too hot to touch" becomes too hot to touch, and for a moment, your hands burst into flames--
Sam: Ah.
Matt: And you instinctively pull back like you want to go ahead and put out the fire--
Marisha: Ow!
Matt: -- but then it falls to a normal temperature again, but the flames remain.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: And you can now see your hands are now emitting flame from all the fingers.
Sam: Woo.
Laura: Is that permanent?
Sam: What does it do?
Marisha: We'll find out. And I go Minxie.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Yeah, Minxie! (all cheer)
Marisha: And I brought the hood. (all laugh)
Sam: Too hot to handle, too cold to hold.
Liam: That tiger's on fire!
Travis: They in control.
Matt: Keyleth transforms into Minxie! And as Minxie--
Travis: Bobby Brown.
Matt: -- appears, her form transitioning into this large, albino sabre-toothed tiger--
Sam: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control.
Taliesin: (sing) Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control.
Matt: You can see both of the tiger's claws embedded into the ground of this rocky terrain are having licks of fire and flame curling off of the actual claws.
Marisha: Hell, yeah. I look like an Ed Hardy tattoo. (all laugh)
Matt: (laughs) I regret everything! (all laugh)
Matt: All right. That's your turn. Are you going to move, are you going to stay there?
Marisha: Well, I moved to Trinket.
Matt: Right, but you can break your movement up.
Marisha: Oh, yeah.
Matt: You've moved 20 feet, so you still have ten more feet to move if you want to.
Marisha: I'll start heading to try and flank him. To flank the blue beastie.
Matt: That should be there. Okay. All right, that ends Keyleth. Now would be Tiberius. Tiberius, who now takes the turn to cast Stoneskin on himself. Then backs up behind this side, there, preparing for the next round. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, Vax drops low. I click the boots of haste together, and for everyone who keeps asking, if I click my boots of haste together, I then get to attack three times. I get that question about three times a week. So that's how I do it. So, I click the boots of haste together, and then I'm going to crouch low and scoot. No, the other side of Minxie, and I should be able to go 60 feet without a problem all the way past the fucker.
Matt: Mm-hm?
Liam: Yeah, keep going, as far as I can. That's as far as I can go?
Matt: Yep.
Liam: All right. And I guess I will just dagger him in the ass, then.
Matt: All right.
Liam: So-- First is a--
Taliesin: I love that die.
Liam: Two, three, 24?
Matt: 24 hits.
Liam: Yes. And this would be Sneak Attack--
Matt: This is with Sneak Attack, yep.
Liam: Because he's with Grog.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Yeah!
Liam: So, here's the damage for the attack. Ooh. Two, seven, is nine, plus-- Ooh.
Laura: Ooh, oh no.
Liam: This is 13, 17, 19, 20, 26, 31 for the first.
Travis: Jesus.
Liam: Second attack go. Oh, that's not the right die at all. Second attack goes. Same. Eee, 23?
Matt: All right, that hits.
Liam: Okay. And this is--
Matt: Regular damage now.
Liam: Yeah yeah yeah. That's seven?
Matt: Seven, all righty.
Liam: And then the last dagger, the keen dagger, stabs him in the butt again, and that is--
Laura: Ow.
Liam: Ow, 16.
Matt: 16. That does not hit.
Liam: Whiff!
Matt: You actually go with a third one. The first one stabs through, and you can see you've actually hit some sort of an internal organ as you pull back and starts gouting blood. You see that, you stab a second blade in the same area and tend to open the wound another inch, inch and a half. The third one, you pull back, but it slinks around over its shoulder, its long sinewy neck curling over and staring at you. And your blade catches the hide instead and streaks off of the scales.
Liam: Oh, hi.
Matt: That'll end your turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Do I have to heal Trinket anymore?
Laura: No, he's okay.
Sam: Okay. Then I will-- (laughs) Let's see here. Do we want to get him away from us, or do we want to hurt him? Let's do--
Laura: We want to hurt him!
Sam: Well, I don't hurt things very well. (laughs)
Travis: Do what you're going to do.
Laura: Do what you do.
Taliesin: You hurt feelings.
Marisha: You do you, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. I'll do some Bigby Hand.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I summon Bigby's Hand. (sings) Bigby's Hand! (all laugh)
Matt: This giant spectral hand, sparkling arcane energy appears roughly in front of your space.
Sam: It's in front of me. I can't make it go in front of him?
Matt: You can.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Like, I'm just saying, from a flavor standpoint.
Sam: Okay. Well then, I do one of these, the Sugar Ray Leonard. I do this-- (all laugh)
Sam: And then I throw my other hand forward. (all laugh)
Sam: And I'll just punch him in the face.
Matt: Go for it. (all laugh)
Matt: I like that.
Sam: Right? Because I can do the-- It says huge or smaller creature, at least with Grasping Hand. Is that only-- does that count?
Matt: Right. Oh. You can just punch something with it, no matter its size, to do damage.
Sam: So the Clenched Fisht, Clenched Fist.
Matt: Correct. Correct.
Laura: Clenched Fisht.
Matt: Clenched Fisht.
Sam: Clenched Fisht attack, Money Penny.
Matt: Thish ish the one you're talking about. Yes. All right, so-- For the Clenched Fist, make a melee spell attack. So roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Sam: (laughs) Nope. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: 13.
Matt: 13. As the fist swings out, it ducks out of the way. Its serpentine body ducking as the fist arcs off into the middle of the air.
Marisha: Oh.
Matt: Spinning around, preparing itself for a secondary round, hopefully.
Laura: Good try, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh boy. (laughs)
Matt: That's good.
Liam: Vax sees it fly over his head, and watches it pass. (all laugh)
Sam: I'll take a step to my left, so I'm not in the same line of fire as Percy.
Matt: All right.
Sam: And I'll also inspire Grog. (sings) He's Grog, he's Grog, he's big, he's strong, like wood. He's better than bad, he's good. (all laugh)
Laura: That's awesome.
Matt: (sings) Everyone wants a Grog.
Travis: That's amazing. Is that a ten? That's a ten?
Matt: d10, yeah.
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: d10 Inspiration die from the bard.
Travis: Thank you, Scanlan.
Matt: Top of the round again. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to scoot a little bit forward, just into that little crevice. I'm going to take three more shots, just to see what I can do.
Matt: Okay. You have the Sharpshooter feat, right?
Taliesin: With the Sharpshooter feat.
Matt: Okay, so yeah. Because it would have partial cover right now, but you ignore that with the--
Taliesin: I have Sharpshooter, so I can ignore cover.
Matt: Good to know.
Taliesin: Yeah, so. But I'm going to be taking a negative for these hits. Still three attacks per--
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. Just making sure I'm doing this right.
Matt: But you have to reload after this turn.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Oh no.
Travis: Misfire?
Taliesin: Misfire. (all groan)
Matt: First shot. As you pull up to the side, you pull your pepperbox out and go to fire. As you do, you pull the trigger and the actual barrel sticks out the side. Spins off, and (ping-ping-ping) on the ground.
Travis: Fuck.
Matt: So that's your attack.
Marisha: Balls.
Matt: That's your turn because it'll take you the rest of the turn to collect the Bad News.
Sam: Just say, "Your soul is forfeit," just for coolness. (all laugh)
Taliesin: This normally doesn't happen to me. I don't quite know what-- (all laugh)
Travis: It happens to all guys sometimes. (all laugh)
Taliesin: So can I, at least, use my bonus to pick up the pieces and--
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to pick up the pieces and--
Matt: You collect Pepperbox and you pull your back up to it and mutter curses.
Laura: Oh no.
Liam: Make sure you grab your dignity as well.
Taliesin: I'm just going to leave that as an open target for a little while.
Matt: Fair enough. Okay. Now, on its turn--
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: First off, let's see here.
Liam: Damn it, attack attack!
Sam: We did great. (laughs)
Matt: But that does not recharge its Lightning Breath. It's going to move here. It's going to go ahead and make two attacks. It's going to turn around and its head that's looking at you, now, after you stabbed it in the back.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Reaches down, its giant jaws open. You can see, like, this thick saliva that's coating its fangs, and it, with serpentine speed, bites at you.
Liam: Hey, rogue's Evasion.
Matt: That's going to be a 23 to hit.
Liam: So, Uncanny Dodge, I can dodge for half damage, so it was a what to hit?
Matt: 23.
Liam: 23 hits, but I take half damage.
Matt: All right.
Laura: (as Vax) Half damage.
Matt: So, let's see. That would be--
Liam: Yesh.
Marisha: Does a bite attack--
Liam: Half. Not whole.
Laura: (as Vax) Half damage.
Liam: 152 hit points.
Travis: Stop rolling, Jesus.
Matt: (laughs) It would be 26 damage, so you take 13.
Liam: Ah, nothing.
Laura: Okay, okay.
Taliesin: Ain't nothing.
Laura: Don't say that's nothing.
Matt: Points of piercing damage.
Laura: Don't say that's nothing.
Matt: And then, as it bites, it turns around and its tail begins to snake around your body, Grog.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: And its whole body begins to try to reach around to constrict and crush you.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: What?
Matt: That is a 21 to hit.
Travis: That hits.
Matt: All righty, so. You take 21 points in bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Halved.
Matt: So that'd be 11 points of bludgeoning damage plus 21 points of slashing damage.
Sam: Whoa.
Travis: Halved.
Matt: As well. So a total of 22 damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And you are considered grappled and restrained, currently, as the entire creature begins to wrap around you. And you're currently (sound of struggle). You're trying to hold onto your axe but your whole body's being crushed by this large serpentine creature. (all laugh)
Travis: You piece of shit.
Matt: You feel every pulse of its muscles tensing. As the pain and ache, you can feel muscles and ligaments tearing and popping as it pulls in on you.
Travis: Not cool.
Matt: And it's going to, as part of its grapple, move you with it to there. And it'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. How does the Hide thing work? Do I hide at the beginning of the turn or at the end of the turn?
Matt: At the end of the turn.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to move out.
Matt: Okay, it has a reach of ten. So you are technically within its melee range. So you can run but you'll take attack of opportunity from it if you do. Just so you're aware.
Laura: Can I still arrow it from where I am?
Matt: You can, but you have disadvantage on all your ranged attacks because you are in melee range.
Laura: Does it cancel out because I'm in the mountains?
Matt: Doesn't affect your attacks.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: Sorry. It's up to you, you can stay where you are and take disadvantage on all your attacks, or you could run past and it gets a free swipe on you. Your call.
Laura: I'm going to try to back up.
Matt: Okay. Over to here? Like, how far?
Laura: Oh no. Wait, I can't see. I forgot my glasses.
Matt: Okay, you're right here.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: You can try and back up this way if you wanted to get away.
Laura: Yeah, I'll try to back up towards, who is that?
Matt: That's Scanlan there. Oh, here?
Laura: Percy? I'll try to back towards Percy.
Matt: Right there?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Over here?
Laura: Sure, yeah. Why not?
Matt: Okay, all right.
Sam: What's Trinket doing?
Laura: Well, Trinket's healed, and he's going to come with me.
Matt: Okay. So Trinket gets up and used half its 40 movement. It can move--
Laura: Although he's angry about it, because he wants to fight, but I just won't let him right now.
Matt: Okay, so as you rush away, the creature takes-- Ooh, that's a 26 to hit.
Laura: Aw, Jesus. Really?
Sam: Oh shit, does it hit Trinket, too?
Laura: No, just me.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: Trinket was too far away.
Matt: So you take 18 points of piercing damage. Oh, it's 3d10, sorry.
Laura: Oh. (laughs)
Matt: 19. I rolled a one for damage.
Laura: Oh, yay!
Matt: 19 points of piercing damage as its mouth lashes out, takes a chunk of your shoulder for a second, and you wrench yourself away and keep running.
Laura: Ugh.
Matt: Take the rest of your turn.
Laura: Ugh, okay. I'm going to shoot him.
Matt: Yes, you are.
Laura: Okay. That is 22.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Okay. 14 for the first hit.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Second one is through the blazing bow, at 22.
Matt: Second one hits, first one misses, or did it hit?
Laura: Oh no, 14 was the damage to it.
Matt: For damage? All right, second one, blazing bow?
Laura: And then, (noises).
Sam: (noises)
Laura: (noises) Ugh. 16.
Matt: 16 damage, all right. Okay.
Laura: Oh, and I hide.
Matt: You currently are completely in its visual range. You have to be behind something to reasonably become hidden.
Laura: I'm hiding behind--
Taliesin: But you are behind me.
Laura: Percy.
Matt: No, behind a person doesn't work. It has to be, like, behind a pillar.
Marisha: Human shield.
Matt: Or in deep shadow.
Laura: (groans) Oh.
Matt: Something that would break your line of sight to it--
Travis: Like me.
Matt: For a moment, to the point where it no longer knows quite where you are.
Marisha: It works.
Taliesin: It totally works.
Laura: I hid in the wrong place.
Sam: Who said that? Who said that?
Laura: I went to the wrong place.
Matt: But now you know.
Laura: It's okay. Next time I know.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Putting glass for the dog--
Matt: That's your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to try and break the grapple.
Matt: All right.
Travis: 20.
Matt: 20, yes.
Marisha: I can picture that. Why did you do that?
Matt: Because you are restrained--
Taliesin: Kicking myself.
Matt: Need to check what effect the condition-- Here. Just to be safe. Okay, yeah. Go ahead and you're making an athletics check.
Travis: Natural 20. (all cheer)
Travis: Oh, that was good.
Matt: All right, so--
Travis: I bite its tail.
Marisha: Yeah. (all laugh)
Laura: You can.
Travis: Son of a bitch! Ahhh!
Matt: As your teeth sink into one of its scales and you yank it out with the sheer force of your muscly neck.
Laura: Throw it over my way. I'll catch it.
Matt: It unfurls for a second, you manage to pull yourself out of its grasp.
Travis: I'm so pissed that I broke free, that I would like to use Intimidating Presence on this creature.
Matt: Okay. All right. That is an action to do that, though, isn't it?
Travis: Is it?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Yeah.
Travis: I reserve Intimidating Presence--
Matt: For a later time.
Travis: (laughs) -- for a later time.
Matt: But you have a bonus action, still.
Travis: I hit the shit out of it. (all laugh)
Matt: You gain another attack, go for it.
Travis: Okay, 21.
Matt: 21 does hit.
Travis: All right, that's 22. 22! Sorry, 22 hits?
Matt: Also hits. One more.
Travis: Oh, I get one more.
Laura: Ha ha! Also 22.
Travis: Also 22.
Matt: "Hit" meaning--
Sam: You hit once.
Matt: It was one better than your previous--
Travis: Oh, got you.
Matt: You hit once, yeah.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Just one hit.
Matt: Just one hit.
Sam: Just keep rolling 22s.
Laura: Just keep rolling.
Travis: Nine, ten, 11, 12. 15.
Matt: 15 points.
Travis: With fire damage!
Matt: All right, so, as you pull away, you reach back with your hammer and slam it into its side, causing this giant burst of fire--
Travis: Bitch.
Matt: To emanate from the impact. It shrinks back for a second and (growls).
Travis: You grabbed me. You ask first.
Taliesin: This is a repair die.
Matt: (laughs) All right, Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm going to do my Bite and Claw attacks.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to move in that crux a little bit more, one more, if I can?
Matt: There? All righty.
Marisha: Beautiful. I'm going to do my claw attacks first.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: To see what they-- what it does.
Matt: What was it?
Marisha: It was cocked.
Sam: It was halfway between two.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: So that's 12, plus, it's always different. Okay, 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: I haven't been Minxie in battle for a while, 1d10 plus five.
Laura: Plus your flaming claws.
Travis: (laughs) I love Minxie.
Laura: Don't forget your flaming claws.
Liam: She's got the plan.
Marisha: Yeah, six, so 11 damage for the claws.
Matt: An additional 1d6 fire damage.
Marisha: Plus 1d6, oh wait that's actually-- What did I just say? I said ten, 11? And then an extra 1d6?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Ooh, another four, so what did I say?
Sam: 15.
Matt: So, any of your claw attacks or any claw attacks you do in any of your forms now get an additional 1d6 fire damage.
Sam: Nice!
Travis: Hell yeah!
Sam: Nice!
Marisha: Then I'm going to do my bite attack.
Matt: All right, go for it. Your bite does not get the effect.
Laura: I know, it was really loud!
Travis: It was a good one.
Marisha: 16, so plus-- 20, plus my six, plus seven, so 24.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for the bite.
Marisha: Which is 2d6. Eight plus five, so 12.
Matt: Eight plus five is 13.
Marisha: 13, 14! Plus, I get an extra damage for my collar, so 14.
Matt: Right. Cool. So, your flaming claw strikes across its outer body, its legs pull away from the pain as you reach up and bite into the edge of its tail. As its tail tries to whip away, you catch it and it pulls you forward a few feet as you clench down on it. Eventually, it yanks its way out, taking a couple of scales with it, you can see a streak where teeth marks are on the back of its tail.
Marisha: (growls)
Matt: Awesome. Does that end your turn?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Nice, Minxie!
Marisha: (growls)
Matt: Tiberius is going to go around the corner again and is going to cast Telekinesis and send his glaive up spinning.
Laura: Glaive?
Sam: He has a glaive?
Laura: The thing that he killed the old lady with.
Sam: Oh!
Liam: It's the granny grinder!
Marisha: Granny grinder?!
Matt: Granny grinder?!
Travis: So bad.
Matt: Rolls a two, unfortunately, though. Just streaks off and spins back around and then, while it misses the creature and stops, hovering above his head with a slow spin. Sits there curling his fingers, grinning at the creature. And is going to the use of the rest of this movement to go back behind the rock because mama didn't raise no fool. Vax, you're up.
Liam: It's preoccupied, so I just leisurely walk backwards about 30 feet, looking at the same wound that I started before.
Matt: This way?
Liam: No, back up the chasm here. Even further away. Yeah! And I'm just going to throw three daggers into the wound I already hit, so I'm going to do that again. I know that hits because it hit the last time. That's a 23.
Matt: That hits!
Liam: And that's Sneak Attack because he's occupied. That's 11 plus--
Laura: Ooh, those are good!
Liam: 11 plus 17, 21, 26, 29, 34, 39 for the first dagger.
Sam: What, that's just the first dagger?!
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: Whoa!
Matt: Sneak Attack, man.
Liam: Next one doesn't hit, probably, that's a 17.
Matt: 17 just barely hits.
Liam: Just barely hits, yeah! That is an eight of damage. And just wait a second and go-- and throw it. And because I was such a cock it misses, that's a 16.
Matt: So, oh, perfect! Second dagger wedges in with the second dagger, opening the wound even more. You're like, perfect opening! You go for the third one, and it's grown wise to it, and turns around and rakes its claw out and deflects the dagger midair.
Liam: Vex, look at me! Oh, shit.
Laura: Nice one! Nice!
Matt: That brings us to Scanlan.
Sam: Oh! This is unusual.
Marisha: A turn.
Sam: I still have my Bigby's Hand up, so I do one of these where I say, oh, a wise guy, see? (taunting noises) and I just poke him in the eyes.
Matt: All right, as you say "Wise guy, eh?" as this giant hand's floating in the air, and its head snarls at it and tries to bite at the hand. Go ahead and roll your spell attack.
Sam: 19.
Matt: So, you get to go ahead and--
Sam: 4d8.
Matt: Yeah, 4d8 points of force damage.
Marisha: It's the eyes!
Laura: Into the eyeballs!
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19 points of force damage as you jam both its fingers into the sides of its head. Both of its eyes recoil on it, it reaches out and starts thrashing at the air around as the hand dodges around for a minute.
Sam: I hide behind Trinket, the smell of smoldering fur in my nose. As a bonus action, I will-- who's up next, who's coming soon? Is Percy next?
Taliesin: I'm up next.
Sam: I'll inspire Percy. Just doing this move--
Marisha: Sexy dance.
Sam: Going, pour some Scanlan on you! When you need a hand! That's all I've got.
Taliesin: Ugh!
Sam: And I get closer. Pour some Scanlan on you!
Matt: You begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice from Scanlan.
Travis: Is the creature blinded from the pokey-poke?
Matt: It is not. It is a resilient creature, and the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular sockets, as opposed to the eyes themselves.
Travis: Hey, I didn't ask for science. Jesus. (all laugh)
Matt: There's bone around-- never mind. All right. It ends Scanlan's turn. Percy, you're up.
Travis: (laughs) Just a little pokey.
Taliesin: All right. I'm going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa.
Sam: Do I lose another spell for that, or is that just the same--?
Matt: No, you can maintain concentration.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: I hit a 12, which is just barely enough to fix it.
Matt: Okay. So you take your action to go ahead and repair the gun.
Taliesin: And I'm going to burn an Action Surge, so I'm just-- I finally get it, and it just starts going. And I'm just going to empty out the chamber.
Matt: All right, three shots.
Marisha: (laughs) It just starts going.
Taliesin: Ho, nelly.
Matt: Using your bonus action to reload.
Travis: I got my finger on the trigger, I got my finger on the trigger, gun!
Taliesin: I don't have to reload, yet, I've got six shots, so we're still three in the chamber.
Matt: That's right. We-- yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Unless you, actually--
Matt: As part of the misfire, you would lose one, so you have two in the chamber right now.
Taliesin: I have two in the chamber?
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Okay, so I'll do two, and then use the third one to reload.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Pew, pew.
Laura: (high-pitched) Pew, pew.
Taliesin: All right, so-- Ooh, this'll be fun.
Sam: Don't shoot me.
Taliesin: Sharpshooter shot. That's 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Travis: Nice.
Taliesin: I'll just take the second shot right now. That's-- really? Really? Really, are we going there?
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Did he misfire again?
Marisha: No, you didn't misfire, did you?
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: Misfired again. I rolled a two.
Laura: No.
Taliesin: I got one shot off.
Matt: You got one shot off. Go ahead and roll damage. Sharpshooter damage, so it gets the plus ten damage.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Marisha: That's fun.
Laura: Could you have added inspiration dice to that?
Taliesin: To a misfire? No.
Matt: No, misfire still hits. There is a lot of strengths to the gunslinger. This is the one penalty, is if you roll bad.
Taliesin: So that's, okay, at least this is a badass, as I at least did some damage. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24 damage, plus four points of fire damage.
Matt: Nice. Okay. So, as you go, and you fix it-- It takes the first shot, with a burst of flame that shoots out the front of the barrel. The second shot, this time, the actual metal in the front arcs upward, and it looks like this is going to take a moment, to really seriously repair it. Pepperbox is coming through pretty rough in this fight.
Laura: Oh, no. Oh no.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Travis: But not as rough as Stitch over there, huh?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: We're in a group.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) The creature does regain use of its Lightning Breath.
Liam: Right.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: Oh, I was about to say, and--
Matt: So you wanna move anywhere?
Taliesin: Yeah, I wanna get a little further back. I wanna roll to the other side of the cave again, if possible.
Matt: Which way? You mean over here?
Taliesin: Yeah. Like, see that little outcropping of rock?
Matt: Right here?
Taliesin: Further back. Like that over there.
Marisha: That little chunky thing?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Smart move, Percy.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: That thing scares me.
Laura: Why are you abandoning me?
Matt: Okay. That ends Percy's turn.
Taliesin: The beast.
Marisha: I don't like the dice that I have.
Travis: Don't think too hard.
Taliesin: That's not good.
Sam: No.
Laura: It just burps out lightning.
Travis: Jesus, I don't think we've ever seen anything this hard.
Laura: I know.
Liam: Guys, guys.
Sam: What is he doing?
Liam: Guys.
Marisha: Have you seen anything like it?
Sam: What is he doing?
Liam: Guys.
Laura: He's thinking.
Liam: Guys.
Sam: We broke the DM.
Laura: I know.
Travis: You know the silence before the storm?
Matt: Considering optimal--
Laura: This is bad.
Liam: He erupts.
Travis: He hasn't said anything.
Matt: All right. So. (all groan)
Marisha: You stared at that for a really long time.
Sam: Here comes the other three.
Travis: Here comes the boom?
Matt: So, this behir is going to shift back here. You get an attack of opportunity on it, Keyleth. So go ahead and take a swing.
Liam: Burn it.
Sam: Fire slap!
Marisha: So. 16.
Matt: 16 just misses. It gets right out of your grasp. The flames just lick across the outside of its scales. As it pulls back, rears down right in your face, Godzilla-style, just unleashes a burst of electrical energy.
Laura: Oh, God. Dodge it. Dodge it.
Matt: It hits you and Keyleth. I need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws.
Sam: With inspiration.
Marisha: Who, me and Grog? Okay.
Sam: With inspiration.
Travis: I don't need it.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: Dexterity saves? That's not good.
Travis: 19.
Marisha: Four.
Matt: 33 points of lightning damage to you, Grog. 66 to you.
Travis: Can I use my Stone's Endurance?
Matt: You can.
Travis: Okay.
Taliesin: What?!
Matt: What's the maximum health of Minxie's form?
Marisha: Looking-- I'm out.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm now in Keyleth form.
Matt: And how much damage goes over?
Marisha: Not that many, thank God. 12.
Matt: 12. Okay, so you-- As Minxie all of a sudden gets blasted, you can see the form shrink down to Keyleth's crumpled form on the ground, hands still flaming, little bit of singe to the back of her hair, and stands back up.
Taliesin: I'll take that. I'll take that. (all laugh)
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: That'll end its turn. Vex, you're up.
Marisha: That felt like Shockwave.
Laura: Oh, God. Can I, as a bonus action, give Trinket a healing potion?
Matt: You can-- that would be more of an action to feed it to something else.
Laura: Okay, never mind. I am going to attack it.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay. He's, oh, I missed. That's a 14.
Matt: A 14 does not hit, unfortunately. The first arrow just ricochets and shatters across the part of its body.
Laura: Great. Good times, good times. 16. Both miss. Fucking A. What a waste.
Matt: Both arrows just explode across its hide. It's too thick.
Laura: This dice is out for the rest of the game. I'm gonna run. Is there an outcropping where we are? I can't see.
Matt: Right here, a little bit. If you pull fully in on this side from where it--
Laura: I'm going to pull fully in on that side.
Matt: Okay. Don't forget your laser pointers, by the way, guys. It's good for letting me know exactly where you want to go.
Laura: I can't see.
Matt: I know. Just so you know. And Trinket's going to stay there?
Laura: He's gonna rest. And he's going to keep protecting Scanlan, because--
Matt: All right. Trinket's gonna stay right there, guarding the giant gnome.
Sam: Oh, thank you. Giant gnome?
Matt: Giant hand, small gnome. Grog, you're up.
Travis: (yells) I try and match the Godzilla roar, it's not really as good, and I swing three times with my fire hammer.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: That's a 18.
Matt: 18. That hits.
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Travis: And 19.
Matt: 19 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Yeah, yeah.
Travis: That anus! That's 13.
Laura: Eee, good.
Travis: 23, and 22.
Matt: All righty. How do you want to do this? (all yell)
Taliesin: But you never said he looked a little rough! I kept waiting for you to say it's looking a little rough.
Matt: It's hard to tell with this entity.
Taliesin: Damn it!
Matt: It's moving so fast.
Travis: I'd like to reach up with my firebrand warhammer.
Sam: Yes!
Travis: And I would like to smash it on top of its skull, and when it hits the ground, I'd just like to keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet jams that I can bottle it up and sell later!
Matt: You guys watch this continuous barrage, this horrible bludgeoning. Every impact almost quakes the inside of this valley. Rocks are beginning to tumble and fall around it. And you can see, as each horrible, sickening smack, its head just collapses more and more. The mush begins to spill out from under it, this giant pool of, like, dark violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once the inside of its head, begin to just grow around it as Grog just keeps hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting--
Marisha: Grog? Grog?
Matt: And hitting and hitting--
Laura: Grog?
Sam: I use Bigby's Hand to stop the hammer.
Laura: Maybe you unrage. Lullaby, Hulk. Lullaby.
Sam: It's over. It's over.
Marisha: Lullaby?!
Travis: Lullaby?!
Sam: Think of the beard.
Travis: What happened?
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: You killed it real good!
Travis: Oh, look, we made jelly.
Marisha: Speaking of jelly, I would like to go ahead and do a nature check to see if I can salvage some goods from whatever.
Laura: I run, I walk up to it and kick it, and say, that's for Trinket. Dick.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Can I roll a hit dice to recover some--
Matt: If you guys want to take a short rest, you can.
Travis: Oh.
Laura: That'd be great.
Taliesin: Yes! I would like to fix my gun. Just a giant pile of tools.
Laura: Do we need to hide? Do we need to climb up to its little cave that it was in, maybe? And hide.
Sam: Did it have a cave?
Travis: Was it in a cave?
Laura: It had a cave. Didn't it come out of a cave, when we saw it?
Matt: You saw it was up on a higher platform, you didn't see a cavern, or anything.
Laura: Oh, I thought it was a cave.
Marisha: I rolled a 21 to collect goods.
Matt: Okay, looking through the book that you have. You eventually take a while to look while you guys are having your short rest. You can use your hit dice to heal yourself. It is known as a behir.
Sam: A behir?
Matt: B-E-H-I-R.
Marisha: B-E-H-I-R.
Taliesin: Behir.
Travis: Be here.
Laura: Be here right now. Be present.
Matt: Behir. There are two things. Anything in the face and teeth are gone. They are just mush. The entire head is destroyed.
Marisha: Sure.
Matt: The the two things in the book that are worthwhile, like, really worth money, are some of its hide can be repurposed for, you know, like, lightning resist-based armor, but currently it's unknown who has the speciality to actually work with that material. These creatures are difficult to harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown. A lot of them were hunted down for that long ago and almost thought to have gone extinct. (all groan)
Matt: However, yes, you don't know anybody, possibly Karin in Emon. The hide can be harvested. There is also a gland in its throat that it uses to charge its Lightning Breath.
Taliesin: I'd like that.
Marisha: I'd like that.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for the hide first, if you guys want to go for that.
Laura: Can I stealth and climb up and see if I can see a cavern?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: A little cave.
Marisha: Natural 20!
Travis: Oh snap!
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: I'll take it.
Sam: She gets advantage because mountains are her favorite terrain.
Laura: What do I add to that?
Matt: This would be, add your--
Laura: Acrobatics?
Matt: For climb, this would be athletics.
Laura: Athletics. Oh, really? That's not what it was; I moved it.
Liam: It was 14, I saw it.
Laura: Oh no, 12.
Matt: It takes you a little bit to get up there. It's steep, you slide down a few times. But eventually, because there's no immediate threat, you're given time to get up onto this upper platform. You can see that there are these various parts of the rock that jut outward, that have some short term passageways that this creature uses.
Laura: I'm so weak, but I'm holding to see if I see a cave.
Matt: (laughs) Roll a perception check.
Laura: (groans)
Matt: Once you're up there. You take time and with help from some other folks, you manage to harvest, I'd say about ten pounds worth of scales at most. It's not a whole lot. A lot of it has been torn and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys did. Parts of it are not really armory functional, but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set if somebody manages to work really well with it.
Marisha: Here, Grog, bag of holding.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23? Currently, you have no eye shot on any particular--
Sam: Don't eat it, Grog.
Matt: -- tunnels. Nothing that resembles an abode or a cavern from this position.
Taliesin: Lick it.
Laura: (groans)
Liam: I see my sister's struggling.
Laura: Oh god it hurts.
Liam: I climb up next to her.
Laura: You're almost as weak as I am, dude.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Here we go.
Liam: Acrobatics? What is it?
Matt: Athletics.
Laura: Athletics.
Travis: Athletics.
Liam: Athletics? Oh, shit. Acrobatics would have been much better.
Travis: Oh yeah, c'mon.
Laura: I know, I don't think so.
Liam: Can I flip up there?
Matt: Eh, it doesn't work like that.
Liam: No, no-- (all laugh)
Travis: No, I can't.
Liam: Wait, I'll use Luck. I'll do it again to get--
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: You're going to use one of your Lucks?
Liam: -- to get past that one.
Laura: No, we were about to rest. Wow.
Liam: Oh, no, I didn't.
Laura: Oh, really, you rolled worse than me.
Liam: Oh no, my fingernail, that really stings. Damn it.
Matt: The twins give a--
Marisha: Just terrible.
Matt: -- terrible display of rock climbing in the middle of this.
Travis: I laugh heartily.
Taliesin: Parkour! Parkour!
Matt: Go ahead and roll for the glands.
Marisha: The glands?
Liam: Stupid video game moment of like jump, jump, jump, jump.
Laura: Like Skyrim trying to get--
Marisha: Glands? 18 is not bad. I'll take that 18 for a 28. Hey, Vax, can I see your dagger?
Liam: Yeah, here you go.
Sam: He's up a hill.
Laura: Nice. We didn't even get up a little bit.
Matt: It takes most of your short rest. You will not be able to use your hit dice for healing on this, because you spend your time harvesting instead. But you manage to-- thankfully, the damage that Grog had inflicted upon its head destroyed most of its matter, right up to the throat gland which is mostly untouched. It's salvageable. You don't know how much it's worth. Probably a decent amount, as the book says that they're rare. Especially to find intact.
Travis: That Grog, what a dick.
Taliesin: We have jars. I'm going to put that into the jar and put it away.
Travis: There's not even like a tooth. Like one broken tooth? A piece?
Matt: You did a number on that one's face.
Travis: When Grog goes to work. LIAM Boom. Kill the behir, take its glands, money.
Taliesin: I may have something I can do with this actually.
Travis: With what, the gland?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Maybe, yes. (electricity noises)
Taliesin: You're very clever, yes. We'll work on that.
Travis: Hello? I don't speak your language.
Matt: You place it within a preservation jar.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Back in the bag of holding?
Taliesin: Back in the bag of holding.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to try and fix this mess, for a minute.
Matt: Go ahead and make your check.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18. It does cost you half the--
Taliesin: It wasn't a dual fail.
Matt: Oh right, just a single fail. It was a dual fail, but it was separate.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: You take some time with it during the short rest to tinker with it. You manage to bend the metal back in place. Test it for a bit. Make sure the aspects that move move smoothly as they should. Eventually, you get pretty confident that it is back to a functional piece of weaponry. All right, so, as you guys finish this rest--
Travis: I'm rolling one more hit dice.
Matt: Go for it. The sky is starting to get a little bit into the orangish color. Though you can not see the sun from its current location, you gather you have about an hour and a half or so before full sundown.
Sam: Let's get out of this little taco in case that was the daughter of something else.
Matt: Wait, you guys stayed the night-- never mind, in the cavern. So actually, no, I take that back.
Sam: Oh?
Matt: I just realized you guys stayed the night last time over on the seaside cavern and walked here--
Travis: That's right.
Matt: -- and it only took you a few hours to get here. So, no, it'd be about mid-day noon.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So, I take that back. Never mind.
Liam: Ah.
Sam: We should still go.
Matt: Can see the sun, it is straight above.
Taliesin: We should still get out of the taco.
Matt: There is some cloud cover coming in.
Travis: Definitely should still leave.
Matt: From the north side, it doesn't look like anything too dense.
Marisha: Percy?
Taliesin: Yes?
Marisha: Do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path?
Taliesin: Honestly, I've never taken this road before. This is further east than I've ever come.
Marisha: Can we see how far ahead-- does it look like it goes on for a while, this chasm?
Matt: It moves around, so it's hard to get to much of a visual of the--
Taliesin: The geology starting to look familiar?
Laura: Does my tracking tell me anything?
Matt: You can go ahead and make a nature check.
Liam: For all of this, I'd like to--
Matt: With advantage.
Liam: -- walk about 40 feet in front of everyone and creep along.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 17.
Liam: Cloak up.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Sam: He's a weird loner, that guy.
Travis: He is.
Liam: It's my job.
Matt: Make a stealth check. The mountains here got its name for the white stone mountains. The rock--
Taliesin: It's starting to look like home, though?
Matt: Yeah. The mountain range here is a large part of the material that is mined, well, was mined beneath the-- It's very rare white quartz-like rock that is used for many purposes. And it's generally only found in this mountain range. It's what a lot of the Whitestone's original economy was based on.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22, good to know. All right, so.
Laura: 17 on nature.
Matt: Okay. I mean, you gather the same thing. The rock formations here match the same as the coastal mountains. The mountain here is all made of the same material, few deposits here and there of just normal bits of granite and other forms of simple stone.
Laura: Granite.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Simple stone. (all laugh)
Travis: That was so much better than shopping. (all laugh)
Matt: As you guys are pressing forward, at this point, you guys are taking your time waiting and Tiberius is getting impatient, and is crossing his arms. "I feel like I should have gotten more materials. I don't think I'm quite prepared enough for this."
Laura: What? Tiberius, you prepared a lot.
Liam: Tibs.
Matt: "Not enough. Never enough".
Liam: You brought along a sack of mirrors, I think you've got enough. What do you need?
Matt: "I have an idea. I'll be back in a few days."
All: What, no?
Sam: Don't leave.
Matt: He sits down and starts making his teleportation circle.
Laura: No, no, we need that!
Liam: Tiberius.
Laura: We need that.
Liam: Tiberius.
Laura: We need that. Tiberius.
Liam: You are a heavy hitter, we don't know where we're going, what we're doing. He's strong. You're strong, in a way, maybe hang out a little bit longer.
Laura: He's actually got a lot of hit points, really.
Travis: Yeah, he's got a lot.
Matt: (laughs)
Liam: More than I do. You're stronger in frame than I am. Sure you want to go?
Matt: Tiberius leans in and whispers to you in a strange tongue and it sparks in your ear somewhere. (whispers) "The player's not here and the DM's trying to not make it too complicated for him to keep track of an additional character for this session." (all laugh)
Laura: I understand that.
Liam: (whispers) I know, but I'm just trying to give you a hard time. (all laugh)
Matt: I'll remember that.
Laura: Oh, no.
Taliesin: I grab Lockheed and we hold him hostage. (all laugh)
Marisha: You can't leave! (all laugh)
Laura: We need you.
Matt: "Don't worry, I'll be back soon and now I know how to find you."
Liam: (whispers) Send an iPad with Pike on it. (all laugh)
Matt: He finishes his teleportation circle and with a whoosh, with a flash, vanishes.
Laura: Shit. Really, Tiberius, really?
Marisha: He does that a lot.
Sam: It's very much in his character.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: Where'd Tiberius go?
Liam: He went to get an army, I think.
Laura: (groans)
Travis: That's fine.
Taliesin: Or more mirrors.
Marisha: It might be more mirrors.
Taliesin: Or an army with mirrors.
Marisha: An army with mirrors.
Liam: I can do magic. I do this great coin trick thing where I flip it on my thumb and then it lands in my hand.
Laura: And then, you pull it--
Liam: That's the end of it.
Laura: -- out of someone's ear.
Liam: It's right here.
Laura: Whoa!
Travis: We start walking.
Marisha: That's fun.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, I'm walking.
Matt: Progressing forward--
Marisha: It's a start.
Matt: -- you begin to--
Travis: Jauntily stealth ahead.
Liam: 40 feet out, yeah.
Travis: Like a beagle.
Laura: I keep a perception out to see anything.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye open for anything familiar.
Sam: Can I just bump into Vex and ask her to maybe scan ahead for dragons?
Laura: What do you think I'm doing?
Sam: Dragons, though. Six miles.
Laura: I'm scanning.
Sam: Don't you have six miles of dragons or something? Thank you.
Taliesin: Do you have to do the hands?
Travis: Is that your scanning face?
Matt: It's good to help out in the--
Laura: I'm thinking.
Sam: Six miles of dragons.
Laura: I'm wanting to see if I see any dragons. Do I see any dragons?
Travis: I thought you did a different technique last time.
Matt: You take a moment and anticipate the circumstance, and there is, within-- what's the distance on it?
All: Six miles.
Matt: Six miles?
Liam: Yeah, man.
Matt: You ascertain that there are quite a few sources of life in this vicinity, of some sort of dragon kin or dragon-like entity.
Laura: Was the behir a dragony sort of thing?
Matt: No. Technically not, from what you can gather, but you do gather there are a few blips that are three miles off north, at the center of the mountain range. You don't know how big or how dangerous, but you sense there are some dragon or dragon kin sources.
Laura: There's a dragony something.
Sam: Could be dragon eggs.
Marisha: Dragonborn?
Laura: I don't know, Scanlan.
Marisha: You're not picking up Tiberius six miles away?
Laura: There's dragony things, though.
Sam: Listen. When I poo somewhere, I can see everything.
Laura: I didn't poo. I'm sensing with my mind.
Travis: Listen, if we do run across a dragon, remember we have the dragon slayer longsword, which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls, and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature, it gets an extra 3d6 of damage.
Laura: What are you reading? How did you even know that?
Taliesin: That's the most complicated sentence I think I've ever heard you speak.
Travis: Sorry, I blacked out for a little bit. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Nothing.
Laura: Nothing. You're good, Grog.
Travis: What do you have to do to attunement?
Matt: Attunement, you take a short rest with the weapon, learning its properties.
Travis: Caressing it?
Matt: Essentially. Stroking it, making sure it feels comfortable.
Taliesin: Buying it dinner.
Matt: Nice spread so it feels welcome.
Travis: That's more than I usually do.
Laura: Maybe a steak, some salad. Shrimp cocktail.
Travis: Just in case you need a sword.
Liam: As we progress, I say into my earring, Scanlan, I've seen some of the logs she's left behind. They're not small.
Laura: (gasps) You are seriously. What?
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: That's disgusting.
Travis: I missed it. It must be good, though.
Sam: She usually buries them quite well.
Laura: Really gross, both of you. Enough.
Liam: They don't sense anything.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: Well, we're not heading north.
Sam: We're not?
Matt: You guys are heading eastish.
Taliesin: Westish. We're heading westish.
Laura: Nothing that I can sense.
Travis: Can we keep walking?
Matt: You guys came up on the eastern side-- sorry, the western side of the mountains. You're now heading eastward.
Taliesin: Oh, we came up on the western side of the mountains?
Laura: There's nothing that we're going to run across.
Liam: Just flip that.
Marisha: Western side of the mountains?
Taliesin: Western side of the mountains? So Whitestone's to the east?
Matt: Whitestone would be to the east of you guys.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. I thought we went up the eastern side of the mountains. I'm so confused. You wouldn't think I'd lived here before.
Matt: That would have brought you through the forest, and you were trying to avoid that. That's what I thought you said last time.
Taliesin: No, that's very true. Oh, god.
Travis: West side's on the shore side, right? Ocean's there?
Matt: There's a giant peninsula to the north. Either side would have been coast.
Laura: So we're not going to run into any dragons?
Sam: At least we're not going north.
Matt: You're aware that they're not anywhere close to you to currently be an issue, no.
Laura: Okay, we're fine.
Taliesin: In two or three miles, we'll take another check.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: (laughs) He winked at me!
Matt: All right, so.
Travis: It's like being blessed.
Sam: We're going to just keep going towards the town.
Matt: You guys press on, following this winding path that narrows at certain points and then widens for a bit. You come across, partway through, the twins at the front notice, around the edges as it begins to descend down into the beginning of the valley descent, you see an edge of the mountain that looks more angular than the usual natural formations of it. It almost looks like it comes to a point, like a very sharp edge, and a smooth side.
Liam: I'm not sure I understand. We see a drop-off?
Matt: It begins to descend towards the valley, and on the side of one of the giant--
Travis: Chasms?
Matt: Chasm you guys are at the bottom of. You see an outcropping ahead that's angular and pointed.
Sam: Like, designed by man?
Matt: Like it was sculpted, constructed.
Travis: That might have sentries.
Liam: Some sort of outlook or something. Something that was not formed by nature here.
Taliesin: Do I know what this is?
Matt: You--
Taliesin: History check?
Matt: I'd say, make an intelligence check. Roll and add your intelligence modifier.
Travis: I could do it with you, if you want.
Matt: You can make a history check. You know many things that exist here in the mountains, but at this distance, you don't see enough of it to actually--
Laura: (shocked noise)
Travis: He's not going to let me do it.
Laura: He rolled a natural 20.
Matt: For?
Travis: An intelligence check, because I'm an idiot.
Sam: He doesn't know the--
Taliesin: I kind of want Grog to speak truth right here.
Laura: He's an expert on mountains.
Matt: Actually, this works out interestingly. As you guys are walking forward and you're seeing this, and you're keeping back, Grog, you instinctively look over and go, oh. That's a stone giant fortress.
All: Oh!
Marisha: Shut up!
Travis: (laughs) I did something smart! (all laugh)
Matt: With your bloodline and knowing where you come from, and you've had a few close encounters in the Cliffkeep Mountains with a few of this kind, you've seen a few fortresses, and from the details of it, the way of the roof, and the scope of its design, and the way the mountain range lends itself to that type of topography, yeah. This is obviously a stone giant fortress.
Travis: Oh, and I drank some of that nasty dank in the fight with the Hammer, round two.
Sam: Wait, should we-- those are bad guys, right?
Travis: Yeah, that's bad.
Sam: We should not go that way.
Laura: We should definitely stay away from that.
Travis: Maybe go up on the other side of the chasm opposite of it?
Matt: Or you can move around the side, you're welcome to.
Laura: Maybe hide and make sure we're hidey-hidey?
Sam: We could stealth through it, we could invisible through it.
Marisha: Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: Pass Without a Trace.
Laura: I have Pass Without a Trace.
Travis: And climb along the opposite side.
Laura: And do we have invisibil--oh, no.
Taliesin: No, we don't, no.
Laura: You have--
Sam: I have some invisibility. Not great, though.
Travis: I have dust of tracelessness.
Laura: Maybe we'll stealth it.
Liam: Can I hide Scanlan under my cloak? Can he use his invisibility on someone else?
Matt: If he was to cast Invisibility on you--
Liam: No, on somebody else, so I'd just hide him.
Travis: What about one of those things that always works on me--
Matt: You could--
Travis: -- a diversion?
Matt: You would move very slow and you would have disadvantage on your stealth checks because you guys don't have a way to move quietly.
Liam: All right, all right.
Laura: No, I don't want to bring any attention.
Marisha: I could create a diversion.
Sam: What kind?
Laura: Like what?
Marisha: I mean, I could-- What's nearby? Is anything nearby? Any animals? Have we seen any wildlife?
Matt: There have been birds that fly through, an occasional harpy, in the distance you hear screeching and you guys keep quiet until it vanishes and disappears. (screech in the background music)
Taliesin: Wow.
Travis: That was perfect timing!
Laura: How'd that happen? How did that frickin' happen?
Travis: His ways are mysterious, my love.
Laura: You are magic.
Matt: I am lucky.
Taliesin: Holy cow.
Matt: What were some seafaring like seagulls and various coastal birds have slowly been disappearing and turning into more eagles and hawks, things that eat small rodents, more of a lush side of the hill. You see as you get closer to the valley itself that the actual forest that surrounds Whitestone is more and more of these birds of prey are beginning to show up. Other than that, you see very few small things other than occasional lizards about that big in your hand that live on hot rocks.
Taliesin: Should we observe this encampment for a bit, just to see what's happening as we slowly make our way around it?
Laura: Can we see any kind of movement? It's really far away, or--?
Travis: Couldn't hurt.
Matt: It's still a ways away right now, you're just catching the edge of it.
Sam: Are we a mile away? A thousand feet away?
Matt: I'd say you're about a good 600, 700 feet from it.
Liam: That's not that far.
Travis: You know, we could try to work our way up the opposite side of the chasm.
Taliesin: That would also allow us a good view of it as well.
Marisha: I happen to have Hallucinatory Terrain right now.
Sam: What does that even mean?
Marisha: It means exactly what it sounds like.
Sam: I don't speak your language.
Marisha: I can make terrain that's not real.
Liam: Do you remember when we psyched out the duergar--
Sam: It would block their view of us maybe? Perhaps?
Laura: Is it movable?
Travis: Yeah, it can't move with us.
Marisha: It could block their view of us.
Liam: Can you make some shrubs to come along with us?
Matt: You guys actually used it previously to camp for a night along a cliffside.
Laura: Right.
Matt: And made the cliff extend further than it was.
Liam: Yeah, we lured a bunch of duergar into a chasm that the ground extended over.
Laura: Let's try to climb up the other side and then see what we can see.
Marisha: I mean, I can do a lot of things, I can make a thunderstorm, I can make a sleet storm.
Sam: That would keep them in their fortress.
Travis: Could you make it fire?
Marisha: I could.
Taliesin: Or very cold if they came out.
Laura: They like cold.
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Marisha: I could, I could make a big storm.
Travis: We're also on a chasm, so if it gets wet and slippery and muddy we might all go down.
Taliesin: That's true.
Laura: Maybe get up at the top of it and then do this.
Taliesin: I like the plan of going up the other side of the chasm.
Laura: Can we try to climb the other side?
Matt: Certainly.
Liam: Giants like to throw fucking boulders.
Laura: Yeah, I don't wanna be down on the bottom.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys make your way up the other side, you're helping each other, I want everyone to go ahead and make an athletics check.
Sam: I put on my climbing gear, which I definitely own.
Marisha: An athletics check?
Matt: Okay, giving you advantage on your athletics check.
Laura: I actually own climbing gear too, does that help?
Matt: That would help you, yes.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: I have mine too, so I'll put that on as well.
Marisha: I don't know if I have climbing--
Taliesin: I don't know if I have climbing gear.
Travis: Attached to a rope and a grappling hook that's in my hand.
Sam: And it was the same. (laughs)
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: What am I doing? Adding what?
Travis: Fuck yeah! Nipple tits.
Matt: You have advantage, you add your strength modifier. Or your athletics is what it would be.
Sam: Athletics.
Laura: Do we add anything because of the climbing gear or is it?
Matt: You get advantage because of the climbing gear.
Laura: Ah, that's important.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26.
Liam: We were all using climbing gear or just--
Matt: No, those who have it.
Laura: I give you my climbing gear because I already get advantage. How about that? Does that count? No.
Matt: Because it is mountain? All right, I'll let you do that.
Laura: All right.
Liam: All right, well, I got 19.
Matt: 19.
Laura: Oh, so you don't need that.
Liam: Yes I do, I need it.
Sam: 11.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. Vex, what did you get?
Laura: I got 15.
Marisha: 11.
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: Okay. A couple of missteps and almost sliding, Keyleth, at one point, you grasp her by the hand and Grog pulls her back up onto the platform.
Travis: No, no, up here.
Marisha: Thanks, Grog.
Matt: Over time, you guys make your way along this very rocky and precarious, anywhere from five to three to two feet in width, sometimes even lesser than that and you guys are having to shimmy across. You make your way around and you can see this large fortress that is built out of extremely large and in-place stones and stonework. It looks ancient. For size-wise, it's two stories for a giant, which means it's probably close to six or seven stories of height.
Laura: Whoa.
Matt: Built into the side of a mountain, and it goes down almost like two giant steps. It's built on essentially where the giant bowl, the caldera if you will, of where this valley of this mountain range would be. It's built on the inside of it, so it's actually constructed, as you continue to descend into the valley. Looking at it, you can see openings, windows, there are areas up top where you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are used for anti-siege, for throwing off the top, stockpiles of that. You do see boulders around the ground that may have been thrown and not picked up. Everyone make a perception check.
Laura: I feel-- (whispers) Should I say?
Liam: (whispers) I'm not gonna tell you.
Taliesin: That's an intimidation check.
Laura: How did Trinket get up the cavern?
Matt: Hm?
Laura: Can Trinket climb?
Matt: Trinket--
Taliesin: Bears climb!
Marisha: Bears are good climbers.
Laura: They're good climbers?
Taliesin: They can get up a tree.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Roll an athletics check with disadvantage.
Sam: Disadvantage.
Laura: I'm sorry! But it felt wrong to lie.
Matt: Rangers.
Sam: Of course. It's an honor system.
Liam: Could I have given the climbing gear to Trinket?
Laura: No.
Travis: No. (all laugh)
Taliesin: You could've, it just would've been adorable.
Laura: But we could tie the rope around Trinket's waist.
Matt: Roll your dice.
Laura: With an athletics check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Does he get an advantage because of mountains?
Marisha: I love that he says 'roll your dice' like it matters.
Matt: Nope. He gets disadvantage because he's a big bear.
Travis: I told her not to say it, why'd you say it?
Laura: I'm just trying to be honest!
Matt: Which is appreciated.
Laura: Strength modifier? He got a 15, too.
Matt: Okay. It's been difficult, and it slowed your guys' progression, but you've managed to keep Trinket along with you; this large bear is now like pushing against the side. He's managed to keep up, but it's been a harrowing experience.
Liam: I've been behind him the whole time, pushing on his buttocks.
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: You got this buddy, you got this.
Matt: So, once again, perception rolls.
Laura: Sorry. Yes.
Taliesin: 20.
Marisha: 19.
Sam: 17.
Liam: Can I use passive perception?
Matt: This is active actually looking for something; the passive is more--
Liam: Well then, I get-- 26.
Travis: 15.
Laura: 19.
Matt: All right. You got 26, you said?
Liam: Yep.
Matt: Looking from this distance, and keeping the best visual you can see, there is no movement, at all, from the interior of the fortress. The two front doors, you see these two large stone doors that are the entrance to it. One of the doors is actually broken in half and left partially ajar and open.
Travis: We gotta go in now.
Laura: No, no, no.
Sam: They could be dead in there.
Laura: If something could've taken out giant giants. What could it be that could've done that?
Travis: Vampire giants.
Taliesin: It could've been the Briarwoods. We should see everything that's up here.
Sam: (sings) There are giants in the sky.
Travis: How awesome would that be?
Laura: (sings) There are big, tall, terrible giants in the sky.
Travis: Can we please go see? Can someone please--
Sam: You want me to go in?
Travis: Vax!?
Marisha: I can bird it. I can bird it and go in.
Taliesin: I can't believe I'm about to say this.
Marisha: Bird in and do a recon mission real quick?
Sam: You're going to bird in? They're going to see you fly in.
Laura: No, but she's a bird.
Marisha: I'm a bird.
Sam: It doesn't matter, they're still gonna see you.
Laura: Recon it.
Marisha: I'll go bat!
Laura: Yeah!
Taliesin: Now you're not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight.
Marisha: Not in a small--
Taliesin: I'm kidding, they really don't. That's a myth! That's actually a myth!
Marisha: They have echo vision!
Taliesin: They have actually very reasonable eyesight. That's a myth. You can look it up on Wikipedia, it's true.
Marisha: (laughs) Very reasonable eyesight.
Liam: You could also be a sparrow.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So, at about the two in the afternoon day sun, 'cause that's what it is. But you're fine. You become a bat--
Marisha: Bats come out during the day!
Matt: I know. She makes her way, down through; you swoop up to one of the windows and you glance inside and look around. You can see most of the furniture inside is in tatters. There are large, giant-sized tables and chairs that have been broken in half and strewn across the room. Make a perception check.
Laura: Ooh, come on, Keyleth!
Sam: Come on, oh yeah.
Taliesin: Oh yeah!
Marisha: Oh yeah! 28.
Matt: 28. Glancing inside you also see there are--
Marisha: (squawks) That's my echovision.
Matt: -- splatters and puddles of blood. Large bits of blood across the ground that is dried, but from your current vision from this, there is no sign of any living or individuals or bodies. There was a battle that took place here, but there is nothing present to signify who or what.
Marisha: How big is this room?
Matt: This room is about 25 feet tall
Marisha: Does it look like it goes deeper?
Matt: It does look like it goes deeper, there is a slight-- this is the upper floor, there is a grade, almost like a slow-- the word escapes me for a second.
Marisha: Like a downgrade.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: Like a ramp.
Matt: A ramp!
Sam: A slope.
Matt: Thank you.
Matt: A ramp that disappears below and into the lower floor.
Sam: A siggle.
Marisha: I'm gonna go into that-- (all laugh)
Travis: Careful. Oh no no no no! Don't roll! Don't roll! (all shout)
Taliesin: We turn on him.
Marisha: Fear of god.
Liam: Grog sacrifices the gnome. (all laugh)
Matt: So yeah, you do see the ramp, that's downward.
Marisha: I'm going to go into the room that I see is for sure empty, and go toward the threshold of the ramp.
Matt: Okay. Make your way down to the threshold of the ramp, looking down. Downstairs as well, it looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge of the room.
Marisha: Like it's been ransacked, or just a really nasty fight?
Matt: Like some sort of a major fight went down. No sign of any bodies or body parts. No sign of leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants lived in here. You just see large amounts of dried blood across the stone floors.
Marisha: Like something came in and slaughtered and completely stripped the place.
Matt: Or the giants slaughtered something horribly here and are currently out and about, you don't know. But--
Marisha: Can I tell if the blood looks-- how dusty is this shit?
Matt: Did you want to land and make an investigation check?
Sam: Call us in.
Travis: Do it.
Liam: Do it, Batwoman.
Taliesin: You are the night.
Marisha: How much dust goes pff?
Travis: (laughs) You are the night.
Matt: Quite a bit; a little puff.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Not a huge amount, but enough where it's not fresh, and a closer look, the blood's been dry for a while. Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: What is the sound of a bat coughing?
Marisha: (squawking and coughing noise)
Taliesin: Thank you. It's the simple things.
Travis: What did you get?
Marisha: Investigation. What about a 12?
Matt: 12. You can't really make it out, unfortunately. You know it's dried, it's been a little bit, but you can't quite gauge how long it's been.
Marisha: All right, I'm gonna go ahead and-- are there any other rooms, or is this it?
Matt: There's the upper floor, the lower floor. They're two large rooms on their own. It looks like-- You haven't actually gone down the grade yet, so.
Marisha: You said seven stories, so it's like room, downgrade, room, downgrade, room?
Matt: Seven stories for your size, it's two stories for a giant size. It's a large top room, and a large bottom room.
Laura: Ooh.
Marisha: Is there another room going off the bottom room?
Matt: There are just two rooms  top floor, bottom floor. You're currently on the top floor, looking down.
Sam: Split level condo.
Marisha: I'm gonna go out to the front door.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Nice flat, upper east side. Land, and I'm gonna bamf out of my bat form, and say, all right, it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want to check this place out.
Sam: Yeah, let's go check in.
Taliesin: Let's check it out.
Matt: All right, the rest of you make you way back down towards the front of the fortress and enter the inside. As you go through the front door, you see that the impact that destroyed it was from the inside out.
Sam: Oh!
Laura: Ooh.
Travis: Really?
Matt: So it's not like it was beaten in, it was beaten from the inside out.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And there is a streak of dried blood against that portion of the door. Looking inside too, you see there are a large cluster of matted hides and furs, like it made for bedding for close to four or five giants put in the corner, and there is a musty smell of whatever they were using to make it comfortable and ripe for their own personal needs.
Liam: Stealth!
Laura: Yeah, yeah, let's stealth.
Travis: Can giants become vampires?
Laura: I don't know, I hope not. You should use the dust of tracelessness, Grog, just so our footsteps aren't seen.
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17, okay. So what do you guys want to do in here?
Laura: Stealth.
Sam: I'm going to go downstairs.
Marisha: How dark is it?
Matt: You are downstairs at the entrance
Sam: Oh. Down the grade, I mean.
Travis: I want to look for any weapons that are lying about.
Matt: All right, make a perception check.
Liam: I want to ransack the joint.
Matt: Actually, it'd be more of an investigation check.
Travis: Me, investigate? That's funny. Eight.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Investigate or perception for me?
Travis: I find dirt.
Matt: You find a giant's fortress.
Liam: Investigate or perception?
Matt: For this? Perception is just seeing things at first glance. Investigation is going through and rummaging through to find things.
Liam: I'll investigate.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Shall I for downstairs?
Matt: Yeah, go for it.
Liam: 17.
Sam: 23.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are going through, looking at the blood and the way the splashes are, the blood that was spilled here was very thick, and large amounts of it, and it's probably been anywhere from two to three months since this entire fortress was ransacked.
Travis: Wow. MATT You do notice that some of the blood is dragged through, like something was dragged out of the puddle. But not for a long distance. Whatever was there was cleaned off at some point, or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those puddles of blood. You also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of things that were left there to rot in the corner. You find roughly 120 gold pieces.
Sam: I give it to Vex.
Matt: Over time you find a number of shattered glass vials that look like they once contained various elixirs, there is one that is unshattered.
Sam: I take it.
Matt: All right. And underneath all, covered in quite a bit of filth, but a little bit of metallic sheen streaks through, you see what looks to be a very, very well-crafted longbow.
Laura: (gasps) What is that?! What is it? What did you find?
Sam: Nothing, nothing.
Laura: What is it? What is that?
Liam: Here you go
Laura: Ah, what is this?
Liam: What are you going to do with it?
Laura: What is this?
Sam: I'll use it as a hammock.
Liam: Shoot yourself?
Marisha: Does it look like it's magic-y?
Laura: Can I tell what it is?
Matt: Taking it, it appears to have some sort of magical radiance to it. It looks like it's very well crafted. You recognize the construction is elvish in nature.
Laura: Hey, look at this.
Matt: And there are bits of mithril scrolling all throughout the bow itself, with platinum caps on the edge of the longbow.
Travis: Is it evil?
Laura: I don't know. Keyleth, do you know anything about magic-y stuff? Tiberius bamfed out.
Marisha: I can try, I'm not as good as he is, but I'll try.
Laura: What about you, Scanlan? Do you know anything about arcana?
Marisha: Ooh, 20!
Matt: Natural 20?
Marisha: No, 18; 20 total.
Matt: Yes, this is definitively a magical item, it is enchanted.
Marisha: It's definitely magical.
Matt: If you want to take a short time to work with it and attune yourself to it, you could get a better idea of what its effect is.
Laura: Okay. Thank you. Can we do that?
Taliesin: I'm going to look around a bit more, anyway.
Laura: I'm going to think about it real hard.
Liam: Probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of it
Travis: Can I walk out the front door?
Laura: I'm going to buy it a steak and I'm going to--
Travis: Can I walk out the front door and keep post on the porch?
Liam: I'm following Grog and I'm doing the same.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And I want to look in the direction we want to be walking.
Taliesin: I'm looking around, I'm trying to find out what happened to the bodies.
Matt: Investigation check for that. Here are the potion and the bow you guys managed to--
Laura: What is it, what is it?
Sam: I took the potion, I took the potion!
Matt: (laughs) Give that to Scanlan.
Taliesin: I know, apparently, from this roll that I'm in the mountains.
Laura: What is it?
Taliesin: I got a six.
Matt: A six. It's hard to tell. It's a very strange scene, and you have no inclination as to what may have transpired here. Who is the winner, who is the loser, and what has been done with the bodies.
Liam: Sorry.
Marisha: What did you find, what did you find?
Taliesin: Vex is making happy noises.
Liam: She's taking the bow for a spin.
Travis: She's attuning.
Liam: Seeing what it can do.
Travis: Do we see anything outside on the porch?
Matt: Over time the only thing you catch is occasionally you see flocks of birds moving through and swooping through the area. You watch one flock come up and begin circling a little bit.
Laura: Should we get out? Should we leave?
Matt: And then make its way down toward the valley.
Travis: Stealth.
Laura: Just leave. Let's leave. Stealth it out? Stealthy out-ie?
Matt: This is for Grog who is outside, roll a stealth check.
Liam: I'm out there too, and I rolled a natural 20.
Matt: Yes you did.
Travis: I might use your inspiration on this.
Sam: It's probably not in effect anymore.
Laura: (groans) No, you're in the mountains!
Travis: I am in the mountains.
Matt: Which means you have knowledge of mountains.
Laura: You don't get advantage?
Travis: I don't have advantage on--
Matt: Let me double-check on this, actually, what the specifics of the goliath's-- You don't take issues with cold climates, because you're at high elevation. You don't actually get advantage on anything mountain-wise; that is a ranger ability.
Travis: So can I add an inspiration on this?
Sam: I inspired him quite a while ago. How long does that--
Matt: It's been a while, how long does that last?
Sam: 20 minutes?
Matt: Yeah, that would've faded by now.
Travis: That's a one.
Matt: Oh, well, if it's a natural one it wouldn't have mattered.
Liam: Yeah, it doesn't matter, you can't add shit to one.
Matt: So while you sneak off to the side, you see these birds. There's a lot of birds there! You start yelling out to everyone, there's a lot of birds out here! Shouting it loudly back into the fortress.
Laura: Aw, shit.
Marisha: Grog, Grog, those might be centurion birds!
Travis: (loudly) That's what I said, birds!
Marisha: They might be spies! They might be spies.
Travis: (loudly) Yeah, I spy birds, they're flying everywhere. (yells) Go away!
Laura: Grog, Grog, inside.
Marisha: Inside!
Matt: The birds immediately start circling the fortress very close. You can hear the screeching. You can see the birds now, they're crows. A very, very thick murder of crows, probably close to a hundred of them, cawing.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace.
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait.
Sam: I'm still down there, investigating.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Sam: I pull a David Caruso and say, It looks like these giants had... big trouble. (all laugh)
Matt: You hear an echoing sound, yeahhhh! Formless, sourceless. You all stand there confused for a moment, then continue to try and stealth.
Travis: I run back inside.
Matt: Back inside. Eventually the crows take back to their original path.
Marisha: Oh, oh, but before the crows leave, before the crows leave--
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Yeah?
Marisha: Can I do something?
Matt: Yep. What are you doing?
Laura: Do it!
Travis: Do it!
Sam: Kill them all.
Marisha: I'm gonna go like Storm and I'm gonna Sleet Storm them. I'm gonna start conjuring a Sleet Storm over the top of this mountain, right where the crows are.
Taliesin: It's been so long since you've killed something innocent! Let's bring it!
Laura: Do it, do it, Keyleth!
Matt: As Keyleth concentrates for a second, you see her eyes, the actual color of her irises, begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the entire eye itself becomes this icy blue. A slight cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of her face.
Laura: Badass.
Matt: You start hearing this pounding sound on the top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to rain down. Go ahead and roll damage for the spell.
Marisha: Oh, jeez.
Matt: Sleet Storm? Oh, it's just a dexterity saving throw. It says heavily obscured, but doesn't actually do any damage.
Laura: But it knocks them all down.
Marisha: I know, they're like frozen though, right? Don't they get frozen with Sleet Storm?
Matt: Sleet Storm knocks things prone, makes the area hard to see.
Marisha: Knocks them prone
Matt: Douses flames.
Marisha: They're in the sky, I wanna hear birds hit the floor.
Matt: And a few do. There are a few birds that get pelted and knocked to the ground, encased in sleet, but most of it immediately takes note to get away from the storm and vanish and disappear back to--
Travis: Do they fall to the porch?
Matt: I'll say one does.
Travis: I run out there and I grab it.
Laura: No, no, no!
Travis: I rip its head off with my teeth. (all laugh)
Matt: Grog, you run out there and grab the one on the ground, it's struggling, and (squawks), there's ice gathered everywhere.
Travis: Yeah, shut up!
Matt: You grab it and you pick it up, you hear Vex go "Grog!" and you go (chomp) as she's staring at you. Silencing the crow. You hear the cawing of the crows dissipate in the distance and silence eventually takes the fortress once again, and you're left amongst the smell of death.
Laura: We should get the eff out of here.
Marisha: I think so.
Taliesin: We should probably leave.
Laura: Now. Stealth and out.
Laura: Dust of tracelessness. Hide ourselves.
Travis: Dust of tracelessness.
Matt: You make your way out of the fortress and begin to follow the path down into the outside of the forest and just as you make towards the base of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to take your vision, you can see just over the edge, a couple of small castle towers and what looks to be a single central spire of the castle of Whitestone.
Laura: They know we're here now. They know we're here.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: I think they might.
Laura: That was a sentry.
Travis: Why? They were just birds.
Marisha: Yeah, but we don't know--
Sam: Don't worry, we still have the element of surprise. Oh wait, no, we don't.
Matt: And with that, we're going to go ahead and take a break. All right, guys, we'll be back here in about 20-25 minutes.
Laura: Oh yeah!
Matt: Let us begin where we left off.
Laura: Oh, we're looking at the city.
Sam: There's the city! Shall we storm it?
Taliesin: It's a chalkboard.
Laura: I was pointing at you!
Taliesin: Well yes, so I can now recognize where we are.
Matt: Yes, you know this area very well. This entire forested area, the Parchwood Forest that encompases the entirety of this valley, toward the center of it, center north, is where Whitestone sits and for your reference as well, since you've been here before, you would know the city relatively well.
Sam: Maps!
Taliesin: This is the most exciting map I've ever been handed. Whoa!
Laura: What the what?!
Matt: Hold that over by your seat there for people to take a look at.
Sam: Don't. Just don't.
Taliesin: It won't fit in my folder.
Matt: That is a basic rundown of the size, design and shape of Whitestone, with Castle Whitestone toward the top, built on top of a leveled off mountain that marks the southernmost point.
Sam: This is the castle, this is the town?
Travis: And we're at the southern part of that?
Matt: You guys are actually coming in from what would be the northwestern side of the city
Marisha: So over here?
Matt: A little bit further down. About that angle there. That's the direction you're coming in from.
Travis: That's a detailed map, man.
Matt: I don't have any free time anymore. (all laugh)
Travis: They sell those stock, right?
Matt: Oh yeah, totally.
Taliesin: What's this little outcropping?
Matt: The little outcropping to the east of it was the graveyard to Whitestone. It's where most of the regular denizens were interred. It's been expanded over the years as the city itself has been around for quite a few generations.
Marisha: Does this graveyard have catacombs? Tombs? Underground passages?
Matt: Do you ask this of Percy?
Marisha: Yes.
Taliesin: Does it?
Matt: That graveyard does not--
Taliesin: That graveyard does not--
Matt: -- it is a surface graveyard.
Taliesin: -- it is a surface graveyard.
Matt: There is a mausoleum--
Taliesin: There is a mausoleum--
Matt: -- but that--
Taliesin: -- but that--
Matt: -- is actually contained beneath the castle.
Taliesin: -- is actually contained beneath the castle. (all laugh)
Travis: Riveting.
Sam: So knowledgeable, Percy.
Laura: So Percy, do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle?
Taliesin: I was wondering that myself.
Matt: There is one, one that you took to escape.
Taliesin: Yes, there is one!
Marisha: (laughs) Stop.
Matt: He has an aneurysm. Yeah, it is to the very western edge of the mountain precipice the castle was built on. It was built to be specifically an escape in case the place was under siege. Unfortunately, the circumstances that the evening happened so rapidly, and with creatures that seemingly were unnatural, the family didn't have time to make it out. And even you weren't fully aware of it. Cassandra, however, had overheard discussions about the passage and took that as your escape route. It's a hidden tunnel at the very base of the mountain.
Taliesin: I say we scope out the hidden entrance, see if it's guarded, see if they've discovered it.
Sam: To the town, or to the castle?
Taliesin: The hidden entrance to the castle. Instead of using it, I think we should possibly spend the night and get a view of the town, see if there's anything unusual.
Laura: I agree, can we camp out and hide?
Sam: Watch from afar? What's that going to tell us?
Travis: We could send one in.
Taliesin: We could send a bird in. Or an invisible gnome.
Sam: Or both.
Taliesin: Or both. An invisible bird-gnome.
Travis: Just to see if the town is normal or not.
Sam: It could be all vampires. Or it could be a totally normal town.
Taliesin: If it's all vampires, it'll be empty right now.
Sam: Because it's daytime.
Laura: Because it's daytime.
Marisha: We should do a fly-by.
Laura: We should definitely attack during the day.
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: We should send one by air and one by land.
Laura: What?
Marisha: Do you want to do that?
Sam: How far away are we?
Matt: You guys have been travelling through the forest, and it is a very dense forest, but it is mostly cold-weather trees, pines. And there is, you can see once you get inside the forest, the ground itself is very thick and there are elements of melting snow on the top of the trees, there was recently a snowfall in this area but it seems like it's been a while and most of it has turned to slush and water. You have about two hours of travel into the forest, and you all immediately catch the sound of distant howling.
Sam: Is it nighttime?
Matt: No.
Sam: Oh. That's scary.
Marisha: Distant howling? Does it sound like wolves? Can I make a nature check?
Matt: Yeah, make a nature check.
Laura: Stealth?
Matt: If you want to make a stealth check
Marisha: 26.
Matt: 26. Those are wolves. It sounds like a pack of wolves, probably close to anywhere from five or six.
Marisha: Would I think it's weird that they're howling during the daytime?
Matt: You gather that it is strange that they're out. Though it is getting later in the day, you are pushing four or five in the afternoon, the sun is starting to get closer to the horizon. It is strange that they're out this early, you're not sure what the reasoning would be for that.
Marisha: Odd.
Taliesin: I say we hide in the trees.
Laura: Up high.
Travis: Like up in the trees?
Laura: I like it.
Travis: We're gonna climb some trees.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: We're gonna Hobbit this shit.
Sam: We're just hiding in the trees, we're not going in to investigate?
Taliesin: Well, it's about to be nighttime, so we'll send a scout.
Sam: How long would it take to get into the town from where we are?
Matt: About two more hours of travel.
Sam: Ew. We'll get there at night. That's all right though, it's early evening.
Marisha: How long would it take me to fly over if I was a bird?
Matt: About an hour.
Sam: Vax.
Liam: Yes?
Sam: Can I ride you into town?
Liam: You want me to jog into town?
Marisha: You could ride me into town.
Sam: Well hello lady.
Marisha: Man, every time, Scanlan, every time.
Taliesin: Now that just got weird.
Laura: Could you turn yourself and fly?
Sam: Yeah, I guess I could fly.
Marisha: You wanna go invisible and jump on my back and I can eagle up?
Sam: Whatever you're into, baby. (laughs) I've become Austin Powers.
Laura: Ridiculous.
Marisha: Let's do it.
Liam: If the coach driver was any indication, there are going to be people--
Laura: Normal people.
Liam: -- in town.
Sam: What about this  I'll make us both invisible and you fly us in.
Laura: I like it.
Travis: Yeah, get on the ground, not just above.
Matt: All right. Now, Invisibility  how long does it last at full duration?
Sam: Looking. Up to an hour. Ooh, and it takes two hours just to get there?
Matt: Well, flying takes an hour. So, it's one of those things you could do once you approach it. It'll last you awhile, as opposed to doing it now.
Sam: How long can you be Polymorphed for? Forever? Concentration?
Marisha: For half of my druid level, we discovered.
Matt: So somewhere around six hours, five hours.
Sam: Okay, so you fly us in, and I'll Invisibility us right as we get to the gates.
Travis: And as they're going out, we get in the trees.
Taliesin: Make sure you bring an earpiece.
Marisha: He's got an earpiece.
Travis: Do we, the four of us, all go up in the trees?
Liam: Everyone get your own tree.
Laura: Everyone get your own tree?
Matt: Everyone who's in a tree, please roll a stealth check.
Sam: Except for Trinket, who can't climb up.
Laura: Trinket can climb trees! Bears climb trees!
Matt: Roll an athletics check.
Laura: I'm casting Pass Without a Trace. How long does it last?
Sam: You have to roll for Trinket.
Laura: Okay, fine! I guess I'll cast it tonight, never mind.
Travis: Plus ten to stealth?
Laura: Why are you being a dick, Scanlan?
Matt: Well, she did not cast it.
Laura: I'm not casting it yet.
Travis: 14.
Laura: What are we rolling?
Travis: Stealth.
Liam: I already did. Those are good rolls!
Laura: 21 for me, and what do I-- just nothing. 19 for Trinket.
Matt: Okay. We'll say you guys all manage to slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you can, as you guys take off. While you guys are away, making your way towards Whitestone, the rest of you look down, and just from a passive perception standpoint, you pick up the most detail: you can see there is indeed a pack of about five wolves and/or dogs a little ways away, but they're being followed by one humanoid. They're being guided, there is a pack out here for some reason, whether it be a hunting party or whatever other reasons there may be. It isn't a wild pack.
Laura: And they're close to us now?
Travis: I've been doing the dust of tracelessness.
Laura: So, I'll cast it on us now that they're closer.
Marisha: I wonder if that's the ground search party.
Laura: Maybe.
Travis: We'll see.
Laura: So, should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been, or do we have to roll again?
Matt: You'd have to roll again.
Laura: Shit balls.
Liam: So we're stealthing again in the tree?
Matt: Because she's casting Pass, or you won't get the benefit.
Liam: I'm already at a 32, man!
Travis: I'll take it.
Laura: You don't have to.
Liam: Let's do it, let's roll again.
Taliesin: Let's roll again.
Liam: What do we add?
Laura: Ten to whatever we roll.
Matt: Go ahead and just add ten to the previous roll. (all cheer)
Liam: Good.
Marisha: We want to keep our good rolls.
Matt: So, about five breathless moments pass as the dogs, wolves all get relatively close. One of them comes up and returns back to the pack. You don't get a good view of the individual that is currently guiding the pack, and you see them disappear between the thick trees in the distance. Make an active perception check for you, Vex, if you don't mind.
Laura: Not advantage. Mountains?
Matt: Is forest? No, you're in forest, now.
Laura: Oh wait! That's another!
Matt: You're sure that's a favored terrain? Then go ahead and roll again.
Laura: That was worse than the first one, that's great.
Matt: So your total is?
Liam: I rolled 20.
Laura: Okay, well, you didn't say you were doing it. 18.
Matt: 18, okay. It's hard to make out the details at this distance. You check out, it does appear to be a female form.
Laura: Oh, it's a chick!
Matt: Best you can tell, you can't tell specific race or details. Then, another minute passes before the barking and the howls fade and the hunting party seems to have been eluded.
Taliesin: There was no way to get a good look at who it was.
Matt: No. Do you want to make an active perception check?
Taliesin: Actually, I would love to.
Matt: Normally, if they'd passed by now--
Taliesin: Natural 20.
Travis: What?! Really?
Matt: A natural 20?!
Marisha: I'm looking at it!
Taliesin: This is an 'I love you' for those awful rolls earlier.
Travis: The golden snitch wins again.
Taliesin: That may be its name now.
Matt: You see the female form, it's not someone you particularly recognize. But the woman does appear to be older, probably in her late 40s, early 50s. She has some hunting gear over her shoulder. She has a short bow that's strapped over her, she has a quiver of arrows. She looks like she's hunting for food.
Sam: If she was a little older, Tiberius would kill her. (all laugh)
Sam: Give her ten years.
Matt: Give her ten years.
Taliesin: I don't recognize her, though?
Matt: No, you don't have an immediate lead of visual recognition. In the meantime, you guys make your way. Swooping down, you can see that cluster, that murder of crows circling out. It's making a large pass over this entire valley. You take this cue as you get to within visual range of the city to cast Invisibility on both of you. Is that a 3rd-level spell?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Okay. Both of you vanish from view, which is a strange feeling for you because you cannot see Keyleth, you're grasping onto something you can't see.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: And you just look like you're gliding through the air.
Sam: Can I do one of these?
Matt: Yeah, you grab on very tightly.
Marisha: (choking noises)
Matt: -- without choking. The eagle does not have--
Sam: Damn it!
Matt: -- human physiology. You get two fistfuls of feathers. And you really don't want an eagle to buck you angrily at this height. I don't think you have Featherfall so that wouldn't go well. Looking over Whitestone, you can see outside of the city there are some areas where the trees are carved out, and there is farmland set up specifically to grow food and to till to maintain sustenance for the people that live there. You can see that there's a small area that's also being cut for timber. Not a perpetual thing, but the wood here is, you've heard previously, one of the major exports here is very high-quality timber from this type of tree that is used for very exquisite woodcraft and furniture. So that's one of the major exports of Whitestone as well as the quartz from the mines itself. There are people in the city, but sparse. Make a perception check.
Marisha: Can I also make a perception check?
Matt: You may.
Marisha: With my eagle vision?
Matt: (singsong) You may.
Marisha: 14, so that's 24. And I have Keen Sight, which means I have advantage on all perception checks.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Marisha: I'll take that 14.
Taliesin: She'll take that 14.
Marisha: As opposed to that one.
Matt: Total of 14?
Marisha: 24.
Matt: 24. Okay. As you get close enough to start scanning over details, you can see that a lot of the buildings appear to be closed or empty. There are people working in the fields. As you make your way to the center of the town, there is a town square. There is a tree there, a very large, old tree that is twisted, with all these various gnarled branches that reach out. You recall Desmond mentioning something called the Sun Tree that is the centerpiece of this area. And you get a view enough of the tree to see that there are eight humanoid bodies of varying ages swinging from it.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: You also notice that, patrolling through the city at very slow paces, there are a few larger than normal humanoids.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: You see what appear to be approximately six giants patrolling through the town, but you can see some of them are like wrecked and broken. One of them is missing an arm and is dragging a foot behind it.
Laura: They're zombie giants?!
Matt: Apparently, whenever one of them is moving through, most of the denizens of the town keep a very wide berth, and generally avoid them entirely and go about their business, at a distance.
Laura: Oh my god.
Liam: I miss Pike.
Travis: Six?
Sam: No problem.
Matt: Like over all of the entire city. They're pretty well scattered about. After you do a full pass over the city, those are most of the details you can make out at this height. Anything further, any specifics, you want to go for before heading back?
Sam: You want to set me down so I can go talk to people?
Marisha: You want to talk to people?
Sam: Well, or at least eavesdrop. We don't know if they're all vampires or not.
Marisha: Does it look like there's a central part where there's a lot of people gathered?
Matt: Farmlands look likely to be the largest cluster of people. You can see, since it's getting to the end of the day, there are folks finishing up gathering the crops that were available to them or sort of planting as they go through. And you can see there's about five or six people that are all in one group. Most everyone else seems to be relatively solitary and trying to go about their business as fast as possible.
Marisha: The town square's emptying out?
Matt: The town square? Nobody is in the town square. People are avoiding it like the plague. There's eight bodies hanging from the tree, and nobody wants to be there.
Marisha: All right. I'm going to swoop down and find a tree, where the five or six farmers are, and perch, see if Scanlan can get a good--
Matt: There actually are no trees by the farm, all the trees have been cleared out to make the farmland. So there's actually a bit of the forest that's been cleared for that purpose.
Marisha: It's just open and empty.
Matt: Yeah. You can go to a tree that's nearby, but that's like 300 feet away.
Marisha: A rooftop? A wall? Anything I can perch on?
Matt: There is a wall. There is a wall on the outskirts of Whitestone.
Marisha: I perch on the wall.
Matt: Okay. You swoop down and you perch on the edge of the wall there. It's about 25 feet up.
Sam: I'm just going to walk down there. I won't be able to see you, so I'm going to leave a little--
Marisha: I'll keep an-- Oh, wait, I can't see you.
Matt: And you can't talk right now, you're an eagle.
Sam: I leave a little, like a canteen or something, right where she's perched, just so I know where to find her.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Smart.
Taliesin: Leave the mug.
Sam: Yeah, my stein. And then I'm going to walk down and see if I can stealthily eavesdrop on some conversations.
Matt: Okay. You make your way down the 25-foot wall she's perched on.
Sam: Oh, shit. Am I going to fall?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check to climb.
Taliesin: You say that out loud?
Sam: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17. The stonework here is old and you manage to not lose your footing entirely as you bring your way down. Thankfully, you're light enough, and the stones are not too large, so you can get some good handholds. You do, over the next 12 minutes or so, make your way to the base of the wall.
Sam: It took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet?
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Nice. I suck.
Marisha: Maybe whistle for me when you come back.
Matt: A lot of moments of (gasps) 'whoa, okay'. But, you catch yourself. I mean, you can just jump if you wanted to make it less. But, the duration of your invisibility-- you have about 20 more minutes before it dissipates.
Sam: Oh shit, I have to do this quick.
Matt: You look over the edge, and you can see that they have carts up and that they have what vegetables they have, and a lot of vegetables, even at a close look, a lot of them look withered. It looks like there is a general sense of frustration that the land itself is not producing quality crops. And even the people look unhealthy and gaunt by nature. Whether it be the cold winter recently or just their general spirit is broken, but there is a feeling about these people that life here is not what it used to be. There isn't a whole lot of conversation, there's mutterings here and there. "We have to make sure we get these back in time. Fill the cart, we have two carts we have to get in." And the other one's, "I know, I know, I'm trying," And they're putting it over there and there's a little bit of frustration among them.
Sam: He's doing walla. (all laugh)
Matt: One of them ends up counting the last bit of crop. "That's it, that's all we have. That is the entire pull for the day." And the older gentleman, who is overseeing it, grinds his hands and goes, "Sir Kerrion is going to have my hide."
Sam: Wait, wasn't that one of the people--
Matt: "At the very least, let's gather it together and hopefully Pelor will protect us." And the people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of Whitestone, where you guys are currently at.
Sam: Okay. I'm going to hustle back to the roof.
Matt: All right. Make an athletics check.
Sam: Jesus.
Marisha: I can come get you.
Taliesin: You'll hear a thump.
Sam: Eight. (all laugh)
Liam: Hopefully he lands on his lute.
Sam: No, it's nine.
Matt: Okay. 15 minutes. After five minutes of eavesdropping you realize that you are not going to make it up that wall, and you feel the magic of your Invisibility illusion about to fade. At this point, by the way, the sun has just hit the edge of the mountains, the sky itself is a vibrant, reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset is upon you.
Sam: I want to spend the night here. No.
Marisha: Can I see him?
Matt: He's invisible, no.
Sam: I will sneak around the corner a little bit, wait for an opening, and I lose Invisibility, which will drop it on her as well, and I will Dimension Door back up to the roof.
Matt: Okay. As you pass to the side, the illusion fades, you step into a small opening of dark, purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of the wall--
Matt: Grab the canteen.
Sam: Grab the canteen.
Matt: --and hop back on the back of her.
Sam: Oh, shit. Invisibility again.
Matt: Okay. Okay. You guys vanish, and Keyleth, you take off back in the direction you guys traveled from. In the meantime, guys, what do you want to have been doing? Are you just waiting, are you traveling further in, are you staying where you are?
Travis: (snores)
Taliesin: We have to wait.
Laura: Yeah, keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree.
Travis: (yells) I fall out of the tree.
Laura: And also, I'm restringing my new, awesome bow.
Matt: With the--?
Laura: With the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Which, by the way, is a longbow of sky sentinel.
Sam: Sky sentinel, what does that mean?
Laura: Once per long rest, I can use a Storm Arrow, which means that the next arrow I fire splits into three arrows. Roll an attack for each of them, they all get 1d6 extra for each one that hits. It's amazing!
Sam: Every time you use it, or is at a one-time--
Laura: It's one time per long rest.
Marisha: That's awesome!
Matt: Once per day, she fires an arrow and the arrow splits into three, and each one bursts into thunder damage, bursts of them.
Laura: Say what?! So, is it lightning damage or is it--
Matt: Thunder damage. It should say on there.
Laura: It says lightning damage.
Matt: Oh, then it would be lightning damage.
Marisha: It's a taser arrow.
Taliesin: It's basically a taser.
Matt: So yeah, it's pretty fun.
Sam: Thunder!
Laura: Thunder!
Matt: What's that from?
Sam: I don't know.
Matt: So, the night falls and the crickets begin to emerge, the slow mist begins to form.
Laura: Wait, our friends aren't back yet. It's already night and they're not back?
Liam: I just want to say that I pulled my hood down, and put on my calamari hat, and pulled the hood back over it.
Matt: Okay. So you take the partially rusted over, but functional, metallic skull cap that Clarota was wearing when you guys met in the Underdark, that Clarota no longer needs.
Travis: Because he's dead.
Matt: You place it on your head and it's a little loose. As you place it on, it rattles for a moment, and then it form-fits to your skull. Your hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging from underneath, almost Loki-helmet-style.
Laura: Looking snazzy, Vax.
Travis: Nice bonnet.
Sam: (imitating Clarota) I'm on your head.
Matt: There's a weird buzzing vibrational feel as its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so as you're waiting, but you get the sensation that it will offer some decent protection from impeding charm effects.
Liam: It tingles.
Laura: It looks like you have a mullet.
Liam: Yeah, dude.
Matt: A Loki mullet. You start to get really nervous about the arrival of your friends, until eventually you hear the flapping of wings. You look up and you can see, since it has taken an hour to get there, the illusion just fades, both a giant eagle and Scanlan appear in the moonlight, right above the canopy of the forest you guys are close to, and return to the place you were.
Laura: Keyleth, question. Can you make it look like we're not here with your foliage shit?
Marisha: I drop my Beast Shape, holding onto a branch.
Laura: You know, the illusions.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Good, good.
Laura: Can we camp up in the tree? So nobody can come towards us.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: What if we fall out?
Marisha: I Druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks.
Laura: Ooh.
Taliesin: Sticky.
Marisha: And, as usual, light some sage.
Matt: Takes about an hour or so, but you manage to pull from the surroundings these really nice, thick spider silk hammocks, that should be able to support your respective weights. Grog is the only one that might be questionable with the sheer amount of weight that is his form.
Travis: I like it.
Marisha: Maybe take a rope and tie it.
Travis: Nope, this is a trust exercise.
Laura: I'm using Hide in Plain Sight to make me and Trinket extra, extra hidey.
Liam: I have a question. The only reason I have this question is because I posted that video from a couple of years ago. Do I still have the unending rope?
Laura: I have the unending rope, motherfucker.
Liam: Why don't we reinforce with the rope?
Laura: Sure, why not.
Travis: You don't like the trust exercise?
Laura: That's where all the rope comes from that we ever use.
Liam: I'm sorry I brought it up. I'd love you to fall on your head.
Laura: Let's reinforce the spiderwebs.
Travis: No, I'm good, thank you.
Marisha: Whoa, Vax. Nice helmet. Don Quixote called.
Liam: Aerodynamic, isn't it?
Marisha: He wants his bowl back.
Sam: Before we slumber, we did a little intel, a little recon.
Laura: Oh, yeah. What's up?
Sam: Turns out the town is full of humans, except for these six vampire giants-- zombie giants.
Marisha: They all appear to be fairly miserable people.
Sam: However, this could be useful. Everyone in the town, the farmers anyway, seem to be gathering produce to deliver to the Briarwoods. We could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket of goodies, and maybe get through the front gate.
Laura: Don't you think they would know all the farmers around at this point? They've been there for a long time.
Marisha: They did reference Sir Kerrion by name. Oh, they referenced Sir Kerrion, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: We could make ourselves look like some of them. One of us has a hat of disguise.
Marisha: Also, there was something other really important.
Sam: What?
Marisha: The town was pretty much empty.
Sam: Oh, yes, this.
Marisha: And that Sun Tree, that what's-his-name-- Who said that? Jarett?
Matt: Desmond.
Marisha: Desmond. Looks like there were some executions that took place. There were about eight bodies hanging from that tree.
Laura: Why is it called the Sun Tree?
Sam: It's really lovely. I don't know, maybe it gets sun.
Marisha: I don't know. Why do they call it the Sun Tree?
Taliesin: Can I go with this? Unless you have a particular reason to--
Matt: I mean, you can go with-- There are maybe many reasons it's called the Sun Tree.
Laura: There's reasons. Maybe we need to battle them at the Sun Tree.
Taliesin: Legends say that before the castle was built, that the journey into the valley was treacherous and stormy, and the original builders of Whitecastle feared they would die. And this one, great tree stood in the valley, and it was underneath it that they took shelter. And as they began to take shelter, the storm broke. And the storm did not return until the castle was completed.
Sam: That's a lovely story.
Taliesin: We hold our festivals there every year.
Sam: And now it's being used as a--
Taliesin: As a gallow, yes.
Laura: Does it get a lot of sun?
Matt: You do know, and this ties into your story as well, because the guidance in forging the city of Whitestone, that tree was representative to them as a guardian of Pelor, the god of the sun. The protector of light, holiness--
Sam: Who that?
Taliesin: A very serious god.
Travis: That could help.
Laura: That could help us, because vampires hate the sun.
Sam: Why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun--
Laura: Maybe that's why they're hanging bodies from it, to taint it.
Liam: Maybe that's why it's protected. Maybe--
Sam: Are any of us religious with that god, or--?
Marisha: Can we call Pike through your magic poo?
Laura: Would she be able to hear us?
Taliesin: Tablet of Apple?
Sam: I can at least see what she is up to.
Liam: Keyleth, would you be able to revive the tree?
Laura: (gasps) Bring it back.
Sam: What would that do?
Marisha: Yeah, I can, actually.
Laura: I don't know. Bring up the god of the sun again, I don't know.
Sam: We're not religious people. We can't summon the gods willy-nilly.
Liam: We can please Pelor.
Laura: Don't tell us what we can and can't do, Scanlan.
Sam: I'm sorry. We can do all of those things. Yes, let's go in the middle of the vampire-infested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree, and then we'll just say, oh, sun god, please rain down sun here.
Laura: I like it. Let's do it.
Sam: That's a great plan.
Travis: Can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running, and seeing what happens?
Sam: We could.
Taliesin: I say, in the morning we take a look at the passage, see how well-guarded it is. And if it looks dangerous, sneak our way into the town. If people are not enthralled, if they are being forced to work, then maybe we can find some allies.
Marisha: Find allies in the town?
Taliesin: I don't think they're happy.
Laura: I think they're terrified. And I don't want to let them know we're here, for fear they'll turn us in, in hopes of saving their own necks.
Marisha: That's what I'm thinking. Yes, they're terrified, but this whole town's being ruled by fear.
Liam: I have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow. It may weaken the Briarwoods' hold on the psyche of the villagers here.
Laura: This is true! It could help out. Let them know the god of the sun is on their side.
Travis: I heard you're supposed to pee on a lemon tree, so.
Laura: Probably you and Scanlan are on that, I have a feeling.
Travis: Can I make a nature check to see if that's true?
Taliesin: I really wanted to ask. What does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: 19! That's 17.
Matt: In your experience with the roving band of barbarians, you guys enjoyed very much peeing on very colorful trees, of all sorts of plant life. All of them, generally, didn't seem to, over time, react well to the process, whether it be the fact that you all drank a lot of the time, so the content of your urine was probably not very hospitable.
Liam: It's known as a lemon party. (all laugh)
Matt: That's a whole different kind of festival.
Marisha: You killed Percy.
Laura: You killed Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around.
Travis: Operation tree rescue.
Matt: The lemon party is held on the far, far southern continent of Tubgirl, the region of Goatse.
Travis: I have an idea. Should we wait until the sun comes up, create a distraction, so all the undead giants come looking, and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree, and--
Laura: And bring it back to life!
Travis: -- let Keyleth give it a little love.
Marisha: And then what happens after that?
Travis: I don't know. It's an experiment, all right?
Laura: Then we get the fuck out.
Sam: Won't they know we're here? Won't the people see us doing things?
Marisha: I know. I feel that's the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night.
Laura: No! Didn't you say that all around the Sun Tree nobody's there?
Marisha: Yeah, we did that. What?
Laura: Didn't you say nobody's around the Sun Tree?
Sam: That's true. But we still have to get in.
Laura: We'll fly up and over. You just did the same thing.
Sam: I know, I know.
Laura: Fly up and over, land, bring the tree back to life, get out.
Sam: Are you sure you don't want me to be a carriage driver, and you'll hide in the hay of my carriage and I'll go straight up to the Briarwoods.
Laura: I feel like they know all the townspeople.
Sam: I will put on my hat of disguise, I will be someone completely different.
Travis: They can see through that.
Liam: I'm telling you, they looked right through me.
Laura: When he was invisible!
Liam: Invisible. They saw me.
Laura: They probably saw you!
Sam: So while he was transparent, they saw through him?
Liam: No, but I was heavily stealthed.
Laura: No, you were invisible.
Marisha: Oh, wow!
Matt: No, the invisibility faded when he attacked the guard.
Liam: When I beaned the guard. They should not have been able to see me.
Sam: I'm not talking about getting past the Briarwoods. I'm talking about getting past the guards that guard their castle.
Marisha: Here's another issue. It's going to take me a minute to do the tree.
Laura: How long?
Marisha: It might take a bit.
Laura: How long's a bit?
Marisha: Well, I mean, it's one of those things where the longer I do it the better it'll be. I can do it for up to eight hours.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Marisha: If I do it for up to eight hours, I enrich the land over half a mile radius, centered on a single point, and the land becomes enriched for a solid year.
Laura: I don't want to enrich all of the--
Liam: Question. What time was it when they were doing their little scouting thing they've just told us about? The sun was going down?
Matt: Yeah, they probably would've gotten to Whitestone around seven o'clock, and leaving right as the sun had fully set.
Laura: If we go right when the sun goes up--
Liam: Yes, we get there at sunrise, take those fucking beasts out, and you start at eight AM.
Sam: But then what?
Laura: We just sneak in. Here's the thing. I don't know if you want to get all the crops all fancy, because it'll just feed the Briarwoods. Maybe just do the tree area, which will be like two hours, maybe.
Marisha: Yeah? I think if I have a solid hour or two hours with it.
Sam: Once the tree is healed, we have no one of religious power to summon any god. We don't know anything about this god, none of us do!
Taliesin: I do, in theory, if I'm from--
Matt: Go ahead and roll a religion check.
Taliesin: A which?
Matt: A religion check.
Laura: A witch?
Matt: A witch.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16? Okay. Pelor is the god of the sun and agriculture. It's a good deity and is generally worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people that live off the land, and generally it's the most nature-based deity of the main spectrum, outside of Melora, which is the deity of nature.
Marisha: Oh. Well, dope! Would I know stuff like that too, then?
Matt: You know of Pelor, yeah. There are elements of Pelor's following that bleeds into your druidic nature, though you don't necessarily follow a deity.
Marisha: Right. We're free.
Matt: You believe that the essence of nature in itself is your patron.
Marisha: Totally.
Matt: You are not a religious man by nature, and you know that there is a strong following of Pelor in the town. The entire graveyard that you talked about earlier, that one is largely built around the imagery of Pelor. And of all the gods that are worshipped here, Pelor's probably 75% of the population of Whitestone where, in some shape or form, if not devout worshippers, at least were like, yeah, Pelor's cool.
Marisha: Here's my question. I feel Pike's energy tonight. Maybe, while I'm meditating, I can somehow reach out to her, and maybe ask her to get in touch with Sarenrae, and maybe Sarenrae can call up her homeboy Pelor.
Laura: Do you think that works?
Marisha: I don't know.
Travis: This is like phone a friend?
Marisha: We're not organized religion people, we Ashari.
Liam: The tree is called the Sun Tree. It's Pelor's tree. I'm not a cleric of Sarenrae, but these shitbags could not have set up camp in a temple of Sarenrae because there is too much goodness there, as there was around this tree in this town, and it's why it is dead. It's why it's being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead things, as you described. You need faith, Scanlan Shorthalt.
Sam: Me? I am the antithesis of faith.
Liam: Then you need to shut up and let us fix that tree.
Sam: And then what?
Travis: Who knows?
Sam: We're going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree, and then we're going to say, "Okay. Bring out the sun," or something.
Marisha: Hang on! What did you just say?
Taliesin: What?
Marisha: That thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing? Rally the townsfolk?
Taliesin: Rally the townsfolk. This is something I think-- I don't think that sneaking in is necessarily the answer. I'm not saying go in, guns blazing, but I say we let them know--
Marisha: You want to build a militia?
Taliesin: I want to build a rebellion.
Laura: I like it. They would recognize you, wouldn't they, Percy?
Taliesin: I have a plan.
Travis: You have a plan?
Sam: Does it involve healing the tree?
Taliesin: It does.
Liam: I don't think there is any sneaking in, thanks to those birds, so we make a stand out here.
Travis: Tell us your plan.
Taliesin: My plan is, we do our best to sneak in, we find cover. Obviously, you said there's abandoned buildings. We find cover. We heal the tree. I have some other ideas. We take those zombie giants out one by one, quietly.
Sam: We're going to be insurgents?
Travis: Shh! Let him finish the plan!
Sam: I kind of love this.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: It's like Attack on Titan. That's cool!
Taliesin: Let's start finding our friends, and we start making friends. We let them know we're back.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: I like having the people. It feels less like we're the United States.
Travis: Okay, where do we start?
Taliesin: I have some parchment. I have the thing I want to build, while I'm in the tree. It's very simple, and I want to show you what it is.
Matt: What is it?
Taliesin: I want to take some gunpowder and basically--
Sam: Make a pipe bomb.
Taliesin: Basically attach it to a piece of parchment. I want to wet it into a piece of parchment and let it dry so that when I set fire to that piece of parchment, I get a burn scar. I'd like to create a burn scar.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: Yeah, that's totally doable.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a tinkering check, just for the sake of a possible epic failure.
Marisha: A burn on yourself?
Taliesin: No, it'll scar anything. It just creates a very high heat.
Sam: Like a mark?
Marisha: Like a brand.
Sam: Like our mark.
Taliesin: Like a mark.
Sam: Like our mark.
Taliesin: Not our mark.
Sam: The resistance.
Taliesin: The resistance.
Sam: I need a beret. (all laugh)
Taliesin: I rolled a 23.
Matt: While the rest of you end up taking your evening's rest, Grog, you immediately snap your hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground.
Travis: (pained groan)
Matt: But you manage to make your way up there and just bear hug the tree trunk for rest. You're used to sleeping in uncomfortable situations.
Liam: I throw five or six pine cones at his head.
Matt: Over time, or at once?
Liam: At once.
Travis: Fucking gravity.
Matt: You manage to complete three pieces of parchment, roughly page-sized, with your black powder treatment, successfully. The mist rolls in and gets thicker and thicker, to the point where you cannot see the floor of the forest. The little bit of moonlight that manages to make its way through the boughs of the trees trickles through and then vanishes into these slowly-shifting bits of fog. Your breath, every time you exhale, is visible, as the cold night air begins to take. You find yourselves instinctively shivering, as you cannot grow close to each other for heat, nor build a fire. The night, while uncomfortable, you do manage to get an evening's bit of mostly uncomfortable rest, but rest nonetheless. Eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up and heats it up, the fog begins to fade away and burn away. You're at about an hour past sunrise as you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the temperature shift hits. You manage to relieve yourselves of your spider silk-based hammocks and/or tree grasping. Both you and Trinket have found this way of clutching onto the tree. Trinket's used to the wild.
Travis: This is, like, sunup, right?
Matt: It's about seven, 7 30 in the morning.
Sam: Can I do a quick scry back to the poo jar that I left back in our kitchen?
Matt: Certainly.
Sam: Just to make sure that our home base is okay.
Matt: You take a moment and concentrate on the kitchen. At this point in time, you can see early morning. Laina is currently in there, yawning, and is cleaning about and starting to make a small breakfast for all the guards. You can hear in the distance, some conversation in the distant room. It appears to be a couple of your various employed mercenaries having a conversation as she's making breakfast.
Sam: So they're fine.
Matt: They seem fine.
Sam: So I knock that one off, and I'll try for Pike.
Matt: Okay. Concentrating on Pike-- about two minutes of hard concentration. There's no connection.
Sam: They wiped my poo away.
Matt: You gather, due to the relatively fresh and unstable nature of this potion you had concocted, you can only have one source connection up at a time, so when you left it in your keep, it seems that the one you had at the temple of Sarenrae was alleviated of its magical presence. What was once a magical scry poo is literally just Scan-scat at the temple.
Sam: Which some could argue is magical in its own right.
Matt: Sure enough. With a high enough persuasion roll.
Laura: Teacher. Teacher.
Taliesin: Does it change color when it loses its power?
Matt: You don't know.
Taliesin: Damn it! I want to know.
Sam: Only one way to find out.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: Ask Pike when you see her again. (laughs)
Taliesin: Your poo power may come in very handy. This is good to know.
Travis: Let's go find an abandoned building and set up.
Liam: Could we throw in a Scanlan grenade and be able to see through it?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: A scat grenade.
Liam: A scat grenade.
Sam: Sure.
Liam: Scatlan.
Marisha: Scatlan!
Taliesin: Scatlan!
Sam: I could get in, shit in their bedroom, and leave.
Liam: You shit in your hand, and you toss it.
Sam: Oh, yeah. That, too! Pull the pin. (all laugh)
Laura: Yeah. Remember that. That's awesome.
Travis: This is what happens.
Laura: You could fly overhead with Keyleth.
Sam: Yes?
Laura: Drop it like a bomb!
Sam: And then we'd have eyes in there.
Laura: I like it.
Sam: I like this a lot. Give me something to eat.
Marisha: What?
Sam: I need some fuel.
Travis: Holy crap.
Laura: I have a sweet potato right here, Scanlan.
Sam: Sweet potato? That's good, yes. Some prunes?
Marisha: Yeah, something hearty.
Liam: All right. We're off the rails.
Travis: Step one of this.
Matt: So, you make your way down into the forest. About another hour and a half of travel before you start getting to where the trees begin to clear up a little bit, and you can see the base of the cleared-off mountain that Whitestone Castle is built upon, and the pathway that descends into the outer wall of the city of Whitestone.
Laura: How far of a travel is it down into the city?
Matt: It's maybe a quarter mile.
Laura: So we can do that a little amount of time.
Matt: Space-relation-wise, you guys are just getting to this side of the forest right there. Right there, and this is the mountain.
Laura: So if we're going to try stealth this shit in--
Travis: Do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one?
Sam: Wait.
Marisha: Wait. Wait. Which plan are we doing first?
Travis: First part is getting an abandoned building.
Laura: So that we can be near the tree to protect you.
Sam: So that we can be townspeople.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Right?
Taliesin: So you can get a beret.
Travis: Abandoned building, part one.
Sam: We're setting up shop.
Laura: Get into the town.
Travis: So who goes and finds the abandoned building?
Sam: Percy is known here.
Taliesin: Which is why I'm going to be wearing-- I haven't been seen in years, and when I was seen, I was much younger, and honestly--
Marisha: Yes, but the Briarwoods knew who you were.
Taliesin: I had different hair. Yes, they do.
Marisha: The Briarwoods recognized you instantly.
Taliesin: They did, which was disorienting.
Sam: But they're not on sentry duty.
Travis: We need a forward operating base, so who wants to be stealthy or invisible and find an empty building?
Liam: Question  for the Assassin path of rogue, at 9th level, if I have seven days, which is way too much time, I can impersonate anyone I want. In half a day, could I just be a dirty nobody?
Matt: Yeah. You'd be able to disguise yourself.
Sam: We also have the hat.
Matt: The disguise kit?
Sam: His hat of disguise. Percy knows this town. Perhaps Percy should wear the hat.
Travis: Does it require attunement?
Sam: Just a few minutes, I think.
Taliesin: I already have the hat.
Sam: Yes, you had it from the dinner party.
Taliesin: I've been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most defensible and the least likely to arouse suspicion. Things with basements?
Matt: A lot of the houses have basements. There are varying degrees of it. There are larger homesteads that were reserved for the actual nobles that ran the day-to-day life of Whitestone when your family was in power. As you heard from Desmond, probably the places where the new nobles live. Those are the ones that have the gates surrounding them: the larger homesteads scattered throughout the town.
Taliesin: That's too obvious.
Matt: It's far too obvious. There are many small abodes and even some farm-based hovels. The poor end of town is the farming side, which is the southwest, which is the closest area to where you guys made your stop earlier.
Taliesin: I would almost say a shopping district. If there's an abandoned storefront.
Matt: The shopping district is the center of town around the town square.
Laura: Around the Sun Tree?
Matt: Yeah. Right there.
Taliesin: Might be too close.
Sam: Before we go marching in there, finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult. We'll need food.
Laura: Are we living in there?!
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: We're not going to be there for long.
Travis: We have dried food rations.
Taliesin: We have food rations. We have options.
Laura: We've got food for days.
Sam: We might be there for days and days.
Laura: We've got food for days.
Travis: We've got dried food rations.
Sam: We also have to go around town and, forgive me if I'm going too far with your plan here, but aren't we trying to win allies among the people?
Taliesin: I have a plan.
Sam: But we'll need to communicate with them. How?
Laura: He has a plan.
Travis: He has a plan.
Sam: (sighs) All right.
Travis: Come on. Drop your pants and get with the plan.
Marisha: What time is it? Have we gone to sleep, or are we waking up?
Matt: You guys are awake. After this discussion, I'd say it's about 8:00 in the morning. 8:30.
Taliesin: Let's make our way in.
Liam: This is the time.
Laura: We should stealth in.
Marisha: Are we doing the tree thing right now?
Matt: Actually, your travel to the city and you're on the outskirts of it now. It would be closer to 9:30.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: Yeah. We try to get in.
Taliesin: We find a place to at least set up our operation.
Marisha: Well, that's what I was going to say. Do we want to find operations, try and recoup--
Liam: We don't really know what we're going to find this morning. Those big guys could still be there; we don't know.
Taliesin: We don't.
Liam: We don't know if there are people in the pocket of the Briarwoods here.
Travis: It's like 12% of a plan.
Marisha: If we take a day to get in and get settled, I can do a Heroes' Feast and then I start crack of dawn in the morning?
Liam: I think that's a good idea.
Taliesin: Let's get in and set up.
Liam: Hole up. Let's find a place.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Wait, we're just going to walk into the city?
Taliesin: No, we're going to stealth into the city.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: We're going to cast Pass Without a Trace on everybody.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Beard check?
Travis: That was an eight.
Matt: Stealth?
Travis: Beard check.
Matt: Oh. (laughs) Your beard is pretty much at the fullest it'll ever be. You gather you can probably get a little more thickness to it, but your beard is at maximum, Grog. The fact that you even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of magic in its own right.
Travis: Amazing.
Liam: You would be a freak.
Travis: Is it like that Vidal Sassoon commercial? Whip it.
Marisha: That's dope.
Taliesin: Isn't that dope?
Sam: Grog, I've heard that no one in this town wears a beard.
Laura: Oh, natural 20 on stealth!
Travis: You can forget it. I won't go in.
Matt: So you guys are traveling as a group. I need stealth checks from everybody.
Taliesin: Do we have Pass Without a Trace?
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Can we each take a little bit of time to look more like commoners?
Taliesin: I'm wearing my hat, too.
Travis: Look like commoners?
Sam: I rub dirt all over my face.
Travis: Shit, I'm a goliath.
Laura: Plus, we have a bear.
Sam: You should try to look less handsome.
Marisha: Yeah, we do look like quite the motley crew.
Liam: I'm wearing a natural 20.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Did you roll a natural 20, as well?
Liam: I did.
Matt: Both of you guys rolled natural 20s in stealth?
Liam: Had a little help with Luck, but I got it.
Matt: There you go.
Taliesin: That's really good, because I rolled a one.
Laura: Oh no.
Sam: We've got Pass Without a Trace, so 28.
Taliesin: 11.
Marisha: Still a failure.
Travis: Are we all going together? Are we not sending one person in to go find an empty building?
Sam: We're all going together.
Matt: You guys are all going together. You dirty yourselves up a bit. You're still a large goliath. You're still a few half-elves, a gnome.
Laura: There's still a bear.
Matt: Outside of illusion magic, you're still going to stick out like a sore thumb.
Laura: Could we cast illusion magic? Do we have it?
Sam: What's illusion magic?
Liam: I'm walking 50 feet in front of everybody else.
Laura: Seeming! To make Grog and Trinket look like commoners.
Liam: I'm 50 feet in front of everyone else.
Laura: Yeah, do that!
Marisha: Oh, yeah! Seeming us?
Sam: Sure. All right. I will cast Seeming on us.
Matt: This is a legit use of Seeming, too. Okay.
Sam: We'll all look like dirty--
Marisha: As opposed to the cows? Come on.
Sam: -- dirty, ragged peasants.
Matt: Trinket, as well?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Trinket looks like a donkey.
Laura: No, he'll just be a really drunk peasant.
Marisha: A donkey. A mule.
Sam: Can I just say this? Can we just leave Trinket behind--
Laura: No!
Sam: I don't want to walk in there with a bear!
Laura: He'll look like a fucking donkey, or he'll look like another commoner.
Sam: I think I can only make us all look the same.
Laura: Then he'll look like a fucking commoner.
Matt: Of similar size. I believe, as far as Seeming is concerned-- If not, then I'll allow it for the purposes of this.
Laura: He'll look like a commoner--
Marisha: A Clydesdale!
Laura: -- a weird commoner.
Travis: Leave the bear.
Taliesin: A milk cow!
Laura: I'm not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where there's hounds around, and there's fucking vampires and birds flying around, fuck you!
Sam: Oh, wait, no! You can give each target a new appearance.
Matt: Yep!
Sam: So I can make everyone look a little different.
Matt: Each creature can seem a foot shorter or taller, or appear thin, fat, or in between.
Marisha: Make him look like a milk cow.
Matt: You can't change their body type. So, Trinket will still be a four-legged creature, but you can make him look like a different four-legged creature.
Laura: There you go!
Sam: Okay. He's a milk cow.
Liam: Real talk, real talk, Scanlan. My sister will cut you.
Travis: Or do you want him to be a donkey, something we can move. Milk cows are slow.
Liam: Bring the bear.
Taliesin: Donkeys can move more quickly. This is true.
Sam: All right. Donkey.
Laura: All right.
Sam: He's an ass.
Matt: All right, so Trinket takes on the form of a donkey.
Laura: (laughs) So are you darling, so are you.
Travis: Just like her owner.
Matt: The rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids, you--
Laura: (fake coughing)
Sam: I make myself look like a weird hunchback, sort of, not all there.
Matt: Okay, so you guys look like pretty rough peasants, dirty faces. You know, hair a little razzled. It looks like you've been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of Whitestone for quite some time--
Travis: I wanted to be a model.
Matt: -- with a donkey.
Taliesin: (goat bleat)
Matt: So. You guys, utilizing your stealth checks and the Seeming, you make your way up to the-- which side of Whitestone are you coming in from?
Taliesin: Thank you for the double 20.
Matt: Percy?
Laura: Where are we coming up?
Taliesin: Coming in from the west.
Matt: Okay, so you come into this entrance here. You make your way into the center of town, blending in best you can. There are a few folks who see you enter, just give you a strange look. You all are unfamiliar to the denizens of Whitestone--
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: -- but you don't look like a threat, per se. So you are noticed, and some people seem to just stop and watch you pass, but no one seems to make any active mention, note, or change in behavior towards it.
Travis: Are we checking buildings while we're walking through?
Laura: I have passive perception of 21; I'm always looking.
Liam: I walk over to just one random person on the street and say, anyone hiring hands? On farms?
Laura: Our farm burned down!
Matt: (laughs) Make a deception roll. I'll give you advantage on it because the Seeming does give you the visual perspective of being close to their type.
Liam: That is a four-- No, hold on--
Laura: No, no, no.
Liam: I'm gonna use Luck, that's the Luck.
Travis: Was the first number gonna be a 40?
Liam: No, it's not 40. So it's 14.
Matt: Okay. That's two Luck rolls, by the way, that you've spent.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: The woman you approach who's probably in her early 30s, pale blonde hair, looks like she actually might be losing it in some places, gives you a look and goes, "You poor people shouldn't be here."
Liam: We just need some work.
Matt: "You'll find it, but you're not going anywhere else. Welcome to Whitestone." She turns around and walks back, joining arms with apparently a man that she's paired with, and the two of them just walk away, a bit dumbfounded that people walked into Whitestone. As this happens, you glance over your shoulder and you see coming from the northern edge from this side wall-- (sounds of booming footsteps)
Laura: Oh, we should avoid that shit!
Matt: A very tall, noticeably undead giant with its jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge, dried, caked blood across its chest, it's just dragging this large club behind it.
Liam: Where are we? What are our surroundings right now?
Matt: You right now, you're in a T. To the right and left are roads that go along the inside of the wall that surrounds Whitestone, to the front of you is the path that leads further into the city.
Laura: Let's go into the city!
Travis: We casually begin--
Taliesin: I wanna head through the city, possibly in the direction of the cemetery.
Matt: Cemetery's over here.
Taliesin: Yeah, I wanna head in that direction.
Matt: All right. So you guys make your way through--
Laura: Keeping an eye out for, you know, buildings that look clustered and abandoned that we can hide in.
Taliesin: What's changed?
Matt: What you've noticed has changed is, one largely, the population is far more sparse than you recall. What was once a bustling city, you're now seeing about half as many people as you would would see this time of day. Going through, everyone seems to be in relatively poor health. There are a few buildings that look long-term abandoned, immediately in this area here, in the outskirts, catches your guys' eye. You do notice that the corner lamps that you had set up at the different corners of the streets appear to be shattered.
Travis: Interesting.
Matt: There would be like, you know, glass oil lanterns that at night someone would go around and light them after the sunset. The posts that hold them now are all either broken, or the glass itself has been shattered.
Marisha: They want it to be really dark.
Taliesin: They want it to be really dark. I'm also thinking about that cemetery.
Sam: We're not gonna live in a cemetery, that's super creepy.
Marisha: As opposed to all of the other things we've done?
Taliesin: Everything here is super creepy.
Laura: Is there any other abandoned buildings around?
Marisha: As opposed to sleeping in the Underdark?
Matt: There are plenty of buildings that look dark and mostly untouched in this section here, as you begin to move closer and closer inward.
Taliesin: Let's get east of the center square and set up camp.
Laura: Okay. Where's the castle? Is it on the top of the--
Travis: It's north.
Laura: Oh, it's that thingy? Okay.
Sam: We're trying to shoot for here?
Matt: Okay. You guys move this way, as you push towards the center of this here. You--
Sam: You speak Giant, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: You move past the center here and to the left of you, you can see the town square and there it is, the Sun Tree. Very, very large, you imagine beautiful tree at one time, full height was probably about 40 feet tall. The branches twist out, and almost look like they're hanging loosely, the ends, everything looks droopy and desolate; there's not a leaf on it.
Marisha: Can I do some sort of a check from a distance to see if I can recognize what kind of tree it is?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: Okay. It's hard to tell from this distance, there are a number of types of trees it could be. It's not indigenous to this land. The fact that it grew here means that either it was transplanted, or it was some sort of--
Marisha: Magical grower.
Laura: (sings) Divine Intervention!
Matt: -- magical creation for its presence.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: And you do see the silhouette of the eight figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches.
Travis: We continue on. Don't pay too much attention to it. Find a place to post up.
Marisha: Right. Don't get emotional.
Laura: If you, if you do your nature-y spell from inside a building, does it still do the same thing or do you have to be next to the tree while you're doing it?
Travis: That's a large radius, right?
Marisha: So the way the spell works, I can do it one of two ways. I can do it instantaneously, essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me, or I can wait and I can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant--
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: -- life energy and heal the farmlands and it would stretch out for a really far radius.
Laura: Let's keep moving.
Marisha: I'm gonna probably wanna do more the second one.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Do it from inside a house.
Matt: Did you guys want keep moving down this path, to go through the square, closer to the tree, do you want to go southward?
Marisha: I don't know, it's a central point.
Laura: We avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight.
Matt: Okay, so you're going this way.
Laura: Yeah?
Liam: There's a larger building, isn't there? I can't see--
Taliesin: Actually, I would say let's get a good look at the tree, let's walk by it.
Sam: Oh, we're gonna walk by the tree?
Marisha: Look like it's no big deal.
Travis: I know.
Matt: You guys turn left, and you make your way towards the town square. And as you enter the square, looking around, you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for selling of meats and other goods, what was a small, you know, barter-and-sale based hub of this town-- nowhere near on the scale of Emon's bazaar, but you know, enough to support this town-- desolate. All look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time. As you get a closer look to the-- actually I'm gonna have you guys all roll perception checks. You're not getting too close to the tree.
Travis: Five.
Sam: Nine.
Liam: 26.
Laura: 19. No, that's a-- yeah, 19.
Marisha: 14.
Taliesin: 23.
Matt: As you guys are keeping on the outskirts of the square, it's hard to make out the details, and the weathering has muddled the figures that are hanging there. Percy and Vax, you guys notice the figure on the far left--
Liam: The body.
Matt: The body on the far left has red paint smattered across its face and its arms. It's wearing a dirtied, green, vest-like robe that dangles below it as it hangs there, loosely. Immediately to the left of it you see what looks to be the body of a child. The child is dressed up in a purplish, billowing shirt, very fine silk shirt and pantaloons, and is dangling there next to it. To the left of that you see what appears to be a female, adorned in greens and browns, looks like red paint has been driven through the hair, and dangles to the left of that figure. Next to that, you see what appears to be--
Taliesin: I am walking the fuck away.
Matt: -- you see what appears to be another woman, dressed in dark blacks and browns, leathers, some furs across the top, dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see another man dressed similarly, dark greys and blacks, long dark hair, dangling. To the left of that you see a rather large man, older, rotund, probably in his forties, clothing padded but mostly open chest, hair completely shaven bald, it looks like there are dark scars placed across the face, hanging. To the left of that you see, this figure is actually not humanoid, you see what appears to have been--
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: -- a recently hunted bear, who is dangling.
Marisha: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sam: Wait, what? Is that us?
Marisha: It looks like us.
Travis: What?
Marisha: It's us!
Sam: They killed people they thought were us, or they killed--
Liam: Or it's a message.
Sam: Or it's a message to us.
Marisha: Do they look like us or were they just dressed like us? Are they made to look like us?
Matt: Do you want to get closer and look?
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm a little curious--
Travis: Do you want to get closer and look? Are you sure--
Taliesin: Is there anything around the tree other than us?
Travis: They're probably watching the tree.
Taliesin: Is there something at the base of the tree, is there anything?
Matt: From what you can see now, nothing but just rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting below it. Approaching, it looks like each one of these bodies has been dressed up. It looks like the color in the redhead's hair has been smeared through with paint. It looks like the person who has been painted red has been slapdash. You gather with a moment of looking at it that these were not individuals that were caught this way. This was set up as a message.
Laura: (whispers) My god.
Sam: Oh shit.
Laura: Keep walking, keep your head down and keep walking.
Marisha: Oh, my god.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Marisha: Oh, my god.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Sam: You mean in town? Of course they are!
Travis: No, remember they have to, like, be where the soil they came from is?
Laura: No, they have, like hideouts, they don't have to be where the soil they came from is.
Travis: I don't think they're here.
Sam: Holy shit.
Liam: They're in their keep, buried deep.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: You guys continue past, down this pathway. There's other buildings you see in the vicinity that, you know, look abandoned or for the most part unoccupied. I'd say about one in every three buildings looks like it's in disuse.
Liam: Did we see this big building right here as we walked by? Yeah, that big one.
Matt: You guys came-- made this path-- you can see a little bit, you can see is a--
Taliesin: I should know what it is, anyway.
Matt: -- iron fence, it used to belong to one of the noble families of Whitestone. Each one of these large buildings here, these three, and you remember this, were the three families that ran the town.
Taliesin: We can't go anywhere near those buildings. We have to stay as far away as humanly possible.
Marisha: Question. You said there were eight bodies?
Matt: Eight bodies.
Marisha: Is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer?
Laura: That was the first one.
Matt: The one's painted all red--
Travis: The one's painted all red--
Laura: There wasn't a gnome cleric one there.
Matt: No. There was a bear.
Liam: There was no cleric when we faced them before. All of us who stood against them in Emon.
Travis: We're all there.
Sam: Body of my guy. Is he sort of handsome?
Marisha: But, it does mean that it was because of when they saw us in Emon--
Matt: Think of an eight-year-old child.
Laura: It was a kid, yo.
Sam: Oh, it was a child? Oh, god.
Marisha: -- because Tiberius wasn't here with the crows.
Travis: No, it was because of Emon.
Marisha: It was because of Emon.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: So, can we get like a vague idea of how long these people look like they might have been here?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: (whispers) Fuck, I'm not good at this shit.
Taliesin: Can I help?
Matt: Sure. It would be advantage on that check for you.
Marisha: Oh, that, you know, that wasn't bad. Woo!
Taliesin: Oh! Never mind.
Marisha: I'll take that 19, 21?
Matt: 21? You gather these bodies have probably been here for the better part of a week, week and a half? There is some mild decomposition starting to settle in, there is a bit of bloating to some of them. Couldn't have been much longer than that.
Sam: A week? That's before we set out.
Marisha: Why would they put a warning for us here in the city?
Sam: They assumed we would come, but they don't know that we're here.
Taliesin: They invited us.
Liam: Those birds might have told them we were here.
Sam: This was a week ago, this was before we were even close.
Travis: Let's stick with the plan.
Taliesin: Sticking with the plan.
Sam: Let's go find a building.
Taliesin: Going to go find something that's a decent distance away from the three noble households, that has a reasonable view of the tree.
Travis: Yeah, 150 feet from the tree.
Matt: That would probably be somewhere in this vicinity here, as the three main houses are right there.
Taliesin: Something with a second-floor view, but with some distance.
Travis: Preferably three bedroom, three bath.
Matt: (laughs) I'd say make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Meh. Six.
Laura: Can I look out too, I've been on the lookout for a building the whole time!
Matt: Yeah. I'll say, I'll say it takes the better part of the next hour or so, and you do a little bit of meandering to find it, you guys are being stealthy best you can through alleys and such, but even so you are out in the open, midday, but you are also, you know, under Seeming.
Marisha: Does it look like there's a covering nearby, roughly, 30 feet or so from the tree?
Laura: 30 feet?!
Sam: 30 feet?
Matt: No.
Sam: What about 150?
Matt: No, the tree is out in the center, and essentially the nearest building is probably anywhere from 100, 200 feet away from it. It's the tree out in the middle of the square, and the square, which used to have probably more things towards the center, more temporary establishments, have all been put to the sides and put to disuse.
Sam: Maybe underground stuff.
Matt: You do manage to see what appear to be what was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is silent, closed, the doors locked and chained. The windows look dusty.
Laura: Can we sneak in the windows, so it keeps chained?
Matt: Okay. You go around the side of it, to the alley.
Taliesin: Dust of tracelessness.
Laura: Yeah, Dust of tracelessness.
Sam: Are you guys going in?
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: This is where we're going to hole up.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I kind of want to talk to the tree.
Laura: Then go talk to the tree, Keyleth.
Matt: The window is locked.
Sam: Wait, not now. Not now.
Travis: No, no, no, no, no, not yet.
Sam: Let's find a place first.
Travis: Let's post up first.
Liam: What am I, stealthing right now, or checking for--
Matt: Continuing your guys' stealth as your going, this would be your attempting to unlock the window.
Liam: Oh, unlock, okay. So that's a 22.
Matt: 22, okay. It takes a bit to jostle it in a way, because the lock is on the inside, but there are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get something underneath to push it aside. You manage to get the window open, and as you pull it up the dust billows up around you, you set it aside. You step in and the place smells stale, musty. Dark. There are, you can see, candlesticks set around that have not been lit for a while, and the oil lanterns that normally light the interior of the main tavern social area have been long in disuse.
Laura: Is there a cellar here?
Matt: If you guys want to look around. Are you all going in?
Taliesin: Yeah, we're all going in.
Travis: Yeah, we're all going in.
Matt: You as well? Or are you talking to the tree?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Come inside.
Marisha: Does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Not yet, not just yet.
Travis: Don't bring that-- don't mess with that thing.
Liam: Yeah, come with us. Keyleth, come with us.
Marisha: All right, all right.
Travis: Once we do it, it's like ringing a dinner bell.
Marisha: All right, all right, all right, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Sam: I'm gonna look for a brothel! (all laugh)
Taliesin: That's going to be the saddest brothel.
Marisha: The saddest brothel!
Matt: You find your way inside the abandoned tavern. And it is what was this giant L-shaped building, right here in the corner of the town square. There is a second floor, approximately runs 20 rooms. They are all currently unlocked, some of them left open, the bedding covered in dust, some of it looks like it was left in a hurry.
Travis: Yeah, we'll take it.
Matt: There is a cellar.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You find the cellar, and down there, there are a number of empty barrels, and a couple of ones that are still full.
Sam: Ooh!
Matt: One that appears to be a heavy whiskey barrel, probably about twenty untouched wine bottles. A little bit of ale, but it looks like a lot of ale was either completely used, or taken with whoever left and abandoned the premises.
Laura: I think we can definitely use these for explosions, if we need them.
Marisha: Ooh!
Sam: Or to drink.
Taliesin: Muscle relaxers. Is there a view of the tree?
Matt: Going from a number of the rooms up top, not every room has a window, but it's like every third room on that side of the building does have a view of the entire square.
Marisha: Can I get an eye as to how far away it is?
Matt: I'd say probably about 200 feet? 250 feet?
Laura: Can you go invisible and still talk to the tree?
Marisha: Hmm?
Sam: I can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree.
Laura: Can you talk to the tree if you're invisible?
Matt: If you cast a spell while invisible, unless it's Greater Invisibility, then it will drop the illusion.
Sam: I can make her invisible.
Marisha: I got an idea.
Sam: We can burrow under, we can--
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: -- find something closer.
Marisha: Actually, what are we up to right now? Are we doing anything? Are we busy?
Sam: Well, there are windows on the first floor, right?
Matt: There are some windows in the tavern; there was one on the second floor.
Laura: We're in the cellar, that's why I went to the cellar.
Marisha: Oh, there's a cellar?
Sam: I'm gonna just find some old rags, or anything I can find, tablecloths, and just cover the windows.
Laura: But make it not obvious, because it doesn't want to look like we covered the windows.
Sam: True.
Liam: I've watched you pass through solid stone and earth. How long can you do that for?
Marisha: I mean, I can burrow us a tunnel right now.
Laura: Do it!
Liam: Can you get us close to underneath the tree?
Laura: That's what she's going to do.
Marisha: I'm going to do it right now. I'm going to cast Move Earth.
Laura: From the cellar.
Matt: You're going to start carving a tunnel--
Marisha: To the direction of the tree. And I want to be careful, I don't want to damage the roots of the tree at all. So, as I start getting closer, I want to start looking for the roots of the tree.
Matt: Okay. Easy enough to find old rags; all of them have that stale, musty towel scent to them. You get them a little wet. There's no water here; all the water here has dried out.
Sam: We use the wine.
Matt: You'll have to use the wine; it'll probably kill some of the bacteria. There are wells throughout the towns you see, ground wells that are set in the city. There is no nearby river. The closest river, the one you know about, is about a 30 minute walk south.
Taliesin: It's a bit of a ways.
Matt: Yeah. You use that to coax them out a bit. It's easy enough for you to go around and put cloth over the windows. It's a dark interior, so it's not like an immediate--
Taliesin: Just so light doesn't leak out.
Liam: But, just in case, I think I'll hang back. I'm not going down to the pre-made tunnel, I'll just keep an eye above ground.
Travis: I am, too, I'm staying up in the tavern.
Laura: I'm going with you to the tunnel.
Taliesin: I'm going to tinker a little thing. Can I borrow an arrow?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Thank you. I'm going to tinker a very little, easy thing.
Travis: You want the top floor, I'll take the bottom floor.
Taliesin: I want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow. So that I can--
Laura: Do you want me to shoot the arrow for you?
Taliesin: -- set a burn mark at a distance.
Matt: Interesting. Okay.
Taliesin: It would be a spark, as opposed to actual flame. It would just be concussive force.
Matt: Right, it's more getting the parchment there without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind, because it is a thin, flimsy piece.
Taliesin: It would be coiled.
Matt: Coiled and then--
Taliesin: Hit, release.
Matt: That's going to be a really intricate-- go ahead and roll a tinkerer's check.
Liam: 20, 20, 20.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Okay. You toy with it for a while; you think you have something that may work. You're uncertain as to on its release if it'll function or not. So, write down 'Parchment Delivery Arrow' with a question mark next to it.
Sam: Maybe there's a simpler way.
Taliesin: There might be, but just in case there's not, I want to make sure this works.
Marisha: You could always slap it up there and shoot it with a flame arrow.
Taliesin: I've got three of them, so I've got options. But I just want to make sure--
Marisha: How's my burrowing going? 200 feet.
Matt: All right. You continue to burrow through the ground, moving the earth aside and the tunnel opens before you like the clay slowly melting away. And it is wet earth. Eventually, you start getting to a few thick roots under the tree.
Laura: Can you talk to it from here, Keyleth?
Matt: The roots that you see, they continue past the tunnel. They go very, very deep into the ground.
Marisha: Awesome. I'm going to clear out a little more area, and I'm going to touch the roots and cast Speak with Plants.
Travis: Holy shit.
Sam: Speak with Plants?
Liam: Haroom haroom.
Taliesin: The only superpower more pathetic than Aquaman's.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Shut up.
Taliesin: Sorry, had to.
Laura: (kid's voice) Gee wiz, I wish I had some water.
Marisha: (kid's voice) The sun is so bright today!
Laura: Too bad we don't have Tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher.
Liam: It's Ent voice. Haroom haroom!
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Laura: Sure, sure, sure.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Sam: I can go to one of the wells and get some water.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: Hey, he's cool sometimes.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: Sometimes.
Taliesin: It's what fish say. Hi, Aquaman.
Marisha: That's what fish say.
Liam: That's all they say.
Taliesin: Hi, Aquaman.
Matt: You finish the spell and you reach out and you touch the root and you instill the force of your nature-based divine energies into the root. Silence.
Sam: Oh no.
Matt: This tree is dead.
Travis: No!
Sam: Dead?!
Laura: You can bring it back!
Marisha: I can bring it back. Should I?
Sam: You can do that?
Marisha: I'm a druid, that's my-- yeah man!
Sam: You can bring dead things back?
Marisha: Yeah, it's called Plant Growth!
Sam: What?!
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: This I gotta see.
Marisha: Should I? Okay. But it's dead. What time is it now?
Matt: Right now, with all the traveling you guys have done, I'd say it's past noon, probably. Including the time you've spent inside the tavern, searching it through and preparing it as your base of operations.
Laura: Try it.
Marisha: Should I start it up now?
Sam: Yeah!
Liam: Go for it!
Laura: Go for it!
Travis: Go for it!
Marisha: I'm going to start my Plant Growth. I'm going to drop. Can I try to clear out an area where I can-- I should be fine.
Laura: Reach up in its junk.
Taliesin: Put your hand in it.
Marisha: I'm going to strap on my gloves.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Turn and cough.
Marisha: Hope you guys are ready for this.
Sam: Is it going to be loud?
Marisha: No, it's just going to take a long time.
Travis: Vax and I are guarding the tavern, so if anything comes--
Sam: I'm going to get provisions ready to spoon-feed her.
Marisha: Actually, before I do that, can we all have one last meal together and eat a Heroes' Feast?
Laura: I like it.
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: Certainly.
Taliesin: Let's eat.
Matt: So, you've made the purchase within Emon for how many of the requisite chalice for the Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: How many did I buy?
Taliesin: You have at least one.
Marisha: It gets used. It's expensive.
Laura: It's $1000.
Marisha: It's $1000.
Matt: It's a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000 gold pieces, which the spell consumes. So, we'll say how many of those did you purchase in Emon, knowing you'd be casting this in the future?
Marisha: How much gold do we have?
Sam: Not a lot.
Laura: Is that for each person, or 1000 gold for the whole party?
Matt: For the whole feast.
Laura: How about you did three bowls?
Marisha: Three bowls.
Matt: Mark 3000 gold from the group's queue. And you have three gem bowls, using one now. So you have two bowls left at your disposal. And you prepare a Heroes' Feast for the group to consume.
Marisha: I take some of that leftover wine, use that to make it fancy wine.
Sam: This is great. This is awesome.
Laura: Are we eating in the cellar?
Marisha: So you get, I believe, 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points.
Sam: Wait, forever?
Laura: No, no, for how long?
Marisha: For 24 hours.
Matt: It lasts for 24 hours.
Sam: 2d12?
Matt: So, until about--
Sam: What the fuck is a d12? I've never rolled a d12.
Matt: -- 2PM tomorrow. So mark that down, somebody note that it lasts until 2PM.
Laura: An additional 2d12?
Matt: 2d10?
Marisha: Oh, I'm sorry, 2d10.
Taliesin: Damn it.
Laura: Overall hit points.
Marisha: And, you should have- Ooh! I got two tens!
Laura: Ah, badass!
Matt: Trinket can also benefit from this, by the way, too.
Laura: Yay! Nice.
Taliesin: You also get other bonuses.
Matt: Yep. You are immune to poison, and diseases, and being frightened, and all wisdom saving throws are made with advantage. Feast is awesome.
Sam: Why don't we do that right before we go see the Briarwoods, also?
Laura: We have another bowl.
Marisha: We have two more bowls.
Sam: Because that is fucking awesome.
Marisha: Doing that right now, just in case the Briarwoods decide to come say hello.
Taliesin: Or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible people in this town.
Travis: That was a delicious feast.
Sam: The tikka masala was tangy!
Marisha: So, we're immune to poison--
Matt: And disease and frightened. So, feast consumed, you now take your next eight hours--
Marisha: I'm going to go meditate. I'll be back in eight hours.
Matt: --to work on this. As she sits down to begin the ritual of cleansing, or bringing plant vitality enhancement to the vicinity of Whitestone. We're going to go ahead and end today's session there. Pick up at the end of that spell at the beginning of next week.
Taliesin: I love you all so much. I love you so much.
Matt: This is getting real interesting.
Marisha: What time is it?
Liam: It was like eight in the morning-ish when we found that building, yeah?
Matt: What?
Liam: Was it around eight in the morning when we got to that house?
Matt: You guys got to town around nine, 9 30.
Laura: So the spell probably started around 11.
Matt: Walking around, seeing things, finding the tavern. And then getting in there and cleaning it out. I'd say you're getting close to one, two o'clock now. You've also taken it slow, you're also being stealthy and not trying to be conspicuous as you move through.
Laura: Right, so we'll start the fight in the morning the next day.
Marisha: Well, I'm meditating now. I dropped into my meditation--
Sam: We're not starting any fight, we're forming an insurgency.
Marisha: Hopefully nothing happens and y'all don't have to defend me while I'm doing this shit. That's what I'm hoping for.
Taliesin: I have stuff to give you, too, 'cause, yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Man.
Taliesin: Thank you for letting me roll with that, by the way.
Matt: Of course. It fit right into my--
Taliesin: I had a funny feeling it would.
Matt: All right, guys. So we'll pick up from there next week, right in the center of the--
Marisha: A tree full of dead us? That's fucked up.
Laura: That's mean, Matt.
Taliesin: That was some mean shit, man.
Liam: That's what you call a giving tree.
Matt: It's a friendly place, Whitestone.
Sam: And the tree was happy. But not really.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, so that was it.
Matt: All righty. Well, I guess we have the announcements.
Zac: We have some donations.
Matt: Yeah, you guys are awesome.
Zac: And I wanna thank the chatroom for being on their best behavior tonight.
Laura: Thanks, guys.

Sam: The what?
Zac: They avoided the banhammer.

Zac: Another big charity cause tomorrow. Where you're on drums. So tomorrow the Battle of the Bands from 5-7PM. Your team, in case you don't know, is you, Felicia Day, Tom Lenk, and Josephine, one of our mods. See, Felicia was doing this thing where she was like, what team could I put together that will immediately win fan-favorite without doing any actual work? So we saw your plan, Felicia, and we came back with our team of Lucas, Mr. Spoopy in the back, running the tech board.
Matt: Heck yeah.
Zac: Augie, who is a professional drummer, Hector, and Amy Dallen, and we know, between Amy and Josephine, our chat room is definitely going to be split on who's the chat room favorite, so.
Matt: So is the professional drummer on bass?
Zac: No. Definitely not. He is not on bass.
Taliesin: You dropped Whitestone.
Zac: He is not on bass. Lucas is able to play all songs on Expert on guitar, I think you guys are gonna have your work cut out for you. For sure.
Matt: It's all good.
Zac: For sure. They also work here almost all week, and practice after all the shows. (laughs)
Matt: That's cool.
Taliesin: Is that what you do?
Matt: I prefer to light my opponents on fire while they're drumming, 'cause I find that's a good challenge for their skillset.
Zac: Oh, that would make sure a good show. I'm very okay with it. Like, let's go for it. It's for charity, let's just do it.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: I wanna say, we had a studio audience for this show as well, which we're very thankful for.
Matt: Yes we did, actually.
Marisha: Fellow critter! Alec!
Zac: Come on up real fast. Yeah.
Marisha: Go next to the DM!
Matt: Come here real fast!
Travis: Duck down low!
Matt: Come on down here and say hello.
Alec: What's up, Twitch chat? How you doing? These guys are exactly as awesome as you imagine them to be. I have to say, completely blown away. Absolutely blown away.
Laura: Oh, you.
Taliesin: Thanks for just stopping by. That was cool.
Marisha: Yeah. Yeah.
Matt: Seriously, man. Thank you so much.
Alec: Thanks for having me.
Matt: Of course, buddy. And guys, thank you all so much for tuning in. Hope you enjoyed it. We'll be back next week, Thursday. I guess we'll end here with a is it Thursday yet? Have a good night, guys.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everybody! Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and roll dice and play Dungeons & Dragons.
Travis: Yeah, we do.
Matt: My name is Matthew Mercer. I am the Dungeon Master of the show. Before we get started, let's go ahead and run through our announcements for the evening. First, I wanted to let you guys know that tonight-- tomorrow, I'm sorry. Tomorrow is the last day to preorder your Dagger Dagger Dagger shirt. Is it also the last day to do the Strongjaw Ale?
Laura: It is!
Matt: Strongjaw Ale and Dagger Dagger Dagger shirts.
Travis: Also ale.
Ashley: I need them!
Matt: You do need them.
Laura: You do. Actually, Ashley, I think I got shirts for you.
Matt: Yeah, we've got some shirts held for you.
Sam: Extra large!
Taliesin: But if you're not Ashley, you'd better get yourself a shirt.
Matt: Yep. So you have until tomorrow to get those, so go to the Geek and Sundry store to preorder if you're interested. Yay! Next up, a reminder, me and Marisha are flying out bright and early tomorrow morning to Pittsburgh for Tekko! We're going to be doing awesome panels on voiceover and gaming and all points nerdy on the Internet in between, as well as signings and autographs and all that fun stuff. So if you're in the area and you want to find a place that's warm, we'll be there in the convention, so hopefully we'll see you guys over the weekend.
Marisha: And I went to college there, so I'm going to be finding my old homies and getting drunk.
Taliesin: Do you have a college sweater that just says "college"? You could really use one.
Marisha: I went to the performing arts school, and we did make football t-shirts, because we thought it was funny, as our performing arts shirts.
Taliesin: That sounds like a performing arts joke.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Fascinating.
Matt: Indeed.
Marisha: Cool story, bro.
Matt: Next up, I get to announce, coming up as part of a celebration for International Tabletop Day and a sponsorship by Pathfinder and Syrinscape, who have been fantastic in getting this program for me in this game as well, we're going to be doing an event called "Critical Role One Shot" on April 18th, Monday, at 7 to 10 PM. We're going to be taking over Ivan's No Survivors slot that evening to run a Pathfinder one-shot that I'll be running. However, Ivan will actually be playing as a player in that one.
All: What?
Matt: I know! What, what? (gunshot) Mind blown. Destroyed. Ivan will be playing. We also will have guesting players of Taliesin and Marisha in that game as well, and we have two special guests that evening who will be playing with us: the illustrious Ashly Burch will be joining us for the evening, and the wonderfully talented Phil Lamarr as well.
Sam: Wait, what? I didn't know that.
Matt: Yeah! So it's going to be a fun night playing Pathfinder.
Laura: When is that, again?
Matt: That is April 18th, Monday at 7 PM, Pacific Time.
Travis: Aren't taxes due that day?
Matt: When you're done with your taxes, this is a great way to celebrate.
Marisha: A great way to celebrate. I'll be filing an extension, like everybody else.
Matt: It'll be a fun event, we've got some cool surprises set up for the story, and I'm excited about it, so come and join us 7 PM Pacific, Monday, April 18th for Critical Role One Shot. Also, those of you out there who are members of the Nerd Block, or are looking to be, this upcoming, now live, Nerd Block that is going out has a little surprise in there, a little artistic surprise for fans of Critical Role.
Sam: Oh? What is it?
Matt: They'll have to see.
Sam: Oh, a tiny poop. I'm in.
Laura: A teeny-tiny poop, just from Sam.
Matt: But yeah, those of you out there who want to check it out, we have a fun little insert there in the box. You get to see if you grab one, so check it out and see if it's to your liking. Liam, did you want to talk about--?
Liam: Oh, yeah, hey! You know my love for Wyrmwood Gaming and their boxes. We have these beautiful ones. Lift up a Wyrmwood box.
Laura: Oh! Oh my goodness.
Liam: They make great, beautiful boxes. They have all kinds of woods to hold your dice in, and if you use the code "critrole," you will get free shipping. But also, today, I would like to let you all know that Wyrmwood Gaming has a kickstarter for their Sentinel box. I'm sure I'm forgetting the actual name, but it's a beautiful box. It's good for D&D, it's good for Magic: The Gathering, and it holds cards, it holds dice, there's a Bluetooth in it so that if you lose it, you can find it.
Travis: Satellites can see it?
Laura: I wish we had the box in front of us, but go look it up, it's got this box on the top, and then it separates on the bottom and you can put your dice in the bottom.
Liam: It's called the Sentinel deck box. There's also a version of it called the Vox Machina, which is a premium item, and it's gorgeous.
Travis: Premium, premium, premium.
Liam: Premium. But tossing this out, too, if you guys want any of the other Sentinel deck boxes and you want to get the logo etched onto it, that's also an option. I don't know if it's on the site or not, but it will be.
Marisha: It's an off-the-menu item.
Laura: Yeah. Check it out!
Liam: 'Twill be there. Gorgeous box.
Ashley: That sounds like something Gilmore would sell.
Matt: There you go. Oh, he would. Don't worry. He would be happy to sell that.
Sam: And because of the Bluetooth feature, the NSA will track your every roll.
Marisha: You're now on the Homeland Security list.
Matt: All right. Do we have anything else you guys wanted to announce before we get started?
Travis: That fucking Rogue One trailer! Holy shit!
Taliesin: I haven't seen it yet!
Travis: All right. No words. No words. No words!
Sam: Is it like Batman vs. Superman good?
Taliesin: Don't set expectations you can't match.
Laura: Did you see it, Ashley?
Ashley: Yes! Gimme!
Travis: Yeah. All the things.
Matt: I'm sure it's cool. I haven't seen it yet.
Travis: Oh, on the break! On the break, on the break.
Laura: Yeah, we'll watch it on the break.
Matt: I haven't had a chance, I've been busy working on this shit for you guys!
Travis: What, you don't just make this stuff up as you go?
Matt: (mock weeping) No, I have to prepare.
Taliesin: It's imaginary, how could it be? You just flow with it. Right?
Marisha: Oh, I thought this was scripted.
Laura: I've been in rehearsal all day for this.
Sam: Hey, Wyrmwood crashed.
Liam: Wyrmwood crashed? Sorry, Wyrmwood. Or you're welcome, Wyrmwood.
Taliesin: I'm Instagramming my Wyrmwood box right now, too.
Travis: Well done. Well done, legion.
Sam: Colbert Nation.
Liam: I should say, the etching is a new development, so if that's not happening today, it'll be there tomorrow-ish.
Marisha: Yeah, so don't yell at them. Don't be like, "Bullshit!"
Travis: It's either going to be there tomorrow or very soon.
Laura: Because we literally got an email about it as we were starting.
Matt: Cool. All right.
Travis: Now we go to our deaths.
Matt: Now, we bring it back. I will ask if we could turn that speaker down a little bit. A little bit more. That's good. Great. All right, guys. Let's plug in to the world of Exandria, as we begin tonight's episode of Critical Role. So, last we left off, the adventuring party of Vox Machina, traversing the lands in search of lost artifacts of wars of old, referred to as the Vestiges of Divergence, in hopes of eventually tearing down and defeating a conclave of chromatic dragons called the Chroma Conclave that have destroyed society all across the continent of Tal'Dorei and beyond, you returned to the outskirts of a city named Westruun that was very important in your early adventures, to find it, from a distance, partially destroyed by the dragon attack but a couple weeks before, and since taken over by what seems to be the remnants, now swelling in power and size, of Grog's old herd of wandering barbarians and various savages. Having taken the city by force and ruling it with an iron hand, it was also deemed not the right time to face this foe, and as such the party continued venturing southward in the direction of the Frostweald, where somewhere at the base of the Stormpeak Mountains, the mate of Osysa, the gynosphinx you had met in Vasselheim-- her mate resides somewhere in this vicinity. That's all the information you have to go on as you head down towards the frozen forest. So. That's where we begin. As you guys continue pushing south from Westruun, seeing the distant pillars of dark smoke that slowly drift into the atmosphere disappear as the town itself vanishes over the horizon, you continue to push southward through the open grass fields. You continue traveling for the better part of a day, eventually coming up along the side of the Silvercut Channel, which is the river that comes down and cuts through near Kraghammer to the west of Westruun. It goes past Kymal and then eventually heads down in this direction, towards the Foramere Basin. You guys, travelling fairly quickly, as you're in your mist forms, which is making up a lot of the normal travel time you would have to worry about here, by the time the sun finally begins to set across the mountains-- pay attention, please.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Sorry.
Liam: It's another beholder!
Matt: I've got plenty of things I could throw in here if you guys aren't paying attention!
Taliesin: That's not funny.
Matt: No, it's really funny for me. As you guys continue pushing southward, as the sun slowly begins to set in the distance, you glance over towards the Foramere Basin. You can see, just over to the right, the city of Kymal, which has lights glimmering in the far distance. But what you see by the basin itself is this large lake that is centered in this region just north of the Frostweald. You can see where the two main rivers diverge before heading southward towards the ocean. There's a smattering of various tents that are clustered right towards the side of the riverbank and the edge of the lake itself. As you continue coasting overhead in your mist forms, you see small trails of smoke from smoldering campfires, clusters of people and families wandering the shore in this small group. You continue going forward?
Sam: I mean, we should check it out.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You don't have to, you can keep going.
Sam: It's a tent city?
Matt: It looks like it, yeah.
Laura: They're refugees, probably.
Sam: Hundreds, thousands?
Matt: There's probably a few dozen, close to maybe 50, 60.
Marisha: What do the tents look like? Do they look like military encampment tents, or refugee tents?
Matt: You can't really tell from this distance, especially as the light is beginning to slowly diminish.
Travis: Can we float closer?
Laura: We float down, we float down.
Sam: Oh, are we still mists?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Oh my God.
Travis: That whole description, and yes, we're still mists.
Matt: As you coast down closer, you get a better look, and yeah, there are about 50, 60 or so people on the outside. You don't have an idea of how many are inside the tents. Even more, most likely. But these tents are fairly ramshackle, barely standing, the people look destitute. They look like they're holding onto survival here on the outside of the city. You see a few boats that are going in and out on the shore, probably fishermen. There are a few bonfires that are now starting to kick up as the night's cold begins to swell in. It looks like this is a fairly "thriving," a fairly functional refugee camp.
Travis: Well, those that give a fuck, speak up.
Laura: We can't, we're in mist form.
Travis: Then like (hissing) in a direction.
Laura: (hissing) I think we should help them. Maybe we can --
Taliesin: (buzzing fart sound)
Sam: Good point.
Laura: Maybe we can send them back to Whitestone.
Taliesin: Maybe, if we could talk, which we can't right now.
Laura: I float down. Into the trees, outside of the camp.
Taliesin: I follow.
Matt: Okay. These are open grasslands, there aren't a lot of trees, and they're spotted around. There are a few rock formations and small hills, you might be able to get out of sight.
Laura: Around there.
Matt: So you coast around there and you go back into your physical form. The rest of you follow?
Travis: Tall grass? Low grass?
Matt: It's probably thigh-length.
Liam: Following.
Travis: Yeah, we go.
Matt: For you, close to the knee.
Laura: Near the rocks, so that we're in camouflage.
Matt: So you guys set down maybe 300 feet from the outside of the nearest part of the camp, reconstitute into your physical forms. At this point, the sun has now disappeared over the horizon and the blues have now gone to orange, to purple, and you can see in the distance the darkness of night is starting to crest over the sky. What do you want to do?
Travis: What are we stopped for? Are we here?
Laura: No, it looks like a refugee camp, Grog.
Taliesin: They may have information.
Laura: People that escaped from Westruun, potentially.
Travis: Oh, really?
Laura: Yeah. I mean, it's a large group of people, I'm assuming they came from a city of some sort.
Travis: Hey, Scanlan.
Sam: Oi.
Travis: If we go over there and it gets a little hairy, you've still got old magic door, right?
Sam: Old magic doll?
Travis: Hugh Hefner house!
Sam: Oh, yeah, magic door. Yes.
Travis: Magic doll if you have it, too, for later, but yeah.
Sam: I mean, I have a little Pike figurine that I keep with me.
Taliesin: Oh.
Sam: What, no, it's a keepsake!
Travis: Yeah, I'm sure it is.
Sam: Why is everything I say creepy?
Liam: I don't know, why is it?
Laura: Maybe we should pop them back to Whitestone. I feel like it might be good, if we find out if they're hurting. That's where we're putting our survivors.
Liam: They look like they're hurting.
Marisha: I couldn't help with that today.
Laura: Oh. We could rest overnight, and you could pop them in in the morning?
Marisha: What time is it?
Liam: It's late. Sun's gone down.
Travis: Super late. Yeah, and if they're from Westruun--
Laura: Are you out of all your-- oh, mist form.
Marisha: Mist form got us here.
Taliesin: It's worth talking to them at the very least.
Travis: Yeah, Pike and I are from Westruun. If they're of that village, or that city, I'd like to make sure they're all right.
Marisha: Maybe they're friends.
Laura: Maybe we'd find Pike's grandfather.
Travis: Grandfather Wilhelm.
Laura: Percy, would Whitestone be able to sustain this many more people?
Taliesin: I think at some point we're going to have to have that conversation, but for now I think we'll probably be all right.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: All right.
Travis: You're good for it. You're rich.
Taliesin: For now.
Liam: Here's an idea. Scanlan, you said that a lot of people can go into your house, yeah?
Sam: I can fit many people into my hole.
Liam: Could you-- (laughs)
Marisha: I wonder why everything he says is creepy.
Liam: Could you invite the folk in, and then they live in your hole for a little while, and then when we get to Whitestone, you open your hole and out they come?
Sam: No, not quite.
Marisha: That's some cartel shit right there.
Travis: Yeah. We become "Vox Machina  Coyotes."
Liam: Scanlan is the mule.
Sam: No, the house is mainly for us and a few guests, for one night at a time.
Laura: You can't, like, leave them there.
Liam: Didn't you say 100 people, the other day?
Sam: 100 servants are in there. I don't quite-- I haven't jammed people in there. I don't know how many it can totally hold.
Marisha: You mean, you've never thrown a party?
Matt: Go ahead and roll an intelligence check
Sam: First roll of the night  Natural 20! (cheering)
Sam: Wasted it on an intelligence check. (laughter)
Travis: Smile upon us, dice gods!
Matt: Though the magic is new to you, you've spent in your first time casting it and a large part of the evening, especially since you realized you weren't going to have as fun a night as you thought, after the broom had been taken and Vex left your room, learning the intricacies of the spell itself and the pocket dimension that is created. You can fit quite a few people in there. However, it is stationary in its entrance and exit and then once the spell comes to completion after a 24-hour period, it expels anyone and anything that was brought into it, on the spot where it was originally cast.
Liam: I see.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Like gently, or like--
Sam: Like a flush.
Travis: Like (sweetly) "Please leave." or like (angry) "Get the fuck out!"
Liam: Is that a yes or a no?
Sam: It's not a transporting-type spell. It is a temporary shelter, at best.
Liam: You just don't want to bring them in.
Sam: I have a cold, cold heart. (laughter)
Sam: Listen, I'll consider taking the females in.
Travis: That is very noble of you.
Laura: So noble, Scanlan.
Travis: I will join him in this charity.
Laura: Oh, yes.
Marisha: Well, all right, why don't we just walk around and talk to these people? Maybe they're not even interested in being transported. Let's just find some citizens around.
Laura: Should we make sure they're actually innocent, nice people?
Marisha: We should probably do that as well, not like a band of thieves. Bandits.
Laura: Stealth ahead.
Travis: That could be fun.
Laura: Can I sneak ahead and just listen to them?
Sam: Yes, sneaking up on them will definitely put them on our side.
Laura: Hey, like 100 yards out. I just want to hear what they're saying.
Sam: All right, all right.
Liam: She can read lips so she doesn't even get that close.
Laura: It's pretty dark, though. But I do have good darkvision.
Matt: This is true. As the night takes over, it's still quite a distance to be able to make out a lot of detail. You'd probably have to get closer. But you're going alone?
Travis: No, twins.
Matt: Twins going together?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Why don't you both roll a stealth check?
Liam: Oh, I guess I'm going then.
Taliesin: I'm keeping an eye also, to see if anything-- From a great distance, I'm just keeping an eye out.
Laura: We're in the woods, right?
Matt: No. You are in the plains.
Sam: There are no woods, tall grasses
Laura: Just kidding, we're in the grasslands.
Liam: Grass, grass. 32.
Travis: I'll roll this big bastard.
Taliesin: White manna, not green manna.
Laura: 18.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'm hiding in a tree.
Matt: There's no-- (annoyed hmm)
Laura: There's no-- (laughter)
Travis: "There's no (grumbles)"
Sam: The grass to me is like a tree
Matt: This is true, actually. It's more of a rose bush. So as you guys push forward, pushing and stalking through the grass, you come to about 40, 50 feet outside. And there's a little bit of chatter, it's hard to make out at this distance but the people seem to, not necessarily be jovial. Almost like they've accepted the circumstances and are just surviving it for the time being. There are a few individuals that are armed, though the armor itself seems patchwork, or you know, not the best or most trained of individuals currently guarding this group of survivors. But there are patrols going around, people keeping a close look, there are torches being lit now as people begin walking--
Laura: Do we see anyone that we recognize from Westruun?
Matt: Not from this distance.
Laura: No.
Matt: With your darkvision you can make out the outline of the very, very nearest individuals, the guards in particular. But at this distance, nobody catches your eye that you'd be able to make out much detail on, that you would recognize.
Liam: Can we just sit for five or ten minutes?
Laura: Well, the guards are coming through with torches, I don't want them to find us and think we're spies.
Liam: But we are.
Laura: Yeah, but I don't want them to think that.
Liam: But we are.
Laura: Yeah. I think you can stay 'cause you're more hidden than I am. I'm going to go back to the group.
Liam: All right.
Laura: I feel like they're going to see me.
Liam: All right.
Matt: (chuckling) You don't know that. As far as you know, you're so hidden.
Laura: "I'm so hidden." Shit.
Travis: Come on.
Laura: All right, all right, all right. Just a second.
Liam: I'm just going to stay here for a couple of minutes longer. Wait, you said they were coming our direction or they're just-- ?
Matt: No, they're just wandering. Just patrolling
Laura: Oh all right.
Liam: You're paranoid!
Laura: Okay, fine fine fine fine.
Liam: Let me listen for a bit.
Matt: Okay. I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.
Liam: All right. 22.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay. You two, at about the same time, focus best you can. You have to scoot a little bit closer once the guard that's nearest to you passes by. You wait for your moment, scoot up close, get by one of the tents, and look off to the side. There are a few folks that catch your attention a little bit. There's one that was Elowen Brist, who was the mother of the first child that went missing in Westruun. You see her, with her daughter who's a little bit older now that you guys helped save her.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Liam: All these throwbacks are blowing my mind.
Matt: A little dirty but alive. They wander off. You scan through the crowd, keeping an eye out for the guard as well. No one really catches your attention. You see one older gentleman that walks by, 60s, not completely withered away. But, you know, older but carries himself with much importance. Very expensive clothing, reds and blues. It seems like he's attempting to hold a social station, even though in his current location, society has crumbled. He doesn't really catch your attention as anyone you recognize, but the person to the left of him is a very familiar-looking elven man, with long brown hair slicked over and behind his ears. This is Drez Vina, who originally contacted you when you arrived in Westruun.
Laura: Holy-- (whispers) That's Drez Vina!
Liam: Yeah, yeah.
Matt: He's looking a little rough, too. This has not been the kindest time to any of these people.
Laura: Well, should we go back to the group or tell them to come on in?
Liam: Do we have to go back to tell them to come on in?
Laura: We have earrings.
Liam: Well, yeah, that's true
Laura: (whispering) Hey, you guys.
Travis: What?
Sam: What, what what what what?
Laura: You guys! Hey Percy, pay attention.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, yes. Hello. What?
Laura: Hey, guess who I'm looking at right now?
Taliesin: Your brother.
Laura: Well--
Sam: God, you're so good at that.
Laura: Drez fucking Vina
Marisha: (gasps) Drez!
Sam: Wait, remind us, who-- ?
Laura: Drez Vina was that dude that sent us on our very first mission together, you guys.
Taliesin: Ooh.
Marisha: Yeah! He protected us, he's a magic user.
Sam: Oh. I was mostly drunk that time.
Laura: Yeah, Percy you weren't there yet.
Taliesin: Oh, at the Winter's Crest festival, I remember.
Matt: (laughing) That's not him at all.
Liam: No. He was-- Drez Vina.
Travis: "That's not it at all." (chuckles)
Laura: Percy, you weren't there--
Matt: That's Abjurist Noja.
Marisha: Oh. Abjurist Noja.
Taliesin: Oh. Abjurist Noja.
Liam: Drez Vina was the dick. Drez Vina's a dick.
Laura: Drez Vina's the guy. Drez Vina was the asshole.
Sam: Doesn't he work for someone else?
Matt: He had a Master.
Marisha: Wait, was he the guy that we stole from, kind of?
Laura: Hey, keep it down. I don't know who all can hear over these earrings!
Travis: Oh, did he have the tower with the magical items?
Matt: Here, I should step in here and clarify-- (laughter)
Marisha: It's been like three years.
Liam: This was only three years ago.
Matt: No, I know. Drez Vina came to you under the pretense that he was working for an individual called the Master, he called him his Master, who was interested in hiring your services. Originally sent you into the mage tower of Eskil Ryndarien, the Realmseer, to steal the brass box with the pearl top. However, you did not steal it and instead you ended up befriending the Archmage.
Travis: He let us pick something.
Matt: Yes, he let you pick something from his array of items.
Sam: That's right!
Matt: Drez then found you guys at your inn, a number of weeks later. And Drez was very unhappy that you both didn't return with the item, and used a very powerful and expensive object that was part of this endeavor, and never paid it back. So, to pay back your debt, he sent you guys to the Druid Barrow where you had to retrieve this cortex, this magical gem that was embedded in the center of--
Marisha: And that was where we fought the golem!
Matt: Yep. Where you fought the golem. And you retrieved the cortex successfully, and that's the last you've seen of him.
Laura: See? He likes us now! We totally helped him.
Sam: But he has magical items--
Laura: Well, maybe not anymore.
Sam: Had. Well, we should--
Liam: What was, DM, can you remind me the name of the mother that we spoke to all that time ago?
Laura: The one you just mentioned.
Matt: Elowen.
Liam: Elowen? Elowen. I'd rather go talk to her.
Matt: I'm pretty sure, let me check my notes. Yeah, Elowen. Elowen Brist.
Laura: Do you guys want to just come on in?
Sam: Yes, let's go in.
Taliesin: I don't see what the harm is.
Travis: We go in.
Laura: Make a nice, pleasant chattering-- maybe you should sing, Scanlan, as you approach so that people know we're nice
Sam: I would love to sing. Oh. Right now? (singing) Sunny days, chasing the dragons away, On our way to where the air is clean, Can you tell me how to kill, How to kill some drag-eens?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance check.
Matt: Yes.
Laura: What is it? What is it?
Sam: It fell off the table. And it is-- a six. But plus 13.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Wait-- plus 14.
Matt: Plus 14? Okay. Okay, so, as you guys begin strolling up, immediately you see torches (fire sounds).
Liam: Hands up. No weapons.
Matt: You see guards come forward, two of them with nocked crossbows. "Who goes there?"
Laura: Hey, you guys!
Matt: And they don't really recognize-- they're all looking at this source of singing. Crossbows--
Sam: (singing) It's a magic carpet ride. Except we burned our magic carpet so we can't-- (laughter)
Matt: The guards slowly drop their crossbows. "What's your business?"
Travis: Hey, hey, that's not necessary. We're friends.
Matt: "We've already got enough mouths to feed. Move along."
Travis: No, we're not looking for food. We're here to provide aid if we can, if it's in need, if people need our help.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Sam: Persuasion? You?
Laura: Grog--
Travis: Ten.
Matt: While their crossbows are notched, they haven't lowered them completely, they're still on guard and still nervous of your approach.
Liam: We also think there's a woman with you named Elowen. She knows us. We'd like to speak to her. We'll wait here.
Matt: One of them glances over at the other one. One of the guards who was paying attention walks away and they all raise their crossbows again and just train them on you guys for the next few minutes.
Travis: I mean, it's really not necessary. Even if you were to loose those, it would just be a tickle. I mean, trust me, we come from Westruun, all right?
Laura: Don't you remember us? In Westruun?
Travis: Yeah. Winter's Crest festival?
Laura: Vox Machina?
Travis: Grog? Pike? Wilhelm?
Matt: One of the guards takes a moment and gives you an eye and just goes-- "I remember seeing you around town. You were-- Oh man, jeez, it's good to see you."
Travis: Right? I'm as psyched about all this--
Matt: "Sorry if I gave you any trouble back in the day. I was young and stupid."
Sam: Why don't you all lower your crossbows, for a second?
Matt: "I mean no offense, but we're very guarded with your kind at the moment."
Travis: (inhales) Right. Yeah, yeah, understandable. Right. We just actually came from Westruun. It seems to be a bit occupied at the moment.
Marisha: And he's with us. So-- He's not with them. LAURA. He's different than the other guys, see? He's got a beard.
Travis: No, I, listen. It came about my own. I just got the genetics for it. (stage-whispers) Would you shut up?
Matt: At which point the guard that had left comes back with Elowen. She walks up with her tightly braided reddish hair with a little bit of grey on the sides, that probably has come since the last time you've seen her and the experience of having her child gone so long. It's taken a physical toll on her. But there is a smile on her face. Now she looks over and focuses her eyes--
Liam: Elowen!
Matt: "That's them! That's them! Let them in, let them in." And she runs forward immediately and gives a big hug to you, Vex.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: And starts moving through, and, you know, just this big smile and surprise. And you can see her little boy Simon come up to the side.
All: Oh! Simon!
Matt: Simon, who last time you saw, you were retrieving him from the pocket dimension that the Dread Emperor had called his domain. At which point, there's a few quick pleasantries, as she says hello again. She says: "Please, please come in. Please. It's fine. They're trustworthy." And the guards nod. And they follow behind, not in an aggressive way but just in a being-careful kind of way. So you have two people, two armed individuals flanking you the entire walk that you guys are doing, but it's at ease.
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to Simon.
Matt: "Hi!"
Marisha: How old are you now?
Matt: "This many-- " He puts up nine fingers.
Marisha: You've grown up so well.
Matt: "Thank you."
Marisha: And I just give him a big hug.
Matt: He freezes up. He's gotten a little shy at the interaction.
Liam: I kneel down next to him and I say  do you want to see something cool? Look at this. And I take off the serpent belt. And-- (snake hisses)
Sam: Oh, Jesus.
Liam: And I put him around my neck. I named him after you. (laughter)
Matt: "Really?"
Liam: He's my pet. Do you want to, he's gentle as a lamb. Do you want to tickle his neck?
Matt: "Yes." (laughter)
Liam: Yeah. Here, you hold him. I set it down around his neck. Don't worry. Nothing's going to happen. It's fine.
Matt: He locks up again. Snakes and women have the same reaction to this poor little boy.
Liam: Simon, fart in his ear. Go ahead and fart in his ear.
Matt: He gives you a stern look. And the snake just wraps around him for a second.
Marisha: Keyleth does a little wind gust and goes (poof).
Matt: He goes (giggles) and starts laughing. Reaches up and rubs his ear from the tickle.
Liam: It's good to see you again, kiddo. Come here, Simon Jr. I'll put him back, now.
Matt: He has a big smile on his face now. "That's so cool."
Laura: While that was happening, I pulled aside his mother. Is this everyone that made it out of Westruun?
Matt: (sighs) "Well, we're one group. Many went to Kymal, but they're at capacity now, and based on many of the farming fields that were destroyed or burned by the dragon ransacking, there's only so much food to go around, so they had to turn us away. But there were some small farming communities along the river that were kind enough to take us in and we're... we're getting by."
Laura: But you're searching for a home?
Matt: "Hoping to find out if anything takes care of the problems in Westruun. You should probably talk to Cornelius. I don't know the details of everything happening."
Laura: Cornelius. Is he the man I saw in the finer robes?
Matt: "No, no. Cornelius is rather-- he's not very well-dressed. He--" And she scratches her head. "He used to be the bookbinder in Westruun but when everything fell apart, he rose up and took the lead in keeping everyone safe and so, I mean, he won't say it, but we kind of look to him as a leader for now."
Laura: Did he work in the Cobalt Reserve?
Matt: "I think he did business with them, but I don't think he worked directly with."
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: "Here. Let me take you."
Laura: Oh, wonderful.
Matt: She walks over and, as you guys are talking to Simon, she scoops Simon up and pulls him to her side and gives you guys a smile of acknowledgement. "Come," and leads you guys--
Laura: We're meeting Cornelius.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: (softly) Who's Cornelius?
Laura: He's a bookbinder.
Travis: Never heard of him.
Matt: You guys are led through. Most of the folks stop what they're doing and pay attention. Some look wary and guarded. Others, you see their faces brighten up as they begin to connect the dots between the whispers they've heard of Vox Machina throughout the landscape and the individuals walking through. Most everyone seems to have a somewhat visceral emotional reaction once Grog passes by. It does catch you. You know, as a person who has always stuck out against the society as it was, and you've worked hard to a degree to get some respect, especially in that city. Having so many eyes on you, and you can feel the, while unearned from your standpoint, the heaps of hatred that are thrust upon you by how you look right now is uncomfortable. Eventually, the guards and Elowen bring you guys up to a central tent around what looks like a larger bonfire in the center where a lot of people are starting to bring their big nets of fish over and starting to divvy it out and set up small cooking arrangements so that people for the evening can have their dinner. She walks up to the edge of tent, speaks to one of the guards, mentions you guys and your wanting to talk to Cornelius. The guard leans in, shouts off to the side, "Cornelius, you've got some visitors. Is that okay?" A voice muffles through, "That's fine. Go ahead and let them in." The guard pulls open the tent, and at this point Elowen says, "I'm going to go get my son some food. If you need anything, just ask around."
Liam: We'll see you again.
Matt: "Thank you guys, again." She rubs Simon's head and walks off. And as she walks off with him, he keeps looking over his shoulder at you the whole time, with a big smile on his face. You guys walk into the tent, and it smells like a tent that's been lived in for a couple weeks. The interior's not fancy by any means. It's blankets and burlap, and whatever functions to guard against the relatively muddy shores of the river. And you get a sense that most places here, just because of the landscape and how close it is to the river, mud is tracked everywhere. So it's mostly caked ground. There is a small cot on the far edge and there is a table set up and some elements of dried fish that are just being pulled from a sack on the side. And there are two guards, and you can see what appears to be Cornelius coming to greet you, as you enter. A man in his mid-40's, blondish hair with a scruffy, unkempt beard. You get the sense that he's a working man. His hands look calloused. He's got a layer of just dirt and grime across his brow that tells you he's definitely one who gets in the thick of it when it's needed. And you can see why in this circumstance people put trust into a person that can rise up amongst all the chaos from simple means and prove themselves to want to help everybody. And in the moment he smiles, you immediately see also why people follow him. He's got this bright, toothy, white smile, and he puts his hand out immediately to each of you. "Pleasure to meet you. I'm Cornelius."
Laura: Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "So, I'm told that you all are here to talk to me? What's this about?"
Sam: We know that you've been driven out of your homes by an attack of dragon or dragons. How many have menaced your city?
Matt: "Well, counts all say that we have upwards of three dragons that came through here and tore into this city and-- They were gone for a while, and we'd hoped they weren't going to return, but that's when--" He kinda looks over to you, Grog. "That's when the savages came in and took what was left. And I mean no offense to that. I recognize you; I've seen you around the town before. You seem like you're not like your ilk."
Travis: No. No, I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.
Matt: "That's okay. No one really knows who I am and I want to keep it that way, when all this blows over."
Travis: Understandable.
Matt: "Don't like all the attention."
Taliesin: How long have you been nomadic for?
Matt: "We're going into our second week now, I think. We sent a few of our most able-bodied up north in hopes of trying to figure out if the city was safe to return to, and, well, only a few made it back, and those that did said it was a bloodbath."
Laura: It's quite dangerous there right now.
Matt: "Yeah."
Travis: How many do you have here, in your encampment with you?
Matt: "Let's see." He kind of takes a moment to think and does couple marks on the dirt in front of him to do a count. You can see he's not a very numbers-guided person.
Travis: I like him. (laughter)
Matt: "I'd say we got probably about close to 60, 70 people left. We used to have more. Then we lost the scouting parties up north and, well, these past four days we've had a few of these orcish fuckers been raiding the outskirts of our camp every night and taking goods, people--"
Marisha: What's your current destination?
Matt: "Hah, we got none. We're just staying here and staying alive."
Marisha: And what made you camp out here?
Matt: "Fish, mainly. I mean, all the farming grounds are destroyed or they're being guarded currently, and there's no space for us in Kymal. We can keep going east, but--"
Travis: If I could be selfish for a moment. Have you seen Wilhand? Pike, Pike Trickfoot. Her grandfather.
Laura: A small, older gnome?
Matt: "We got a few older gnomes from the city. I don't think we have any among us though, no."
Travis: Fine. Thought I'd ask.
Liam: If we could help you relocate quite a ways away, would you be open to that?
Matt: "How do you mean?"
Laura: There's a city. A lot of the refugees from other cities that have been destroyed by the dragons are finding their way there and--
Marisha: Percy actually has family who's in charge there.
Laura: We could give you safe passage.
Taliesin: Possibly find you someplace to work.
Laura: Very quick, safe passage.
Marisha: Can they account for 70 extra people in Whitestone?
Taliesin: We lost a lot during the attack with the Briarwoods.
Marisha: Right.
Taliesin: There's room, but there's only-- We can maybe make room for a few more.
Laura: There's farmland, there are some empty buildings.
Matt: "I appreciate the offer, and--"
Marisha: It hasn't been touched by dragons yet.
Matt: "Hah. 'Yet.'"
Marisha: Yet.
Matt: "I tell you what. We greatly appreciate the offer, and we're liable to take you up on that at some point in the near future. But right now, we have too many of our people that are unaccounted for to the south. We got a couple scouting groups who're trying to find out where these orcs are, where they've taken them. See if we can retrieve our own before we go ahead and find a new place to live."
Sam: How many are missing right now?
Matt: "Well, we lost 11 in the last few nights of exchange, to blade, and we've lost about nine to the actual bands themselves, so. There's nine unaccounted for. We're hoping--"
Sam: If we found them, would you be more likely to take your people to somewhere safe?
Marisha: And what is necessarily stopping you from at least sending a handful of women and children ahead? Families that don't need to be nomadic.
Matt: "Do you have the means to keep them safe for that kind of travel? That's a long way, up to Whitestone. We don't have the guards to keep them up on that."
Laura: We have very safe means of travel.
Taliesin: A shortcut, one would say.
Marisha: They'd be there in an instant.
Matt: "I don't know anything about any of that weird magic stuff, but you seem like a reliable group."
Liam: You can tell we're a motley bunch of assholes. We've seen shit and we've done shit and we can do shit.
Matt: "Ain't that the truth. Well--"
Taliesin: We'd also like to talk to you, perhaps, to see if you've seen some shit. We're actually looking for something out here.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: Are we?
Taliesin: We are. Well, you've been travelling, we're looking for a creature who may have what we need to help defeat these dragons.
Laura: Possibly a bit deeper into the Frostweald.
Matt: "Into the Frostweald?"
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: "That's where we're thinking our scouts are saying these orcs are holed up, anyway."
Laura: Really?
Taliesin: That's useful.
Matt: "At least, that's where we've been sending our folk. And follow them out there. Only one group went in after them and they never came back, so--"
Marisha: No one's returned who's come back?
Matt: "Oh, we've gotten one group that came back. That's how we know they're there. But they were just a scouting party. They got to the outskirts and came back."
Marisha: Can we speak to them?
Matt: "I think they're out right now, actually. Going to get more information. Sorry."
Taliesin: Well, that works out well, then. We can go up that direction, perhaps take care of this problem, possibly.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: It's on the way.
Travis: I wouldn't mind a good stretch.
Laura: Kill some orc.
Taliesin: I could use some breathing.
Marisha: Do you know your way around the Frostweald at all?
Matt: "Can't say I do. But I do have some stake in this personally, if you don't mind me asking. We don't have much to offer you, at all, really, other than my gratitude. Tell of a few friends of ours that've found their way wherever these savage creatures are stationed. One of the individuals that was taken in a raid two nights ago was my brother, Cyrus. Don't know if he's still amongst the living, but if you are indeed planning on taking a look at where these orcs are and bring folks back safe, if you could just keep an eye out for him?"
Liam: Well, I'll tell you, in times like these, it will feel good to be able to do a bit of good.
Taliesin: Hear, hear.
Laura: What does your brother look like?
Matt: "He's about 15 years younger than me. Shaggy brown hair, bit of a puffy goatee. He looks like a lazy man. He is a lazy man, but I love him. If you're looking for someone who's hiding in the corner, shaking in their boots, it's probably him."
Laura: Understood.
Travis: Check the corners.
Matt: "It's his defense mechanism."
Laura: (laughs) A very safe one.
Matt: "I hope." His eyes go a little colder at that moment. "I hope."
Laura: Well, we've been to the Frostweald before. I'm not afraid to go in there again.
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: I say we take the evening to rest, and first thing in the morning, head out.
Laura: Would there be any injured members of your camp that would want to head out in the morning to Whitestone? Somebody that needs any medical attention?
Matt: "We've got plenty of folks who aren't feeling too well. Illness and disease, unfortunately, tend to go hand-in-hand with these type of nomadic lifestyles. We can probably-- about seven or eight people that could use some relatively immediate attention. Couple survivors of the recent raids. If you can indeed do this, you might be saving some lives, here."
Marisha: Are we camping the rest of the night?
Taliesin: Yes.
Liam: That's wise.
Travis: Yeah, we promise you no one will bother you tonight.
Marisha: Question. Question. Can I do my Transport via Plants as a ritual cast to not burn a slot level?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: That's what I thought.
Matt: It would say it next to the spell. Ritual.
Marisha: That's what I thought. Okay. Keyleth spends the rest of the evening burning up my remainder spell slots to do curing on those who need it.
Matt: Okay. You guys are given a relatively ramshackle tent in which you can sleep for the evening, cooked fish-- that's about all they have to offer-- with a few leftover potatoes that appear to have been recently either located amongst their remaining crates, you have no idea, but a passable meal is presented if you'd like, and a place that has cloth over your head.
Travis: No, I don't need to sleep tonight. I'll be on the watch.
Sam: Boy. (laughter)
Laura: Should we scour the camp for her grandfather?
Taliesin: I'm sleeping tonight. I don't know what's wrong with him.
Laura: I know he said there were no gnomes, but--
Travis: There's only 60 people. I feel like he'd know with 60.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: That's like this many, like--
Liam: And it's not a lot of gnomes. I'm assuming it's a handful of gnomes.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Right. I just, I don't know. I wish Pike were here.
Travis: Yeah, me too.
Liam: Always wish Pike was here.
Matt: You do recall, last time you were in Whitestone, you left the other half of your gatestone with Pike.
Taliesin: I'll write a letter.
Marisha: We'll write a letter.
Taliesin: I'll write a letter that will travel with them to Whitestone and--
Sam: Oh.
Marisha: Ooh, that's a good idea.
Laura: That's wonderful, and she can pop over.
Taliesin: Mm-hm. Take about a minute.
Travis: Really?
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Wait, we'd have to send them tonight, though.
Taliesin: No, in the morning.
Laura: They could go in the morning and just go find her immediately.
Marisha: Yeah, could task someone to find her immediately and then, as soon as she gets the message, she'll beam to us.
Sam: All right.
Liam: I've still got the other one. Right here.
Travis: Great. We take the night, then.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I write a letter to my sister, letting her know that I do apologize that we're sending more people, but it's necessary, and I write her a letter insisting that Pike be sent here by stone immediately.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: (singing) D-E-A-R C-A-S-S, how are you? I'm fine.
Laura: What the fuck are you singing?
Taliesin: (singing) Everybody else is too!
Liam: Wow! You know what I'm doing!
Travis: Holy shit, what the fuck just happened?
Laura: What was that?
Taliesin: You are a nerd!
Liam: A theatre nerd, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, you are a theatre nerd.
Laura: Wow.
Liam: Secret Garden, ladies and gentlemen.
Taliesin: Secret Garden  The Musical. It's magical.
Liam: Can we have the break so Taliesin and I can go make out in the other room?
Matt: Don't go on break for that! Just move your seating arrangement.
Taliesin: And suddenly the YouTube hits just go through the roof. (laughter)
Sam: What injured people are going back? Have we met these people yet? Can we meet them?
Matt: You haven't met them, no.
Laura: Let's go find the injured.
Matt: You guys are led with Keyleth as well. There are two armed guards that are hobbling their way through their patrols tonight as they've been wounded in the previous orc raid that happened the couple nights beforehand. There are a number of just relatively sick people. Couple of children. Whether it be having to eat whatever was around to stay alive but some of the food had spoiled in travel, or just catching disease as when you have clusters of people in cold environments, especially cold, wet environments like this tonight. It does tend to happen. Nothing seriously life-threatening, but, you know, definitely worrisome.
Sam: I try to find the one who's the most able-bodied. Right? We're going to need someone to go find Pike or deliver a message, right?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: It's going to be whoever's organizing it.
Sam: Is someone going who's not injured to transport these people?
Matt: Possibly. And you can organize whoever you'd like. Someone you know, you could bring along.
Marisha: Well, I start attending to the children first.
Matt: Okay. So you tend to the children, helping them feel comfortable, deal with any wounds, scrapes, relative inconveniences, and it's easy enough for you to take a moment to cure disease if need be.
Laura: Can we find any families with children and maybe see if there's able bodies in there that we could send through?
Matt: Okay. Yeah, you manage to-- and with Elowen and her son Simon as well--
Laura: Yes. Maybe Elowen could go?
Taliesin: Elowen would be perfect.
Marisha: Well, remember, we were able to get about 25 or so people through last time with the spell.
Laura: How many sick people are there?
Matt: You see about seven or eight people that could use it.
Laura: Perfect.
Matt: So you can get a bunch of other folks through as well.
Marisha: Okay.
Laura: I talk to Elowen and ask if she can go find Pike in the morning, if she wants to go through, and all that kind of stuff.
Matt: "I'd be happy to, I--"
Sam: You remember what Pike looks like?
Matt: "Yeah. About your size, lightish hair--"
Sam: Hair the color of the sunset, eyes like waves that crash in the night, breasts, supple, firm--
Travis: Okay, Scanlan. Scanlan.
Ashley: True, true, true. (laughter)
Matt: "Right. Yes, I remember. I'll find her, yes."
Sam: Smell of morning dew as it touches--
Matt: She begins to cover Simon's ears. (laughter)
Matt: "All right, I think we should turn in for the evening, but yes, I'll be happy to take care of it."
Liam: Also of note, you're going to be going through a tree.
Matt: "What?"
Liam: Just go with it. You're going to be--
Marisha: Well, you know, you didn't have to tell them that now. Could've just let it be a surprise.
Laura: It's really fun, actually.
Liam: It's kind of frightening, though, if you don't know it's coming.
Laura: You'll pop right out in Whitestone. It's amazing.
Liam: It's still a little weird for me, to be honest.
Marisha: Is it? Okay, that's good to know.
Matt: "All right. All right." So, as the evening comes to completion, you're taking guard for the course of the evening.
Laura: I pop Trinket out and I sleep on him.
Travis: Very attentive.
Matt: (bear sound) He curls up.
Laura: Hugs and hugs.
Matt: Yeah. Warm, fuzzy. Trinket makes for a very good bed for one.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to curl into the butt end, which is all I get. All I ever got while we were traveling.
Laura: Yeah. He farts on you all the time.
Liam: I fart on him all the time.
Matt: It's just a fart exchange. Back and forth, forever.
Liam: Bada-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang-lang.
Matt: (laughs) That got weird. Did you want to do anything for the evening?
Travis: No.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh boy.
Liam: Oh crud. Big two!
Travis: Big watch, big watch. Nine!
Laura: Ey-oh!
Liam: Ey-oh! (exploding sounds)
Matt: Okay. All right. The evening goes by without a hitch. (groans)
Laura: What would you have seen? What would you have seen?
Matt: You all come to consciousness. You eventually get your rest as well for the evening.
Marisha: What didn't you see? Tell me what you didn't see.
Matt: At this point, the tent city is back to a bustling sound of folks going about their business for the day, what kind of business that can be done. The people that you've requested be sent over to Whitestone have been gathered on the outside, the western side of this small city area, and some of the guards there are prepared to greet you in preparation for sending these people over.
Sam: Keyleth, before we do this, there are no trees here.
Marisha: What? What do you mean? Are there trees here?
Matt: No. It's a plain. I mean, there are the occasional small tree, scattered in clusters around, but you're in the grasslands.
Marisha: I thought we were on the edge of a forest.
Sam: There's no forest here.
Matt: The forest is south of you guys.
Laura: We've got to walk them to the forest.
Marisha: How fucking far are trees?
Matt: I'd say, probably--
Sam: Four days' journey.
Matt: No, from this area, it's most of a day's travel. There are trees closer, but the forest is that far.
Marisha: I just need a tree to fit people through. I need a person-width tree.
Sam: A giant tree.
Matt: To find a tree large enough to do this is probably going to be about two hours' walking distance.
Laura: Okay, we can walk for two hours.
Marisha: That's a nice morning hike.
Laura: You know what, I'm going to fly up. I'm going to (hacking spit) and fly up and find a fucking tree.
Sam: Oh, you're going to scout?
Laura: I'm going to scout for a tree.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: Why did you pick that as the word?
Laura: I didn't think about it. I forgot.
Taliesin: That was a great decision.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. You find, actually, hiding just around the bend of a series of small hills that butt up against the southwestern side of the Foramere Basin, there is a small cluster of trees, one of which is the largest of the group, that may function as a function of this that is only about a 30-minute walk from these.
Marisha: That's doable. There we go.
Laura: Fly back down and I tell them. I look along the path, though, and make sure it's safe, the walking back. Is it okay?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Hopefully nobody saw the comely half-elf flying through the bright blue sky.
Laura: I wear turquoise to blend in with the blue surroundings.
Matt: You didn't blend in too well, as when you crested over, a number of the families and kids that were prepared were pointing up. "Mom, she's flying!" People were excited to see you take off into the distance. It was quite a display. Well done.
Laura: I do some circles around and wave.
Liam: Maybe you can join Dr. Dranzel in the circus.
Laura: I hang off of it as I come down, like woo! And then come back up.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a dexterity check.
Laura: Dexterity or acrobatics?
Matt: Dexterity.
Laura: Damn it.
Travis: Outstanding.
Laura: I said as I come down. It was low. I was low.
Matt: So as Vex takes a moment to do some unique tricks with her elaborate and long-running experience directing brooms across the sky, she gets a bit cocky and does a "look, ma, no hands" moment. However, in doing so, the broom sputters out from under the grasp of her legs, and suddenly goes limp as it begins to fall almost as fast as you are, as you both begin to plummet.
Laura: I grab for it! And (hacking spit) as I'm grabbing for it.
Liam: You can't fight the power of the one.
Matt: Unfortunately, you don't have any momentum to go forward, and it's already coasted about 15, 20 feet away from you, and there's nowhere to swim. All the kids are like, "Yay!" Cheering, and all of a sudden you start falling, and they go (screaming). And starts yelling.
Taliesin: Which child in the crowd is going to become Robin? I'm so excited.
Matt: I want you to go ahead and roll an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: This is how we make a vigilante.
Laura: Okay, okay. 25.
Matt: 25, okay. So you only suffer nine points of falling damage as you hit the ground and do a tumble, land arms out and catch the broom, smiling amongst the serious pain in your legs and back.
Laura: I'll bet you thought I was really falling!
Matt: All the kids are like, "Yay!" And start cheering, clapping. Even the parents start clapping. The guards start clapping, like, "That was genuinely impressive." Played it off.
Travis: Blood trickles out of the ear from the brain trauma. (laughter)
Sam: Does the broom just fall, or does it shoot off like a missile?
Matt: It shoots off for a second, carrying the momentum of the propulsion, and then it falls limp as it no longer has the immediate connection with the person. But she did catch it after she tumbled.
Sam: Oh, okay, that's cool.
Taliesin: Working on it.
Laura: I'm going to work on that trick, you guys, and it's going to be amazing.
Taliesin: I think it's perfect.
Liam: Blood for the blood gods.
Matt: All right. Finding the tree, you guys walk, and bringing the families and the children and the people that were chosen to go to Whitestone, Keyleth, you create your Transport via Plants spell. (whoosh) The doorway opens, and it barely fits onto this one half-dead willow that's cresting the side there. Everyone (gasps).
Marisha: We form the line, the ranks.
Liam: Climb through, climb through, you have to move quickly.
Marisha: Go, go, go, go!
Matt: At the very end, Elowen's the last one through, and she's holding the letter and she looks back and says, "Promise," and leaps through right as it closes in the tree. You look toward the guards that were with you guys, who are just watching this whole thing with their eyes wide open.
Travis: Glad you let us in, aren't you?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: I turn to him and I go, high five! Okay.
Matt: At this point, you see two figures walking towards you at this southern forest.
Sam: Two figures walking towards us?
Matt: Towards you guys, rather hastily.
Sam: I draw my whip.
Matt: Okay. Whip's out. You glance over and, easy enough to see, it is Drez Vina and this older individual, both rushing up. Drez has his hand up. "Excuse me, I'm sorry, pardon me!"
Taliesin: Yes, hello? Hello?
Matt: "It has been some time, everyone. Pleasure to see you again."
Laura: We remember, dear.
Matt: "Wondrous, wondrous. I'm here with--" And as he gestures, the old man puts his hand in front and goes, "Would you please just let me talk for once? Hello. I am--" And he looks over. "Has he been giving you my-- I am Master Quall. Pleasure to meet all of you."
Sam: Quall?
Matt: "I was the collector that had hired you in previous times as Drez has recently made me aware, and while our track record has been spotty, you seem to be rather able-bodied, and whispers this morning that have come to my ears mention that you have interest in returning to Westruun. Is that correct?"
Sam: To set it free, yes.
Matt: "Wondrous, wondrous." He looks over to Drez. Drez goes, "Yes, well, you see, the master here lives within Westruun, and-- " "I'm talking, I've got this. My abode, which is a relatively humble structure, two stories, bricks and dark wood, southeast of the town square, right by the fountain crossroads, I'm sure you've seen it before. Since this whole endeavor has happened, it has usurped a bit of progress in my experimentation, and I would be remiss if I didn't request your assistance in perhaps retrieving a very important piece of my collection so I might continue this research in this desolate place."
Liam: What are the subjects of your experimentation?
Matt: "Various things. I enjoy finding out the base elements of existence and life."
Laura: Insight check.
Matt: Insight check.
Laura: He's lying. 18.
Matt: 18.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Travis: Whispers!
Sam: Dagger Dagger Dagger is one of the shirts that's available. There's Strongjaw Ale. Strongjaw Ale available for sale. Check it out. Geek and Sundry.
Taliesin: That's very interesting. Did you know that I'm a collector as well, actually?
Matt: "Really? Oh, quaint."
Taliesin: Of specifics.
Matt: "Of what?"
Taliesin: Specifics. I see that you have not really handed any over.
Matt: "It may be a bit beyond your understanding."
Laura: Very few things are beyond his understanding.
Matt: "Very well. I appreciate the synergies between various elements and the ability to link the essence with that of a living organic entity, or the transition of such living essence into what is normally non-living matter."
Marisha: So you're a necromancer.
Matt: "No! I don't deal with that ridiculous stuff."
Taliesin: He's talking about transmutation of some kind.
Matt: "Yes, yes! Thank you. The transitioning of essences or sparking essence within what was once non-living matter. I'm talking about elements, I'm not talking about flesh."
Marisha: Like natural elements?
Laura: Like golems.
Taliesin: It's the veganism of necromancy. It's just kind of dull.
Matt: "What was that?"
Taliesin: Nothing.
Matt: "Now, I had previously asked you to retrieve an item in the past. That was part of this research and I was nearing a breakthrough, I believe. However, if you could find your way into this abode and retrieve for me-- It's in the basement, amongst my work desk area. It's a simple dark iron and cobalt circlet. A band, if you will. If you could retrieve that for me, I would make it quite worth your while and be ever-grateful and in your service."
Liam: What are we talking about, a pile of coin, or something else?
Matt: "As I said before, I am quite the collector, and while I do hate to relinquish my grasp on various parts of this collection, for someone who does me a grand favor, I am willing to look the other way as one might disappear."
Laura: What does the circlet do?
Matt: "It's more of an experimental piece."
Liam: Come on. Don't treat us like a bunch of fucking assholes. It's in the middle of shit right now. We're not going to go in there for a trinket. It's obviously something very worthwhile. You would have a better chance with us if you're honest.
Matt: Drez at this point steps forward and goes, "I would appreciate if you respected the master for his research. He is going to offer you a great guide."
Marisha: Oh, shut up, Drez.
Liam: Yeah, you're an asshole. You're the biggest asshole. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to you. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to you.
Matt: "Sir, perhaps we need to--" At which point he looks over and the master's like (cackling). "About time someone called you on it."
Sam: Master Quall. We're looking for the Vestiges of Divergence.
Laura: Scanlan, what the fuck?
Sam: Oh, am I not supposed to say that? Do you know where those are? That's what we want. If you can offer us one of those, we'll do business with you. Otherwise, we're going to fuck off.
Marisha: Wait, he might. Look, Master Quall. Finish what you were saying first.
Matt: "Yes. I've heard of this title before. You say you're seeking them, are you?"
Sam: I am. Not them.
Matt: "Where are you seeking these? Whereabouts are you off to?"
Marisha: Well, we were headed towards--
Sam: We don't know where they are.
Laura: They're all sorts of different places. We're trying to figure that out right now. We're not exactly sure. We're not exactly sure, Keyleth.
Sam: We thought you might know.
Marisha: How is what we're seeking less important than where we're seeking it? I'm really confused.
Travis: Oh, you know, just in case we mention where we might be looking for them, in front of these people.
Laura: Because what if he goes to find them?
Matt: "Don't worry."
Marisha: Does he look like the man capable of going and finding things? He's trying to send us back into his own god damn basement to get his own shit.
Matt: "See, there is a woman who speaks both her mind and a mind of quite acute truth."
Sam: She is cute.
Laura: Is it morning yet? Can Pike come join us yet?
Sam: She is being sought.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, there's a little (crackling) flash of divine energy before you, and a slight popping sound as out of the middle of the air next to you, there comes, jogging in, a freshly winded, fully armored Pike.
Sam: What an entrance!
Taliesin: See, you start arguing and you just make a gnome. This is what happens.
Travis: I run over and I pick up Pike and I spin her around in a big bear hug.
Ashley: Hey, Grog!
Travis: Oh, my little buddy Pike. We missed you.
Ashley: Oh, I missed you guys.
Marisha: Hi, Pike!
Ashley: Hey guys! Oh, who are these two?
Matt: At this point, Master Quall is going through a series of notes. He goes, "I'm very certain this gnome was not created."
Marisha: And you remember Drez.
Ashley: Oh, yes. Mr. Vina. Drez Vina.
Matt: "Yes. It is a delight to see you as well, small one."
Ashley: Hi!
Matt: "Well, this grew very complicated."
Taliesin: Master Quall.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Let's lay the cards on the table. If we find this thing of yours in your basement, and if we go to your home, we are certainly going to go into the basement and find it now regardless, we're going to figure out what it is before we give it to you anyway. The world is dangerous right now, and it is not appropriate to just be handing mystical artifacts of great strength willy-nilly to anybody who asks. The world is dangerous and we need to make sure that power is flowing in the correct direction. Now, you can either be forthright with that and get your property, or we can find it in your basement and experiment on it until we know what it is.
Matt: "Good luck even attempting such an endeavor."
Taliesin: I have very good luck attempting these endeavors.
Matt: "Well. Let's just say that it's a device that, when completed, to the specialty of my own training and studies, would enable me the means of personal defense to get me through these rather difficult and dangerous times. As I am not getting any younger and it seems that we're having entities of great power and mischief intent on destruction continuously tearing down my very doorways--" He looks off in the direction of Westruun. "I would feel more comfortable if I could keep myself well guarded. And that is what this circlet is intended to provide."
Laura: Tell you what, Master Quall.
Matt: "Yes?"
Laura: We're not heading there now, but we'll be going back, and when we do, we will find your home, and we will search out this circlet.
Sam: Well, hold on, before we just say no, what's the reward? Do we know what you're paying for this?
Taliesin: Well, he's got a collection.
Matt: "A simple trade of my collection. You bring me one of my items, and I gift you one of mine as well."
Taliesin: I personally feel this is reasonable.
Marisha: I'm curious if you could be more beneficial in paying us with information. With knowledge.
Laura: As well as something from your collection.
Matt: "I am more than willing to offer information for trade. It is quite a grand trade indeed. If that is acceptable."
Laura: No, we would want something as well, physically.
Taliesin: This is a deposit of information.
Matt: "All right. Then, as part of the deposit, what do you require of me?"
Marisha: Are you familiar with a sphinx named Osysa?
Matt: "Can't say that I am."
Marisha: Resides up-- No?
Taliesin: What does he know, perhaps, of the-- no?
Marisha: Are you familiar with any other sphinxes that reside in this area? Do you know the address?
Matt: "I'm sorry, but they don't really wander in open daylight."
Laura: Do you know where they wander?
Taliesin: In darkness, if they don't wander in open daylight.
Matt: He gives a curious look at both of you. "I am not a master of mythology. I do not know of such entities and where they might reside or exist. I apologize."
Marisha: Well, you do seem to be a master of items. We are looking for certain special Vestiges.
Matt: "So you say. And you're saying this sphinx may want to help you in this endeavor?"
Marisha: We're not sure yet.
Taliesin: It's a long walk.
Marisha: We thought maybe he could help us find them, but maybe you could be of a similar service.
Matt: "Well. What I do have--" And he turns around. "Come with me to my tent, please. I may have something that can be of service to you."
Marisha: Sure.
Laura: I give Pike a hug as we walk to his tent.
Sam: Actually, I pull Pike aside and say-- Well, not aside. I just ask her, how's Whitestone? What's going on there?
Ashley: Well, it's okay. I think I got to the point where I couldn't build anymore, heal any more people. I needed a little adventure. But everything is as you would think it would be.
Sam: No dragon attacks?
Ashley: None at the moment. We've been trying to hold down the place as much as we can, and getting there seems to be okay.
Liam: I did not go up to Pike. I hung way the fuck back.
Matt: All right. You guys eventually make your way back to the small outpost, at this point, to the tent of Drez Vina and Master Quall. Master Quall steps inside. You hear him rummaging through some things. Something rolls and breaks, and you hear, "Oh, damn it!" from the inside. He comes back out and goes, "All right, so, this." And he holds up this small glass bauble. The inside has a spinning, looks like a brass gyroscope-type interior. He goes, "This item, when clasped and concentrated on, should light up any sort of nearby magical incantations or enchantments. This, if you are in the presence of such objects as you are seeking, should be quite helpful in locating their presence. It does not have an incredibly long range, but it should, at the very least, be somewhat helpful."
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Sam: You're giving this to us?
Matt: "I'm lending it to you. Should you wish this to be part of the trade instead of something from my collection..."
Laura: No no no. Lending is--
Taliesin: Lending is perfectly agreeable.
Matt: "Now I have lent you something in the past, and not only did it not return to me, but I had to extract the funds by forcing another contract on you. Can I trust you to complete this endeavor?"
Sam: You can trust us, as far as Grog can throw me.
Travis: Pretty fucking far.
Taliesin: You can trust her.
Matt: "Deal." And he hands it out.
Travis: We will make our way into the city, and when we do, we will look for your items.
Matt: "Thank you. I appreciate that."
Sam: Or we could just send Vex on a broom right now to get it solo--
Marisha: Wait, what? What?
Taliesin: We are not flying a half-elf into the city on a broom that she has already fallen off of in the last 24 hours.
Liam: Archers!
Laura: I am recovering a bit right now, but thank you for the wonderful, wonderful idea, Scanlan!
Sam: I think you can do it. I think you can do it.
Laura: Thank you! I appreciate the vote of confidence.
Liam: He is a tactician.
Marisha: Hey, what might this item be called, Sir Quall?
Matt: "I haven't named it, actually. I made it for myself. Call it what you like."
Sam: How about "The Hunk of Quall"?
Marisha: The Hunk of Quall.
Matt: "Should you wish, certainly."
Taliesin: Didn't we had a conversation about letting him name things? I feel like we had this conversation.
Travis: Always do it, right?
Matt: "Enjoy carrying among yourselves The Hunk of Quall."
Travis: Thank you. Drez Vina, it hasn't been a pleasure, nice to see you.
Matt: Drez crosses his arms, "Indeed. All right, good luck."
Travis: And can I take Pike around the shoulder and lead her out of the tent?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Hey, hey... hey, Pike?
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: So I'm glad things have been good at Whitestone. They've been good, yeah?
Ashley: Yeah, they've been all right, I mean, it's okay, I've been missing you guys, though.
Travis: Yeah, we miss you a whole lot. Listen, I've got some rough news, actually. We made it back to Westruun, and the city has kind of been ransacked and overtaken. It was attacked by a bunch of dragons, and what's worse is that after it was attacked-- you know that herd of wandering goliaths that left me for dead in the woods?
Ashley: Of course.
Travis: Yeah, they've kind of taken control of the city, and I think that's my family that's in there.
Ashley: Oh no.
Travis: Yeah. Look, we wanted to go in, I wanted to look for Wilhand, but we haven't done it yet, and--
Ashley: Have you heard anything else? Do you think they are okay?
Travis: I don't know. Some of us went in via mist and they haven't seen him, but they don't really know what he looks like. The place looks pretty rough, he's not here in this little encampment. I'm not really sure where he is.
Ashley: Okay. Well, I wonder if we should go look for him
Travis: Yeah, I want to, but like, listen. I'm afraid to put everybody in the group in jeopardy. They're going to be there, in the city, and I was wondering what you might think about going to look for a few other more Vestiges, trying to find Osysa's mate and seeing if we can find anything that can help us, because it's going to be a fight, right? And you know me: I fucking love a fight, but--
Ashley: That's a lot of them.
Travis: Yeah, it's a lot.
Ashley: I think we should wait until we're fully prepared.
Travis: Yeah, you think so?
Ashley: I think so. I don't think it's safe any other way.
Travis: I missed you so much!
Ashley: Oh Grog, I missed you too!
Travis: And I cry a little bit into my beard, and I wipe it away I'm like: Oh! The pollen out in these fields is awful! (laughter)
Ashley: It's okay, Grog! I give him a hug, and I take my blue scarf and I pat his eyes.
All: Oh!
Travis: (crying) It's raining! (laughter)
Travis: As soon as we find this out, if we find nothing-- I promise, I pledge to you that we will find Wilhand.
Ashley: Okay.
Travis: All right.
Matt: All right.
Sam: So, is the task then to go find the orcs that are keeping their people hostage up in the Frostweald?
Laura: We head into the Frostweald, we find the orcs and send them back and keep going and find this Sphinx-y mate.
Marisha: Did we have any other information of where he is in the Frostweald or do we just know Frostweald?
Laura: We just know Frostweald. Pike?
Matt: The information that you received was, somewhere in the base of the Stormcrest Mountains, past the Frostweald.
Marisha: Past the Frostweald?
Liam: Through it to the base of the mountain.
Laura: Of the what mountain?
Matt: Stormcrest Mountains.
Liam: That's a real place.
Travis: Actually, Pike.
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: I've been holding on to something, and I think you might like it. I have these Gauntlets of Ogre Power, and I can't wear them anymore, because I got some new stuff, and if you wear it, your strength score goes up to 19.
Ashley: What!
Travis: Do you want them? You have to attune to them.
Ashley: Do you think they'll fit?
Travis: I think they might shrink. I don't know, though.
Taliesin: Do you know what 19 means?
Travis: Isn't it like a French dish?
Laura: Yes.
Ashley: I would love to wear those.
Travis: All right, and I give Pike the Gauntlets of Ogre Power.
Matt: As you guys take a short rest to prepare for this, Ashley, you take some time with the gauntlets, and while you're looking them over and taking your own armored gauntlets off and replacing them with these, your hand goes-- It's like placing a baseball into a bucket. It's so big around your arm. But then as you take a moment to see the metal and reflect upon it, you can feel the hum of magical energy that begins to invisibly intertwine with your forearm as the metal begins to creak almost, and it shrinks down, encases itself to your forearm. While it doesn't match the metal of your armor, the silver-gold theme that goes on along it with this weird ogreish face that's built into the plate there, you feel suddenly this surge of strength begin to spill through your body, and you're pretty confident that this may be useful in the near future.
Laura: You're stronger than Grog now!
Matt: You are technically now stronger than Grog.
Ashley: I let out a little battle cry. (battle cry)
Travis: Yeah, and I go to give her a fist bump.
Ashley: I fist bump him!
Matt: And it hurts you a little bit.
Laura: Oh, shit! Pike is so strong!
Travis: Holy shit. Nice, Pike!
Matt: Pike, what was your strength before?
Ashley: 13.
Matt: Okay. At a 19, you're now at a plus four as opposed to a plus one to all your hit and damage with your physical weapons.
Liam: You just Tyler Durden-ed out, son!
Matt: So on your sheet, where it has your attack bonus with your mace, or with your morningstar, and the damage, add a plus three to both the attack bonus and damage.
Ashley: All right, because right now my attack bonus is plus seven, so I add three to that.
Matt: It's now plus ten.
Laura: Holy moley!
Marisha: That's so cool! You're a beast!
Liam: Little golden bullet.
Ashley: I can't find a pencil! That's okay, I'll make a note. I can do it later. I am unprepared. Yes, I am unprepared for all this strength!
Travis: Right, so now we have all our stuff. Should we make our way towards that area they said that the orc raiders were coming from?
Sam: Yeah, it's a couple days from here?
Matt: On foot travel, it's about a day and a half.
Sam: For mist form?
Matt: Mist form, you'll get there by nightfall.
Laura: But we can't use it, because she already used the travel through the trees.
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: But we saved all those people, Scanlan.
Sam: Pike, can you make us mist?
Ashley: No, I can't do anything like that.
Sam: All right.
Laura: Let's walk.
Ashley: I feel like I haven't spent any time with Vax.
Sam: With Vax? Oh, he's around. You know, he's probably just sulking.
Liam: I walk away.
Matt: You glance back and see Vax towards the back of the group. Noticing this conversation, Vax immediately turns around and walks away and dodges around one of the nearby tents.
Liam: Big nope to that one.
Travis: What is the weather like outside?
Matt: Actually, today it's spotty clouds, but blue sky. It's actually pretty good weather, versus a lot of the rain that you had over in Vasselheim.
Travis: Cold, snowy on the ground?
Matt: No. Because you're getting a little further south than the northern area of it, the temperature is probably around high 70s, low 80s.
Laura: It is going to get cold, though, once we head into the Frostweald. We had all those fancy cloaks. I had winter's cloaks for all of us before.
Travis: I still have mine.
Laura: Does everyone still have their winter's cloaks from a long time ago?
Marisha: I do.
Taliesin: Oh, wow, yes, look at that.
Sam: I didn't burn it.
Travis: Let's go.
Sam: We're just going to walk? Do these refugees have any horses or anything?
Laura: They're refugees.
Matt: The few horses they do have are currently quartered to wagons and look to be more beasts of burden for, if they have to move, to carry most of their goods with them, as opposed to riding horses.
Travis: Come on, man, let's just hoof it.
Sam: All right, we'll walk.
Marisha: Oh my gosh, are we walking? We haven't walked anywhere in so long.
Liam: It's like we're back in New York again.
Marisha: It's like we're level three again.
Matt: And those horses will survive, because you didn't take them.
Travis: Oh, that's fucked up.
Laura: That's really sad.
Travis: Take a walk. Save a horse.
Matt: That's a good Vox Machina bumper sticker.
Taliesin: My other horse is walking.
Travis: Coming to the Geek and Sundry store.
Matt: All right. You guys make your Fellowship trek southward with the sweeping camera drone shot.
Laura: I constantly keep an eye out for anything in the front of us and behind us.
Matt: Thankfully, most of these fields, of varying degrees of grass height, but for the most part it's pretty wide vision of where you're heading.
Marisha: I paint pictures in the clouds as we go.
Laura: Oh, that's good. That'll definitely not let anyone know magical people are on their way.
Taliesin: Just point arrows in the opposite direction.
Travis: Graffiti as we go.
Ashley: Can I insight-check Vax?
Matt: Sure. Roll an insight check.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: I believe you.
Marisha: This never happens.
Sam: You just saw all of his dirty dreams.
Matt: What does she see and read on your face and body language, Vax?
Liam: I got to say this?
Matt: I can say it, if you want to.
Liam: I don't want these assholes to know what I'm thinking. I don't know. Can't whisper it to her.
Matt: You can text it to her real fast, if you want.
Liam: Yeah, I'll text it to you.
Laura: But put it on Twitter so that everybody else knows what it is.
Liam: No.
Ashley: I'll post it.
Matt: Okay, so you'll have an incoming text of information. As you guys continue walking, these are the observations you make of Vax as you travel southward. You travel for the better part of a day. You get quite a bit south. You do see in the distance a few times what appear to be some pack animals, some larger beasts that roam the land, none that are necessarily aggressive unless you encroach upon their territory, and Keyleth, you have experience with some of these beasts, so you manage to keep people at bay and traverse around what they claim as their own landscape. No terrible detriment to your traveling speed. You make your way to the point where the sun goes down. You can stop and camp for the night or you can push through the evening. What do you wish to do?
Marisha: Are there any trees nearby?
Matt: Little periods here, little tiny groves that might be spotty along your journey, but for the most part it's open fields.
Marisha: How much further do we have, do you think?
Matt: One more day. One more eight-hour period of travel.
Laura: We should probably rest, then, right? We'll be hitting the Frostweald at night tomorrow.
Taliesin: We're not in a rush.
Laura: Not anymore. The dragons are bunkered down, I believe.
Taliesin: Everything we do now is measured in weeks and months and not days.
Laura: And I still have a little dried blood on the outside of my ear. I could use a bit of rest.
Taliesin: Actually, yeah, do you have a concussion? Is that something that we can-- how many fingers am I holding up?
Laura: You're really blurry, Percy, I have no idea.
Travis: Nine!
Matt: Save versus brain swelling. Are you guys setting up camp?
Laura: I want to pull my brother aside when we set up camp.
Sam: Do we want camp, or do you want to sleep in a mansion?
Laura: Pike hasn't seen your beautiful mansion!
Marisha: Oh, you have to show her the marble floors.
Taliesin: Do we want to do it now, or do we want to do it tomorrow night, is the question?
Sam: We can do it both.
Laura: Oh, that's right-- We can do it both nights?
Sam: I can do it every day, right?
Ashley: Where do you have a mansion?
Laura: Scanlan has a mansion, Pike!
Sam: I inherited some money. It's a long story. There was a great-uncle Vesuvius.
Taliesin: Also known as Uncle Touchy. Uncle No-No.
Liam: Canon, that's canon.
Sam: The court said that he had to give me-- No. We'll sleep in the mansion tonight, and they all know where they're sleeping, but I'll personally show Pike to her chambers, which are right next door to mine at the end of the long hallway. My room, obviously, the biggest, tallest. Pike's a close second. Beautiful, covered in yellow rose petals as far as you can see.
Matt: So, Pike, as Scanlan creates this somewhat shimmering door of mystical energy in the middle of the air off of the path you guys have been walking, in the middle of this field. It's just the open grass that's blowing with this gentle night breeze, a little bit of the moonlight is coming through the clouds, giving enough of a visual of this change in the air space. He pushes open the shimmering door, and on the inside is this beautiful mansion. Tall foyer with marble floors, pillars that raise to the ceiling with gold trim. There's a giant portrait in the center of the main stairway now that has both Scanlan and you on horseback over a beautiful landscape. There are a number of mystical servants that are somewhat transparent and spiritual, arcane energy in form, that take your coats and offer food. A delicious meal is presented for all of you.
Sam: Mostly chicken.
Matt: It's mostly chicken. It's a lot of chicken.
Laura: I'm having a lot of talk with the servants about different ways to prepare food.
Sam: Please do.
Taliesin: They keep clucking it up.
Matt: Protein, bro! Scanlan does lead you to your room, which is right next to his, and covered in yellow rose petals, a beautiful interior. The color scheme is marked tailored specifically to your tastes that he's been able to glean from conversations with you over the past couple years.
Sam: Blues, silvers. There's a little mini prayer area for her to pray to Sarenrae, and there's a little statue of Sarenrae, and if you pull it, a little secret door opens to my room. But it's a small door that only a gnome could fit through.
Ashley: Oh, great! Is there a lock on that, maybe? (laughter)
Sam: Only on my side.
Ashley: Okay. Oh, this is beautiful, Scanlan!
Sam: I did it for you. And, hey, while we have a moment alone, can I just mention something to you? Listen, I'm not really concerned with other people's vices or bad behaviors, but Grog has this sword, and it's sort of not good. It could be used for good, possibly, but I'm just worried about it. Just keep an eye on it. I don't know what it is, and maybe you could just check it out next time you're friending it up with him.
Ashley: Okay. When they had that fight with Percy, up in the house, I felt like there was something weird with that sword. I'll check it out.
Sam: I don't want to judge him or what he does, but just make sure that it won't kill any of us. That's all I care about.
Ashley: Yeah, that's a good plan. Okay, I will. Thanks, Scanlan.
Sam: Sleep tight. And if you hear any footsteps in your room, it's not me. It's the servants, I assure you.
Laura: Can I find-- Is there a library in the mansion, Scanlan?
Sam: Of course.
Laura: Can I pull my brother into a library or something? I just want to talk to you.
Liam: What? What?
Laura: Okay, weirdo. I couldn't help but notice, anywhere Pike was, you were not, all day today, and I have a feeling it's because--
Liam: You want to talk?
Laura: Yes. I do. Don't walk away from me, please. I have a feeling it's because of this Raven Queen situation. I don't know. I know that you offered yourself to her to save me, and I can't put into words how much that means to me. I'm worried that she took you up on the offer, and I know you're worried about it, too. And I'm afraid that's why you're avoiding Pike. You're afraid she's going to see something in you. But I wanted to tell you, I've been looking through this book. It's the best 35 gold I've ever spent. Maybe it was 30 gold, I don't even remember anymore.
Liam: It was 30.
Laura: It was 30! It would have been worth 35 for all the things that I found in it! Look, it's got all this information about the Raven Queen, and I've been looking at it all the time. I don't think she's as horrible as you're afraid she is. Can I tell you what I found?
Liam: Yes, please.
Laura: It says that those that follow her must hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life. That's not bad. Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it. Bring down those who try to cast off the chains of fate. The Raven Queen represents death, right? Therefore she hates those that live an immortal life. She hates vampires! We hate vampires! They're terrible people, right? That's not bad! Watch for the cult of Orcus, and stamp them out whenever they arise. Orcus is bad. If she hates him, then she must not be that terrible.
Liam: She's already speaking to me.
Laura: Oh. And?
Liam: I don't know, Vex'ahlia. I don't know what this means. I know that she's not a force for evil. Neither are funeral homes. I don't want to bed down in one.
Laura: Well, that's understandable.
Liam: But it doesn't matter. And I'd do it again, because I did it for you, and I am trying to come to terms with it, not knowing the terms.
Laura: Well. We've lived half our life in the shadows. You've made them your home. Am I right?
Liam: Maybe so.
Laura: This is a time you can either let those shadows swallow you down and keep falling into a hole, or you can use them to your advantage. You can become a champion. It's pretty fucking badass, if you ask me.
Liam: Do you know how bad this armor smells?
Laura: I can smell it, actually. Pretty terrible.
Liam: It's several centuries old. It's not pleasant.
Laura: Maybe we can get you some oils or something to put on it.
Liam: Maybe.
Laura: What I'm saying is, brother, I'm proud of you, and I'm happy for you, and I'm so, so thankful for you. And you don't need to be frightened! This is a wonderful thing. Not many fucking people can say they're a champion of a fucking god.
Liam: Listen. I'll take what you say under consideration. Again, none of us, you and I don't know what this means. I'm waiting to see.
Laura: All right. But as someone who's seen the other side and has come back thanks to you, there's no use living your life in fear. I love my reckless brother, as much as he hurts my heart. I love you for that, and don't be afraid to be that.
Liam: I have no clever answer to give you.
Laura: That's wonderful. I love you. And I walk away! (laughter)
Liam: I go to bed.
Taliesin: Before Scanlan disappears, I grab him as he's leaving.
Sam: I'm just making the rounds, make sure everyone's tucked in for the night.
Liam: Scanlan's like, wasn't looking in on Pike. Wasn't looking in on Pike.
Taliesin: Have you, perhaps, installed some sort of workspace in this wonderful home of yours for me? I've got a few little projects I want to poke at.
Sam: You mean the all-purpose room?
Laura: The Room of Requirement?
Taliesin: I'm a little worried by what all-purpose necessarily means.
Sam: Don't look in there with a black light.
Taliesin: It's not really a work table, is it?
Liam: It is the danger room.
Sam: It's all purposes, Percy. All purposes. But yes, it is a private room. No one can hear you scream in there. It's the farthest wing we have. I can give you some servants to help you set something up, bring in some tables, whatever. We don't have much in here, we're not prepared for chemical reactions.
Taliesin: Nothing complicated, just some very basic blacksmithing and a little bit of leatherwork.
Sam: Do I have that stuff? Anything to help him?
Matt: Yeah. If it was prepared within the house.
Sam: I tried to make enough stuff for all of us to have our basic needs met.
Taliesin: I can think of some very sexy things that can be done with an anvil. Think about it.
Sam: All my anvils are gnome-sized.
Taliesin: That's comical.
Marisha: Keyleth pops her head out into the hallway. Did I hear something about working? Are you working?
Taliesin: Yes. Scanlan's helping me find a room that apparently is so sound-proof we don't actually have to hear anyone else's drama.
Marisha: Oh, that's fantastic.
Taliesin: I know. Grab a book. It'll be fun.
Marisha: I might join you.
Sam: Are you going to have a working dinner? I'll send some chickens down.
Marisha: I can't sleep, so, yes.
Travis: What about cows?
Taliesin: No cows in my room either, please.
Marisha: I join Percy and help him.
Matt: Okay. You guys find the all-purpose room, which does have the basics required for smithing. The smithing gear that is brought to you by the servants in itself is very, very finely crafted and nearly weightless. It's really impressive, and you look at the label, and it has a small timer on it before it becomes immaterial.
Taliesin: I can work with materials that are in the Bag of Holding, that are real materials, as long as I put them back in the Bag of Holding and take them with me? I can't leave anything, obviously.
Matt: Yeah. Anything you leave in here will just be spat out.
Taliesin: Oh, it'll just be spat out. That's lovely.
Matt: Yeah, onto the ground where it was.
Taliesin: For the moment, because I don't have everything I need for the broom yet, I want to work on a piece of jewelry, if that's okay. I want to work on the thing.
Matt: Work on jewelry?
Taliesin: I want to construct a little piece of jewelry if that's okay. Not magical.
Matt: Do you have a jeweler's kit?
Taliesin: Do I have a jeweler's kit?
Matt: It's a whole different skill set, man.
Taliesin: I can't tinker something?
Matt: You can tinker something, but jewelry is different from tinkering.
Taliesin: No, well, this is a piece that has purpose. It actually is going to be a functional object.
Matt: What is the function of this object? You need to tell me these things.
Taliesin: I know. This is something that I-- I'm so sorry.
Matt: I'm going to make something! Make me roll for it! I got to know what you're doing.
Taliesin: I want to make a-- I'm so sorry, I'm losing the word.
Marisha: Hey, Percy, what are you trying to make?
Taliesin: Something that's too complicated to explain to you. I'm blanking on it. I may have to just give you the name at the break. A little herb pouch, like one of those cages that close up to put herbs in them?
Sam: Oh, like you make tea with?
Matt: Okay. It won't be pretty, but you can make it functional. Yeah, go ahead and make a tinkering check.
Taliesin: All right, I'll make it pretty later.
Liam: Like a Shoprite bag with a bunch of shit in it?
Matt: This will be a dexterity mod, because it's not a very complicated piece based on what you've constructed in the past. It's more about your ability to make it work.
Taliesin: Dexterity? Thank god, because that's a terrible roll. 14.
Matt: 14. Okay, it takes you the better part of the night.
Marisha: Do I assist him at all?
Matt: With a job this small, there's not a whole lot you can assist with except handing him tools.
Taliesin: I'm not going to run the whole night. At some point I'm going to be like, I don't have the design yet. This is something I want to get right, so this is going to be working towards it.
Matt: Okay, so you get the first stage of that set and ready to go.
Taliesin: I can't think of the name of what it is. I'm so embarrassed.
Matt: You all eventually find yourselves to rest, tasks completed to the extent of which you wanted to, conversations finished. You find yourselves at breakfast, a delightful spread of breakfast chickens prepared for you.
Marisha: I pick one up off the table and I say, hey Vex! (whoosh)
Laura: Shit! I'm not even on my-- (grunt)
Matt: All of you duck instinctively as the chicken has enough time to arc and begin to plummet down before she gets her arrow out, and you see her aiming downward as it falls. As she releases the arrow, it manages to catch it. Go ahead and roll for an attack, see how well it hits.
Laura: Oh, that's good. 30?
Matt: (arrow impact)
Laura: Oh, wait, 28, 28.
Matt: (slightly quieter arrow impact) It pins the chicken to the wall, and then it just sags. The wooden shaft slowly snaps under the weight of the chicken before it hits the ground. One of the servants scoops it up and sets it back on the table in front of Keyleth with the broken arrow shaft sticking out.
Marisha: I like that game. It's my new favorite game.
Liam: Do you want some more broom target practice?
Laura: I need to practice with this broom.
Liam: You do need to practice, seriously.
Marisha: We have more chickens.
Travis: We've got stuff to do.
Laura: Yeah, we have stuff to do.
Liam: I'm still eating. I would love to see you, for five minutes, get up on that broom and fly around and fucking put some arrows in some chickens.
Laura: All right, fine, I'll fucking practice. Does it help me at all to practice on this broom?
Liam: It helps me.
Sam: I will command seven servants to each have a loaded chicken at the ready.
Liam: Pull!
Laura: I start flying.
Sam: Vax, you can do the honors and say the pulls.
Laura: I clench really hard with my thighs to try to hold on to this broom.
Matt: As the rest of you enjoy what is the strangest of Medieval Times experiences you've had, glancing upward to the raised ceiling of this dining room area, you watch Vex spiral around on her broom before, Scanlan?
Sam: Vax is saying pull.
Liam: Pull!
Taliesin: (chicken clucking)
Matt: Roll, with disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, Jesus. Okay.
Travis: Say it. Say it!
Laura: One!
Taliesin: Easiest number to count to.
Matt: So as the first chicken goes in the air, she reaches and goes to aim. However, she catches herself. The broom throws her off, and she stops just in time and haphazardly focuses on just the chicken, not realizing where the chicken had now fallen past. Releases it. Scanlan, I want you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Nine.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Okay, that's not that bad. Damage? Oh, it's automatic hit?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Okay. Oh, no.
Liam: Full damage.
Laura: That's 17.
Matt: So, Scanlan, as you're watching this, chewing, suddenly, (impact).
Sam: (screaming)
Laura: Shit! Scanlan, Scanlan, I'm so sorry! I land, I land. I land and I instantly cast Cure Wounds on him. Fuck, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Matt: A big old chicken dangling at the end of the arrow.
Laura: Pike! Pike, help, help, help, help!
Travis: I'm just applauding. Again! Again! I pick up my chicken and I throw it at Scanlan.
Taliesin: Does this mean when the night's over there's going to be a little pool of blood where the door was?
Matt: You'll find out. Go ahead and roll for healing.
Laura: Oh, God, okay.
Matt: As Vex reaches out and grasps you and manages to heal some of your wounds.
Laura: Oh, good, that's good. It's just 1d8, do I add anything?
Matt: 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier.
Laura: 11.
Matt: So you heal 11 hit points.
Sam: Can I pull out the arrow?
Matt: Sure. A gout of blood sprays out.
Laura: I hold my hand there. Pike, can you help?
Ashley: I'll help, I'll help. That broom is amazing!
Marisha: Isn't it, Pike?
Ashley: Yes! And there are too many chickens in here, anyway. Healing Scanlan.
Matt: Pike, you're just casting a Cure Wounds?
Ashley: Yes, I'll cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: The wound closes as Pike reaches out and, with a small chuckle, heals how many hit points?
Liam: The chicken comes back to life!
Ashley: What did you say, Matt?
Matt: How much do you heal? Roll 1d8 plus five, I'm pretty sure. That was amazing.
Laura: Sorry, Scanlan. You can blame my brother.
Ashley: Nine.
Sam: I'm back.
Matt: You're back to full. The wounds close. Pike's there holding her hands on your shoulders, closing the wound.
Sam: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: You're welcome.
Sam: All right. Well, let's say breakfast is over.
Laura: I'm going to practice a bit more, you guys.
Matt: The other servants are holding their chickens at the ready.
Sam: Pull.
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Ashley: Can I try punching one in the air with my new gauntlets?
Matt: Okay. As he's about to throw it up, Pike runs over and grabs the chicken and throws it and (boom) punches it in the air. Pike, roll a strength check. Roll a d20 and add plus four to it.
Liam: 20 chicken McNuggets fly through the air.
Ashley: This is so dumb, why am I doing this? What am I doing?
Matt: Roll a d20, add four to it.
Liam: For the greater good.
Ashley: Okay, it's not that high. 11.
Matt: 11, okay. You (boom) bat it up with a Pike punch. We'll say for the sake of brevity on this, go ahead and roll one more attack, and this will count for the rest of the shots. With disadvantage.
Laura: Oh, come on. 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You do manage to recover your sense of self-esteem as you manage to pin a couple more chickens against the walls and the table in here, but each arrow is just a reminder of the one stray that began this whole breakfast excursion.
Laura: Sorry about that, Scanlan.
Sam: Great job, Vex.
Marisha: Guys, this is the best brunch we've ever done.
Liam: I will never forget it.
Marisha: That was great. Thank you for that, Scanlan.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Laura: We should probably get a start on a walk.
Marisha: Yeah, so, question, before we leave, you guys--
Taliesin: This is going to make the archery booth at Renn Faire hilarious. Sorry, okay. Carry on.
Marisha: Do we want to travel via Wind Walk, or are we okay?
Sam: We're only eight hours away?
Taliesin: It's only eight hours. Save your strength.
Marisha: Because I can save my strength.
Laura: Yeah, yeah, save it.
Marisha: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Laura: We might come across some orcs.
Marisha: That's true.
Travis: Hopefully. Shit.
Laura: I know, right? I could use some.
Sam: All right, let's set out.
Matt: You guys say good-bye to your servants, gather yourselves as you step out and the door closes behind you. Do you choose to leave the spell up, or are you going to fade it as you walk along?
Sam: If I leave it up, can anyone go in there?
Matt: Anyone that you allow into it.
Taliesin: I want to see if the blood comes out.
Sam: No, I'll shut the door and hide the key under a rock.
Matt: Okay. You guys continue walking southward towards the Frostweald. About another seven to eight hours of travel along that way, you begin to see the Stormcrest Mountains in the distance get closer and loom larger and larger, and you get the feel of the Stormcrest Mountains especially because there is a very large storm surge that seems to rise from the ocean to the east of it that has caused a very heavy thunderstorm that's blasting through. You can't see the peaks of the mountains from this distance. There are clusters of trees and forest areas along, but ahead of you, you can see, coated in a very, very bright, visibly white forest, this is the Frostweald itself, with snowfall. Once again, you've been here before, and there is an essence, and you don't recall the specific reason for it, but there is a purpose, an ancient purpose, as to why this one area is perpetually sitting in the heart of winter. Amongst what is a relatively temperate, in some places almost tropical temperature layer, it is very strange, and part of the mystical calling to the Frostweald is that it is perpetually locked in a winter state. You-- don't worry, I'm working on it.
Marisha: Keyleth takes a second to meditate on the previous time that we were here in the Frostweald, and I cast Find the Path. 6th-level spell. Which gives me the most direct, shortest route as long as I'm on the same plane existence of where I'm going, if I have a vague idea of where I'm going.
Matt: Where are you going?
Sam: We're going to the Stormcrest Mountains, right?
Marisha: We're trying to get to the Stormcrest Mountains through, but we're also looking for the band of orcs travelling.
Matt: If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves, or a destination that isn't specific, such as a green dragon's lair, the spell fails.
Marisha: But we're in the Frostweald, right?
Matt: Yes. You're approaching it now.
Marisha: Is the Frostweald considered on a different plane?
Matt: No. But do you have a specific location that you're familiar with that you want to go to?
Marisha: Well, I can find us the shortest, most direct route to the Stormcrest Mountains.
Sam: Have we been there?
Matt: Yeah, you can see them. I'm trying to figure out. For the spell to work, you have to choose a specific location that you're already familiar with to lead you to it.
Marisha: Right.
Matt: So what are you saying?
Marisha: Stormcrest Mountains. But just because I can see them doesn't necessarily mean we're going to find the most direct path, shortest direct path towards it.
Matt: That's true.
Marisha: Right? Or is this a waste of a spell and I should just do something else?
Matt: I will give you the benefit to say that you can see the mountain range. This is more useful if it's trying to find a place that you're very familiar with, seen a picture of, or you had a very specific bit of information for it. For a general location or a location that you're unaware of, the spell wouldn't have an effect.
Laura: Maybe you could think of the location of her mate, the sphinx's mate.
Marisha: I don't know it, so it fails. That's why I was trying to do Stormcrest Mountains, but apparently that's not specific enough.
Laura: Well, is it specific? It's just we can see them.
Liam: Yeah, it's right there.
Matt: It's a large range that's very visible.
Liam: Let's move on, let's move on.
Marisha: I'll do something else.
Taliesin: Save it for something special.
Matt: So as you guys press forward to the outside of the Frostweald, the snow- and ice-covered treeline is a very familiar sight from your last time traveling here. There are canopies of pine-like trees that interlock with windless snowfall, that leave a fairly dark interior set from the frozen-over canopy. Slick surfaces and knee-deep snowbanks permeate this entire forest region. Your breath is immediately visible as you step past that threshold, and the temperature drops about 40 degrees from what it was before, getting steadily colder the further in you travel.
Laura: Bet you're glad you have that beard now, huh? Keeps you warm? No?
Travis: It's actually quite nice out here. This is like spring for me.
Liam: Are your people-- Did you grow up in the cold?
Travis: Yeah, we're pretty cool.
Liam: Wow.
Matt: Pressing in, as the temperature drops further and further, you occasionally come across a broken sunbeam that manages to penetrate aspects, different places in the canopy, and even stepping into those, they don't lend any change in temperature or warmth. The enchantment that surrounds this entire forest doesn't seem to be moved by such natural incursions. Everyone go ahead and roll a perception check.
Laura: 25. Are we in the woods? 29.
Travis: Two.
Marisha: 18.
Taliesin: 15.
Sam: 20.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: As you guys are walking through, keeping your eyes peeled, Vax, you're so lost in thought that your eyes glaze over for a second and you forget where you are. Pike and Vex, the two of you get a little bit ahead of the rest of the group, pushing through the snow. You come around from a tree and you can see, this is about an hour or so into your entrance to the Frostweald, you see a small clearing with a few patchy trees outside of the heavy canopy, and what appears to be a couple of small stone ruins and a single obelisk, a monolith-like pillar of stone that juts out of the snow. It's about 200 feet away from you guys, 250 feet.
Laura: Can we see anything around it? Any people, any trace of tracks in the snow?
Matt: From this distance, no. You don't see any, there are no figures, there is no movement. There is just that stone piece that, at a slight angle, stands out amongst the rest of the treeline.
Travis: What do you see?
Laura: There's a, look. There's a fucking obelisk. It's a tall stone thing, Grog.
Travis: Yeah? So?
Sam: Let's go over.
Travis: Yeah.
Taliesin: Vex, you and I should hang back, but we'll let everyone else.
Marisha: It's a big obelisk? Are there any birds or anything like that around?
Matt: Listening, that's what's interesting. Usually forests, because they're teeming with so much life, there's a perpetual sound of things that live amongst the boughs and the treeline. Because it's so cold here, it's eerily silent. Every footfall that hits the snow, you can hear the crunch resounding and echoing through the nearby vicinity. It is just a still, silent atmosphere in this forest.
Laura: (clanging) Pike!
Travis: Let me check if it's safe to move on. And I reach down and scoop up a handful of snow, right? Just snow? How's it taste?
Matt: It's the clearest snow you've tasted in a long time.
Travis: Shit's crazy pure, yo.
Sam: So then we're safe to move ahead?
Travis: Yeah, we're good. Let's go check out the scary obelisk.
Liam: Everybody starts inhaling snow.
Matt: Are you moving ahead, Grog?
Travis: I'm moving ahead. Who wants to come with me to the obelisk?
Laura: I'm going to hide behind a tree and watch.
Liam: To the what? What obelisk?
Travis: For what? Why are you hiding?
Laura: I'm just going to keep guard!
Marisha: I'll come with you, Grog.
Travis: There's nobody out here.
Taliesin: I've had bad luck touching things lately. I'm letting other people touch things.
Matt: Grog, Keyleth.
Sam: Pike's coming.
Matt: So Grog, Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan are all going forward. Looks like Vex, Vax, and Percy are staying.
Taliesin: I'm getting another angle so that we have two different vantage points of what may happen.
Laura: Getting a little closer, but keeping.
Matt: Are you going with Percy?
Liam: I'm brainfarting, so I'm just following Percy.
Matt: Okay. Percy and Vax splinter off to the left, Vex you go ahead and take the right, and you head around this clearing while the rest of you walk into the center of it.
Taliesin: We're keeping an eye on that thing in the--
Liam: Look at that!
Taliesin: I know, it's a thing. We're going to let Grog touch it and see what happens.
Matt: You guys approach, and as you're stepping through the snowfall, which right now is, for you, up to just past your knees, like the grass was. For Keyleth it's just up to your waist. Scanlan, you and Pike are both (grunting) like the dogs jumping through the snow that vanish with each leap as you're having to find your way through this heavy snowfall.
Travis: Do you guys want a ride?
Sam: Yes, please.
Travis: I pick up each gnome on my shoulders.
Ashley: Thanks, Grog!
Travis: No problem!
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check as you guys approach this obelisk.
Sam: 25.
Travis: It's a two, minus three.
Marisha: 11.
Matt: What did you get, Pike?
Ashley: 14.
Matt: 14, okay. So as you guys approach, from this vantage point, it's carved, definitely, and the carving is very old. Weathered somewhat, but not too heavily, so it's either not very old or there's not a whole lot of weather that comes through here, and by the stillness of the wind since you've entered, you get the feeling that's probably more the case. It's hard to gauge how old or how long it's been here. But there are various carvings amongst it. There is a big symbol. I want to have you guys roll a religion check real fast.
Travis: Awesome. What the fuck. Natural one.
Laura: You need to not use that dice right now.
Sam: 12.
Marisha: Religion? Nine.
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: 15.
Matt: 15, okay. It looks familiar, but you're having a hard time really getting the essence. Pike, you recognize this. This is not the largely understood or most commonly utilized symbol of Ioun, but it is a very ancient, the basis of the religion of Ioun, which is the same goddess of knowledge that Osysa was overseeing the temple beneath.
Ashley: Wait, how do you spell it?
Matt: Ioun. I-O-U-N. You actually carry a stone, enchanted with the essence of Ioun's knowledge.
Sam: Oh, that's my Ion Stone! Ioun Stone!
Travis: Is it made of, it's stone?
Matt: It's solid, solid stone, and goes up about 35 feet or so.
Travis: Hey, Scanlan, I heard if you touch your tongue to something like this, it'll stick.
Sam: Wow. Wow, we should probably try that out. Keyleth?
Marisha: What?
Sam: Can you go lick that obelisk?
Marisha: Hell no.
Travis: Why not?
Marisha: I know that one. But you should do it, Grog. I can't do it, just because of my elven abilities. It's our saliva, it doesn't work the same way. But you should try it, it's crazy.
Taliesin: Keyleth, that was very clever.
Sam: How far are we?
Matt: You guys are about ten feet from it.
Sam: I'm going to just look around it for any traps.
Matt: Okay. Make an investigation check.
Sam: 18.
Matt: 18, okay. You have to leap off Grog and start wading through. You're finding pieces of broken stone, smaller chunks about that big and bits of stone dust that are scattered amongst the snow. You push around, because you see the ruined walls around. You do find a larger piece of stone that looks like a broken statue, like there must have been some sort of a statue here that had lost the hand, and it's stumbled there on the ground.
Marisha: Upon him seeing that, I pull out my Hunk of Quall and see if it lights up.
Sam: Oh, you have to concentrate on it.
Taliesin: Are there orcs present?
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: I knew someone would laugh at that.
Matt: You hold it aloft. It has a small vibration of energy, as part of the crystal sliver itself, but it doesn't seem to change in the environment.
Marisha: Can I move a little bit closer to the obelisk?
Matt: As you're stepping closer to the obelisk, you also notice there is some writing or some sort of scripture that is carved towards the base, that is partially buried by the snow that has gathered at its base. You find more pieces of statues. Arms, part of a torso, like somebody had knocked over a series of statues. A lot of them have deep grooves in them, like these statues were either carved to pieces, like they were physically torn down--
Taliesin: Are you describing what you're seeing at all?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: I can't have a reaction to this unless I'm actually hearing anything.
Marisha: I do Control Water. Can I do Control Water and clear away all the snow from around it?
Matt: It takes you a little bit of concentration because it's in a different state than liquid, but you begin to focus, and as you guys are watching, Keyleth focusing, a lot of the ice begins to rapidly melt into a water form and it begins to melt away, leaving the wet, muddy ground around it.
Sam: These statues that have been broken. They have gashes and slashes in them?
Matt: Yes, around the areas where they're broken.
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I see the statues at this point?
Matt: From this distance? You can't, unfortunately.
Taliesin: I want to get a little closer, just so I can make out the statues.
Matt: Okay. As the snowfall begins to melt away, you guys see around the base of this obelisk it is a garden of statue-pieces.
Sam: Hey, hey guys!
Taliesin: Are they classical statues or are they people in weird poses? Are the poses weird?
Matt: Some poses look aggressive, some poses look surprised--
Sam: Okay, everybody hey hey hey.
Taliesin: Back up, everybody. Back up now.
Matt: And we're going to go ahead and take a break on that note.
Laura: We fought basilisks in the Frostweald before.
Liam: Basilisks here, yes.
Matt: So. We're going to go ahead and take a quick break here for the restroom and--
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Ashley: Son of a bitch.
Matt: See you guys here in a few minutes.
Travis: I don't see what the problem is. [break]
Matt: Hello, and welcome back, everyone. So. As the snow is melted away, revealing this garden of statues in various states of-- some of them are still solid, some of them are just missing pieces, some of them are entirely shattered, many of them crushed or torn, thick, heavy grooves visible on the pieces of them that have been torn asunder-- the party begins to gather their thoughts and figure out what this might be. You did notice as well that there was writing or script among the bottom of the obelisk, and as the snow melts away, there is another large shape that is carved into it.
Travis: Can I hold my hand up to the obelisk and just feel if there's any, like, heat radiating off of it?
Matt: Sure. As you walk up to the edge of the obelisk and put your hand to it, no heat being radiated.
Marisha: I pull out the hunk of Quall again. Anything? Hold it closer to the symbol.
Matt: It does not seem to be reacting to anything in the immediate vicinity.
Travis: Man, somebody does not like sculptures.
Sam: That--
Taliesin: Those aren't sculptures.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check?
Travis: No, it's art, I get it.
Matt: What languages do you know?
Travis: It's like, interpretations and it seems whimsical--
Laura: Can I hop on the broom and fly up and see if I could spot some basilisks around?
Matt: Sure.
Ashley: Well, Percy, what do you think they are?
Travis: Where is she going?
Marisha: Sorry. Elven, Sylvan, Druidic, Primordial.
Matt: As you walk up and begin to hold the Hunk of Quall towards it, you see that the language-- the script that is beneath the initial symbol of Ioun that Scanlan had seen is Elvish.
Marisha: Oh, okay.
Matt: The rough translation is of old, old, old text, it reads, "A name is earned."
Marisha: A name is earned?
Matt: A name is earned.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Matt: And beneath it, there is what appears to be-- the other large carving you saw on it-- it looks like a triangle. A dark, recessed triangle that is just built beneath the text that tapers internally into a point. It is almost like a reverse pyramid on the inside. It is just an empty space that comes to a point.
Taliesin: Oh, no. I think that there are basilisks nearby.
Laura: Do I see any?
Taliesin: I think these statues are victims.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check? To see if I can see any signs of basilisks?
Matt: Sure. Make a nature check and you make perception check.
Sam: Are we having a short-- is this a short rest?
Matt: No.
Marisha: 21.
Matt: 21.
Laura: 26.
Matt: 26. You glance up above, and you do not see any basilisks. What you can see, this clearing itself is visible from your height, but once you get above the tree-line, you can see the trees are pretty thick. You don't see any signs of basilisks in the vicinity. You, upon looking around the ground, you can see-- it's very muddy now from all the snow that had melted down, and you see that some of the mud is slicking into holes in the ground. Like four-foot-wide cavernous holes that were dug, like little burrows that now have all this water and mud seeping into them.
Marisha: Oh, it was made by a creature, it looks like?
Matt: It looks like. Which one of them (bubbling), expels a bunch of the mud and water, it just comes bubbling outward. At which point, you see something burst out and emerge onto the ground nearby. More of these holes start bursting forth, all the mud and liquid that has seeped into it is now being forced outward, and these creatures, now covered in mud, you can see long, lizard-like bodies with a toothy snout, multiple legs, rows of them of them down the spine, and its tail flickering about.
Liam: I'm closing my eyes.
Laura: Don't look at them!
Matt: I would like you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: Fuck. Shit. I'm standing right in the middle of them.
Travis: Fuck you.
Marisha: Got the fucking shittiest initiative rolls.
Ashley: Yikes.
Taliesin: I have a terrible initiative roll.
Sam: Okay, this is it.
Travis: Feral Instinct's screwing me up.
Sam: Battle in the snow. But we've got Ashley.
Matt: It's hard to see with the mud across their surface, but you do see hints of blue coming through. You have encountered these previously-- these are referred to as the ice-scaled basilisks, the ones that are more specific to this indigenous region. All righty. So, going by initiative order here, folks, 25 to 20?
Laura: 22.
Matt: 22.
Travis: Percy?
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 18.
Sam: 19.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Travis: 11.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: I rolled really badly.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Pike?
Ashley: I know, I know, my initiative is always shit.
Travis: Welcome back, Pike!
Laura: She likes to get the lay of the land before she attacks.
Ashley: Yeah, yeah, you know, I do the clean-up.
Matt: Is that everybody?
Marisha: Pike.
Ashley: I'm eight.
Matt: Pike? Oh. All right. Due to the series of rolls here, they're going last.
Sam: Oh!
Matt: They rolled a five, minus one penalty to dex. So, as these-- which more of them burst up right next to Scanlan right there.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: As they all burst out of the ground, shaking their heads off of the mud, swinging off, slapping into the stone, splattering across the white snow around them, across some of you, they snarl and hiss. As you see their eyes now (click).
Liam: Merry Christmas.
Matt: So, top of this would be you, Vex. You actually would be on top here, on the broom, looking from above.
Laura: We can't look at them, right? We remember that from before?
Matt: You remember, you'll want to try not to.
Laura: Can we-- we can look at them to shoot at them and look away? Just don't look at them at all?
Matt: You can choose at the start of your turn whether to avert your gaze or not. You'll have disadvantage on pretty much everything as long as you're doing that.
Laura: Ah, that's so annoying! I can't tell how everybody's clumped. They're-- just basically they're all amongst all of our friends.
Matt: There's three right here, and one right there behind. It's one, two, three, four.
Laura: Okay. Can I fly down and land on a tall tree?
Matt: You can try to.
Laura: Try to brace myself?
Matt: If you would like to try to.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Let's say for the purposes of this, that you coast down to the height. Stupid broom. Let's say you land down somewhere over here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: All righty? There you are.
Laura: Okay. I avert my gaze-ish, I look off to the side of one, but I can see it in my peripheral, is that how it goes, or it's like--?
Matt: You kind of guess where it is real fast, in the peripheral and kind of--
Laura: I Hunter's Mark one.
Matt: Which one?
Travis: Laser pointer.
Laura: Is that Scanlan? That it's next to?
Liam: Yeah, it's Scanlan next to one of them.
Laura: I do the one next to Scanlan-- That was my eye. That's just a flashlight. Oh, that's how I do it, okay.
Matt: And what are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to--
Liam: Professional D&D player.
Laura: That's right. And I'm going to shoot it!
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Through the Blazing Bowstring.
Matt: Okay. So go ahead and roll with disadvantage for the first strike.
Laura: Oh, I don't get regular because it's my favored terrain, so I cancel it all out?
Matt: It's disadvantage for averting your gaze, advantage for being your favored terrain-- I don't think you get advantage on attacks for being in favored terrain, do you? I think it's just on ability checks.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Yeah. So you're at disadvantage.
Laura: I'm at disadvantage.
Matt: I'll double-check this so the internet doesn't scream at me.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18 with disadvantage?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: That still hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Plus the Blazing Bowstring, plus an additional d10.
Matt: First attack on the basilisk near Scanlan.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17 damage? All right, go ahead and roll for the second attack, with disadvantage as well.
Laura: 17.
Matt: 17 does hit as well. So roll for that one. You included the Blazing Bowstring for the first one, right?
Laura: Yes. 15 on the second.
Matt: 15 points of damage. Holding on the top of the tree, which is starting to bow a little bit with your weight, and you're clutching the broom under one arm, and you pull back and release two arrows in succession, both finding their mark. You did Hunter's Mark damage on top of those?
Laura: Yes I did.
Matt: All right, good. You see, Scanlan, as you try and avert your gaze momentarily as you see the giant creature there, and you recall, two arrows streak past, which gives you a little PTSD, based on your morning. So that'll complete your turn?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: It's right next to me?
Matt: Yes. Are you averting your gaze or not?
Sam: I'm averting my gaze.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: Well jeez, I mean, do I know where they are?
Matt: You saw them all burst out, once they shook off the mud, you heard her shouting and you were like, oh, hmm.
Sam: So I kind of know where they are. All right. I'm going to hop away five feet from the guy who's-- I'm going to get an attack-- yeah, that's a fine direction, sure.
Matt: It lunges out at you with a strike.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: That is a 22 to hit?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. As you pull away, pain strikes your body as the sharp, stone-crumbling teeth of the basilisk reach out and pierce your body for 12 points of piercing damage. You wrestle your elbow out of the way, you can feel the wound beneath your leather armor.
Taliesin: That's barely an arrow and a chicken in the neck.
Sam: (laughs) Okay. And I'm going to aim to the one in the middle there-- does anyone have a pointer? Yeah, that one. The other two are within 20 feet of him, yes?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: So I will cast a Wand of Fireballs right there on him.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: On him or behind him, or where--?
Sam: Just behind him so it hits all three?
Matt: Right, and not yourself.
Sam: Yes?
Matt: I figured that's probably what you want to do, okay. As you back up, release it in that direction, the beam of light streaks out from the wand, hitting the snowbank right behind it and exploding. Already the slushy atmosphere is-- snow and fire scatter around it as they both screech out in pain. DC of what?
Sam: Oh! DC 15! I wrote it down.
Matt: 15. That's... first one fails. Second one rolled a 15, with its minus one dex, that's a 14, that's a fail. And a natural one. So full damage for all three of them. Go ahead and roll that 8d6. Vax, you're on deck, so be ready.
Liam: All right, okay.
Sam: 25!
Matt: 25 points of damage total. The flames subside after the force of the explosion. The obelisk itself shakes from the impact. The three basilisks look notably charred, whatever mud was on them is immediately dried and is now cracking on the outside of their scales. You hear the hissing at their presence. You want to keep moving or stay where you are?
Sam: I'll tuck around the obelisk a little bit.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And I'll turn to Pike, my love, and inspire her with a song. I will sing, (singing) I used to scry you on the shit phone... (laughter)
Sam: (singing) Late-night when I need your love! I know when that poop phone glows, it can only be one gnome! Ever since you left the party, you, you-- (laughter)
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Take your d10 inspiration die, Pike. All right, so d10 inspiration die for you. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Yes. I'm going to click my heels together, set the boots going. I'm going to go very far away towards you, your end of the map. I want to be about a little away from the tree, though, so I've got a clear sight on that one-- further back, though. I know. I want to be 50 feet away. Yeah.
Matt: Okay. You're far away, you're off-map.
Liam: And I'm going to dagger-dagger-dagger him from very far away.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Dagger-dagger-dagger!
Liam: And I'm going to use that sharpshooter trick where I take a negative five to attack, but add ten to damage?
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Laura: On all of them?
Matt: Are you averting your gaze?
Liam: No.
Sam: Whoa!
Matt: All right, so at the start of your turn, on your first part of the round, I want you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: From this far away?
Matt: When you started your turn, you were in melee.
Liam: Okay. So constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Liam: 16.
Matt: 16 total?
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay. The gaze is upon you as you glance over and see the basilisk turn its head over its shoulder at you and hisses, and the eyes catch you. You can feel the magical effects take hold of your body for a moment. You back away and quickly close your eyes, and you can feel that it begin to reach over but you shake it off.
Liam: Oh yeah! Gamble worked out, man!
Matt: So you do not have disadvantage in these attacks.
Liam: Yeah, I know.
Matt: Minus five for each attack.
Liam: First one, and advantage because I'm going before it, so the first one is 18.
Matt: 18 hits.
Liam: Second is 14. And the third is 27.
Matt: First hits, last hits.
Liam: Last hits?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Okay. First one gets sneak attack damage, and plus ten to both hits because of the sharpshooter.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Right. So, here we go.
Laura: (singing) There can only be one gnome.
Liam: I can't think! 33.... 43 for the first one.
Sam: 43?!
Liam: No-no-no... 43 plus... 49 for the first one.
Matt: 49 points of damage.
Liam: And the last one that hits is 19. Sharpshooter.
Matt: As you run backwards, at the basilisk glaring back at you, its toothy mouth opening and the breath out, you shake it off. Throw the daggers. One (impact) sticks into one eye, and the other just (impact) into the other, and it-- (cheering)
Marisha: Damn!
Laura: That was fast.
Matt: The snow nearby is spattered with this kind of dark-purple basilisk blood.
Sam: Ugh! My eyes...
Laura: (gasp) Basilisk blood! We need to take the basilisk blood! Remember, that's super good...
Marisha: Yes! Yup. Uh-huh.
Matt: You want to stay where you are?
Liam: I will take another ten feet back away from it all. Bye, guys!
Matt: All right. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay!
Matt: Avert your gaze or... ?
Taliesin: No.
Matt: Roll a constitution save.
Marisha: Gamblers!
Liam: (singing) You got to know when to hold 'em!
Taliesin: That's a... (counts) 21 points.
Matt: 21?
Taliesin: Constitution save.
Sam: Oh, it's a save! That's right!
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a 14 plus seven.
Matt: That's great!
Taliesin: I look at it in the eye.
Matt: You stare it down and it kind of (snarls).
Taliesin: (barks) Bark it down.
Matt: Orthax has left his mark on you.
Taliesin: I know. I cast Hex on it. I'm looking at the one she's Hunter's Marked, I cast Hex.
Laura: Ooh, nice!
Liam: Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie?
Matt: Same one that she's Hunter's Marked?
Taliesin: Yeah. And I'm taking... I'm giving it a disadvantage on willpower ability checks.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: And I'm going to take three shots with Sharpshooter.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: 12. Misses.
Matt: Misses, unfortunately.
Taliesin: Oh my god, goodbye! Going to the good die, 12.... Better! 24.
Matt: Yeah, third shot hits. Go ahead and roll damage. With the Hex damage as well.
Taliesin: Oh my god! I'm sucking. 22 points of damage.
Matt: 22 points of damage. So the first shot goes wide. Second shot goes wide again. For some reason, it's moving faster than you expected at this moment, missing your sights. The third shot manages to find the front of its nose and (shattering) the front of its skull shatters and it kind of crumbles to the ground.
Taliesin: So, while shooting, I ran from that one tree all the way to the other one. That was a running shot, so...
Matt: Okay, so you run this way?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Liam: It was a lot harder the last time.
Taliesin: Behind the tree over there.
Matt: Over here? Because you can only get about that far with your running.
Taliesin: About there.
Matt: Right there? Okay. Then you got behind there. That's fine. All right, that ends your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I would like to avert my gaze, and go into an averted-gaze rage! (growls) (laughter)
Travis: And I would like to run at that little bastard right there.
Matt: All right.
Liam: (Grog voice) I can't see you but I'm so angry!
Travis: I'm using my Feral-- no, that's wrong. I'm using my... what the fuck is it called?
Taliesin: Slap Fight. Hair Pull.
Travis: I've totally forgotten what's it called. What the fuck is it? Reckless Attack!
Matt: All right, there you go.
Travis: Yes. So can I cancel out the disadvantage and get just a normal roll?
Matt: Yes, you would have a normal roll on this.
Travis: Yes! And Great Weapon Master on these two strikes.
Matt: All right.
Travis: Shit! Nine.
Matt: (whoosh)
Travis: (yells) (laughs) Shit! Nope.
Laura: It's a bad luck night for Grog rolling!
Matt: You rush forward (sword swinging). You thought it was there, you're sure it was there, you heard it hiss. It's about two inches below where you swung.
Travis: I'm so mad that I come out of my rage because I don't hit anything, right?
Matt: You don't have to hit it. You have to attack. There's a difference.
Travis: Well, I've been swinging.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) Ending Grog's turn, Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: How many are left? Two?
Matt: There are two left.
Marisha: I am remembering what the basilisks did last time, and I've only done this once before, and am going to go...
Matt: Avert your gaze or not?
Marisha: I'm looking down and transforming into a giant scorpion.
Taliesin: Scorpions are fascinating.
Sam: How so? They don't have eyes, or something?
Marisha: Yeah, they have blindsight.
Sam: Wait, what does that mean?
Marisha: It means they don't use their eyes to see things. They have blindsight.
Matt: So Scanlan, as you're averting your gaze, you glance over as Keyleth goes (poof) into this giant scorpion, big tail, big pincers, black and red carapace. It's upsetting.
Sam: I'm scared.
Marisha: (clicking pincers)
Taliesin: That's really upsetting.
Marisha: Where are they? The two are kind of in the middle there?
Sam: One's next to Grog.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to move in between them and I'm going to do a multiattack on both of those. I'll start on the one that Grog's not focusing on.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Marisha: So I have three attacks, two with my claws and one with my stinger.
Matt: Do it. Disadvantage on all attacks.
Marisha: No, why?
Matt: Because you averted your gaze.
Marisha: No, I didn't. I have blindsight as a scorpion.
Matt: Right, but at the start of your turn, before anything happens, is when it happens. Did you avert your gaze or not?
Marisha: No, I turned into a scorpion.
Matt: Before that happened, at the start of your turn, did you avert your gaze or not?
Liam: You said you averted your gaze.
Marisha: I said I looked down, but once I'm a scorpion, I have blindsight.
Matt: Right, but the effect takes place before your transformation happens. So, yes or no, do you want to take the advantage or not?
Marisha: Well, I said I looked down and turned into a scorpion to try and avoid it, so... I mean, I did, yeah.
Matt: All right, so disadvantage on the attacks.
Marisha: That's the whole reason I did the scorpion.
Sam: But it's also looking cool.
Laura: It's okay, from here on out, you're fine.
Marisha: Miss. Six misses, for the first one. That's a three, it misses again. Nope, that's a two. Last one is an eight, plus a four... So that's 12. Probably still nothing.
Matt: Let me think here for a second. The scorpion has blindsight?
Sam: Starring Ashley Johnson! Blindsight!
Taliesin: How did we not walk into that? How have we been sitting here and that didn't happen?
Marisha: That legitimately made me spit my fucking coffee in my face.
Matt: No, you're right. I was thinking more in terms of it averting the magical power of the basilisk, but you could still avert and blindsight would allow you to still know where it is without having the disadvantage, so yes.
Liam: Although with coffee in the eye, disadvantage is back.
Matt: This is true. I'll let you reroll those attacks.
Marisha: All three? Okay, I wish I remembered them. Do you want me to reroll all three?
Matt: Just reroll all three. That's on me. I was thinking in wrong terms.
Sam: Matt, you're the worst.
Matt: I know. I know, I am the worst.
Marisha: Jeez, I'm going to tweet at you later about this.
Taliesin: Actually Matt, how blindsight works...
Matt: They've already been sent, I'm sure.
Taliesin: I'm shutting the fuck up now.
Marisha: These are just straight, they don't have disadvantage? First attack, 14.
Matt: 14 does not hit, unfortunately.
Marisha: Second attack was a natural 18, so 22.
Matt: That does hit. And for the tail?
Marisha: For the tail, 16.
Matt: 16 hits. That was my bad.
Liam: Just a bunch of idiots dorking around, guys.
Taliesin: There is coffee everywhere.
Marisha: That's not very much. Four damage for the claw attack, and then for the sting, oh my god. Three damage, and they have to take a constitution saving throw.
Matt: 15, what's the DC?
Marisha: 12.
Matt: Yeah, so it makes the save.
Marisha: Fuck.
Sam: Yeah, Keyleth, good one!
Marisha: Okay, they take 4d10 poison, and on a failed save, they take half as much.
Matt: Okay, so roll 4d10.
Sam: 4d10 is a lot!
Laura: You should be a scorpion all the time!
Marisha: Thanks guys! Wow, these are fucking horrifying rolls. Six, seven, eight, nine, plus seven is 16 points of poison damage.
Matt: Total, so that would be eight for half of it.
Marisha: No, that is halved.
Matt: Nice, that's not bad at all. All right, so as your first claw streaks off its armor, the second one grabs hold and-- hold on a second.
Liam: I'm listening!
Matt: Thank you.
Marisha: Sorry, it was eight damage.
Taliesin: No, you did, because you did half the dice.
Sam: No, she did 4d10.
Taliesin: She did 4d10?
Marisha: Eight damage.
Matt: Eight damage, all right. All right, so as the first claw streaks across its armor, second one manages to grab and actually pince onto it, dealing some damage. As you're holding it there, the tail strikes inward, manages to pierce the outside of the scaly basilisk hide. Not as effective as it could've been, but still you see its body tense with the sudden pulse of poison in its system. That brings us to Pike! What's up?
Ashley: Okay. Since I can't see it, is there any way that I can Guiding Bolt one of the basilisks without hurting anybody?
Matt: Yeah, but for Guiding Bolt I believe it's a spell attack roll. Am I correct on that? Or does it automatically hit? I'm trying to remember which one it is. You guys have so many spells. Guiding Bolt, yeah. You can totally Guiding Bolt. You'll have disadvantage on the attack roll, but you can do it still.
Laura: Do it, Pike!
Ashley: All right, let's do it!
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll with disadvantage on the attack.
Sam: Which one, the one near Grog or the one near scorpion-face?
Ashley: Which one would I not hurt anybody?
Matt: It's not so much you hurting anybody, you wouldn't hit anybody. It's about if you miss or not.
Marisha: Grog and I can take it anyway.
Ashley: Okay.
Liam: The one by Grog.
Ashley: Yeah, we'll do the one by Grog.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Oh, natural 20!
Matt: But it's with disadvantage, so you have to roll it again.
Liam: Say it again.
Taliesin: One in 20 chance.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: With that, unfortunately, as you're holding your eyes at bay--
Sam: Wait! You're inspired!
Matt: You can add the inspiration dice if you want to.
Ashley: Yeah, I'll add inspiration!
Matt: Okay, so roll a d10 and add that to the attack. 13 plus...
Ashley: Okay, okay, okay. All right, seven. So 20.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on Guiding Bolt. So 4d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: Okay... 17!
Matt: Nice, all right! 17 points of radiant damage, and now there is a glowing hue of radiant light around it, so even though you're not looking at it, it's a pretty decent beacon, so it gives advantage on the next attack roll against it. Keep that in mind. Do you want to move at all or do you want to stay where you are, Pike?
Ashley: I'll stay, yeah, I'll stay.
Matt: All right. Now it is their turn. This one turns around and it's going to go ahead and make a bite attack against you, Keyleth, in scorpion form. That's a 17, plus six?
Marisha: That hits.
Matt: All right. You take 11, plus three. 14 points of piercing damage, plus seven points of poison damage.
Marisha: So that was 21?
Taliesin: My brain is not doing numbers for some reason.
Marisha: I know, and I keep looking at you.
Matt: Against you, Grog... It hits you regardless. It has advantage on you because you're averting your gaze, plus you had your reckless attack last round. It still only rolls a nine, plus six, so that's 14? 15 to hit.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: This one bites out towards you, and even though it's not there, because it's so bright, you see it shift, and you (boom) hit it in the front of its snout with the base of your sword. That brings us to the top of the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome. So it's the glowing one, I get advantage on the attack, because it's glowing?
Matt: You do, yes.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Okay, so Hunter's Mark moves over.
Laura: I'm going to avert my gaze, and roll a regular attack then? Since it's advantage?
Matt: Yes. It cancels out the disadvantage. So roll your first attack against it.
Laura: That's 31.
Matt: 31 hits, yeah.
Laura: 15 plus Hunter's Mark-- Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark it.
Matt: Yeah, you did.
Taliesin: Yeah, you did.
Laura: Okay! What did I say, 15? 18.
Matt: 18, all right. So the first arrow strikes into it. It's still standing. It's looking a little hurt, but it's still standing.
Laura: And then do I still get regular attacks? This is at disadvantage.
Matt: Disadvantage on the next one, yeah.
Laura: 19?
Matt: Yeah. What's your total? 19 with disadvantage? That does hit, yep.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18, all right. This arrow, however, manages to strike through the top of the head, stapling the mouth shut, and it falls to the ground as its eyes slowly glaze over.
Laura: I roar from up in the tree!
Taliesin: Wait, do you let go of the broom to roar?
Laura: No, I hold the broom in my hand!
Marisha: Katy Perry style.
Laura: Defying Gravity style.
Liam: Holding it in your hand while you're flying on it?
Laura: I'm not flying, I'm in a tree, dude.
Matt: Yeah, she's clutched up on top of a tree.
Liam: I'm not looking at you.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan. Are you averting your gaze or not?
Sam: I'm not only averting my gaze, I'm looking towards the holes that it came out of, any of the holes that are near me.
Matt: There's two that are near you.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to go over to one and throw a Fireball down into it.
Matt: Okay! So, Scanlan, you walk over to the nearby holes behind you, where the one that snuck up behind you essentially came out of, aim down, and make sure you mark off these charges for each use of the wand.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: You (whoosh) release the beam, which gets about 15, 20 feet down before it blasts. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: Like putting yourself at the mouth of a cannon.
Sam: Seven.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Roll 8d6. But take half damage, because it's mostly guarded and this is a circumstantial, at the outskirts of it, you're not taking the full brunt of the Fireball. However, you do get caught in the very edge of the backblast.
Sam: 29.
Matt: So you take half that. So you take 15 points of fire damage and are blown about five feet backward onto the ground. However, the ground shudders beneath all your feet, and the earth, the wet damp earth (squelch) sinks inward and the tunnel collapses. A few of the others (squelch) into it. There's still a couple more on the opposite side that are open. There's two more on this side that are open.
Sam: So the tunnels nearest me are not accessible anymore.
Matt: The two that were there and there both, the ground from it shuddering, collapsed inward, and now the mud has filled the space. There's these small sinkholes where they were.
Sam: All right. I'll spend the rest of my time in this round licking my wounds and studying the obelisk to see if I can see any other clues or anything on it.
Matt: Okay. You can see the text that she saw upon there, the Elvish script.
Sam: I can't read it, though.
Matt: But you see it there, and you see the triangle, a dark recessed triangle about that big that is in the base of it.
Sam: Is it a hole, or is it...?
Matt: It's a hole, but it's carved. It's not a perfect triangle, it starts as a triangle and slowly, as it recesses inward, comes to a point towards the back.
Taliesin: Like a reverse pyramid.
Sam: I throw a snowball in it.
Matt: (impact)
Sam: It's safe, guys.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I'm off the map, but I want to try to come down towards the tree that I think Percy's at. He's between two trees. I'm going to avert my gaze, I'm going to look at the ground, come up around the side of that tree, and I'm listening for scorpion clacking and basilisk hissing, and I'm going to throw, dagger dagger dagger, in the direction of the basilisk I hear near scorpion claws clutching. Does that make sense?
Matt: Mm-hmm.
Liam: All right. So this is at disadvantage because I'm looking at the ground. So first one is... first one is a 21.
Matt: 21 hits.
Liam: And second one is... 19?
Matt: Hits.
Liam: Third one is 16.
Matt: Hits. These are not with Sharpshooter?
Liam: No, not at all. So we've got ten, plus nine, plus ten.
Matt: With that, your final dagger hits in the side of its rib cage, and the creature slumps over on the ground, letting out a horrible, gurgling hiss as it slowly dies amongst the mud.
Liam: Daredevil.
Laura: Was that all of them?
Matt: Currently, yes. Make a perception check.
Laura: Okay. Oh, I roll with advantage, because I'm in the forest! Oh my god, I rolled a one twice in a fucking row. I see nothing.
Sam: Two natural ones?
Marisha: We are fucking eating it on rolls tonight.
Matt: You're about to look down to inspect the vicinity. However, the tree is starting to bow forward and you (grunt) have to catch yourself, and you have no chance to even survey the territory.
Taliesin: Pine sap gets in your eye.
Liam: Laura Bailey dies on stream.
Travis: I rolled a 16.
Matt: As you take a moment, the rage still in, you can hear the blood pumping in your ears, but you also hear the (hiss) rising hissing, what sounds like a distant echo coming up from a subterranean tunnel.
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Subterranean tunnel?
Travis: Yeah. That Fireball, I think it might have pissed them off.
Sam: Good.
Marisha: Can I use my blindsight tremorsense to see if I can feel how far away they are?
Matt: You do. You feel beneath the ground. It's less of a tremorsense, more being able to sense the vibrations in the air around you. You can tell that there is motion coming from underneath.
Marisha: Sounds like a lot of them?
Matt: A few more.
Ashley: Fireball the other holes?
Marisha: I'm going to drop my scorpion form.
Sam: Oh, god, Keyleth, you're horrible! Oh, wait, no, you've turned back to normal.
Marisha: The things you say, Scanlan. I'm just going to do a Wall of Stone, flat over the area with the holes.
Matt: So from the stone chunks and portions of the shattered bodies that litter part of this garden, a giant stone wall forms around them and builds over it, sealing these holes. Eventually you hear a (knocking) (reptilian snarl) scraping sounds.
Sam: They're friendly!
Liam: "I can't breathe down here!"
Matt: They're not budging it, they're just hitting it from underneath, and it's getting more frantic as time goes on.
Sam: How long can you hold that?
Marisha: It'll last until they bust out of it, so we either keep moving or figure out where we're going from here.
Sam: What is this obelisk? It seems important if these things are protecting it.
Laura: What does it say?
Marisha: It has writing in Elvish in it.
Sam: What does it say?
Marisha: It says, a name is earned, in Elvish.
Sam: Should we say a name to it and see what happens?
Matt: One of the stone parts of the wall begins to crack from underneath.
Laura: Didn't Osysa say something about, her mate wouldn't say its name?
Sam: That's right, that's right.
Laura: And this is a symbol of Ioun.
Travis: Should we say Ioun in Elvish?
Marisha: I say Ioun in Elvish.
Matt: You say it out into the air.
Sam: Why don't you say it into this triangle hole over here?
Marisha: Ioun!
Laura: Say knowledge in Elvish.
Marisha: Knowledge!
Sam: Elvish is just English except muffled.
Marisha: I'm going in the triangle hole!
Matt: A moment passes.
Marisha: Osysa! Sphinx!
Laura: A name is earned.
Travis: What's in the hole?
Marisha: What's in the hole?
Sam: I don't know what's in the hole. Nothing.
Matt: A basilisk face bursts through the stone wall.
Sam: Whack-a-Mole! Grog! Whack-a-Mole!
Travis: Can I run over and play golf?
Matt: Yeah. Do you want to avert your gaze or not?
Travis: Nah.
Matt: All right, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Shite.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Without an issue, the eyes find yours and you just grin as you bring... what kind of attacks do you want to do?
Travis: Reckless and Great Weapon Master.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Travis: That's a natural 20. I'll take that one on the first one.
Matt: Okay, and the other one?
Travis: 19. 20.
Matt: Both hit. The first is a critical. This would be over here.
Travis: 31?
Matt: Did you roll the... Is that times two?
Travis: No, that's just the attack.
Liam: It's critical.
Matt: Before you add your modifier.
Travis: Before the modifier? It was 12 before the modifier.
Matt: So 24 plus the modifier.
Travis: Which is 32, plus ten is 42.
Matt: 42. Did you roll the additional brutal critical rolls?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: So roll 4d6 on top of that, because of your brutal critical. I think it is.
Liam: I think we can all agree it's the jelly of the month club at this point.
Travis: 17.
Matt: For a grand total of...
Sam: 59?
Laura: Do you double those ones though, because it's the dice?
Travis: That's just the first hit.
Matt: Yeah, all right. 59 points of damage. You square up.
Travis: Happy Gilmore-style.
Matt: You strike down with the blade at an angle, using the stone holding it in place like an executioner's block, and the blade scrapes against the stone as you strike, finding itself embedding about seven to eight inches into the throat of the basilisk as its head's protruding out. Immediately, blood begins to pour out of its side, and it's gurgling at its attempt to try and push through. You wedge the blade out. Go for your next strike. You already rolled your attack, which was a 19, so roll damage on that one.
Travis: Seven, 12, 20, 30, on the second one.
Liam: Oh, that's all?
Matt: With the second strike, you (whoosh) clean slice. The head (splat) onto the stonework there, the body still wedging the hole shut. The neck is a clean cut, and starts gouting blood out.
Travis: I dip the tip of the sword into the little well and I pick up the head.
Matt: Which, by the way, both saving throws were failed, so you gain another plus two to strength.
Sam: Wow, you're catching up to Pike!
Laura: Ow! Nothing.
Taliesin: Did you cut yourself on your cup?
Laura: No, I just hit my tooth.
Marisha: Oh, I hate that.
Taliesin: Oh, I hate that.
Matt: All right, so you can feel the impact still attempting from beneath growing more and more frantic.
Marisha: I say, earned!
Ashley: Can I go collect some of the (stuttering) basilisk-- I can't say that. Can I get some of the blood and collect it?
Matt: Sure. And you notice that the longer it stays out there, the blood itself is beginning to freeze in the general atmosphere and get slushy.
Laura: We can get some and put it in my bag. It keeps things good.
Ashley: Can I stab the carcass then in another area and get some fresh in the body?
Matt: Yeah, there's plenty of carcasses of basilisks around. As they're inspecting, and you still feel the impacts from underneath the stone wall from the other tunnel, you manage to gather, we'll say two small vials of basilisk blood.
Ashley: Vex!
Travis: Yeah, put it in Vex's little refrigerator Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay. The slamming on the other side of the stone wall slowly subsides until silence comes.
Marisha: Did they give up?
Travis: Has anybody put their hand in the hole yet?
Laura: It's all you, Grog.
Travis: All right, I put my hand in the hole.
Matt: Where the one you killed is?
Travis: No, the triangle.
Matt: Okay. So you take your hand and you place it inside this empty recess in the obelisk. It reaches in, and the shadow of the obelisk completely takes it to the wrist. Nothing happens.
Sam: I'm going to take my Ioun Stone and shove it in the hole.
Matt: Okay. You take the Ioun Stone and place it in the hole, and it has a soft light that it gives off naturally from the magical enchantment, and it lights the inside of the dark recess, and as you place it inside, the top of the obelisk begins to glow ever-so-faintly, like a little beacon. The very top of the stone glows a matching color to your stone.
Marisha: A matching color?
Matt: Yeah. I need you all to make a perception check.
Sam: 17.
Marisha: 14.
Liam: 16.
Travis: 19!
Laura: 25.
Taliesin: 11.
Sam: Ashley Blindsight?
Ashley: 16!
Matt: Okay. You catch a little bit of this, Grog, and you perk up as you notice, and you see immediately. There is a matching beacon, a faint glow that appears to be streaking down the mountainside in the distance. It's a little bit off-center from the direct south direction that you're facing, but there is a slight marker, very faintly visible on the mountain range, just visible over the treetops.
Laura: I drop a pin in that, and I tell Keyleth, now you can use that thing!
Marisha: I hold up the Hunk of Quall.
Laura: No, I mean your spell, Keyleth. Fastest way to get to this point!
Marisha: I didn't bring it because everyone said not to learn that spell.
Sam: That was today, wasn't it?
Laura: I thought you already learned it.
Marisha: He said to learn something else because it wasn't going to be useful.
Laura: No, he said just don't use that thing!
Marisha: No, you said to learn something, it was at the beginning of the day!
Sam: You can't unlearn things! It's all good.
Laura: It's okay, it's okay. I can see it.
Matt: You had it already memorized when you guys got to the edge of the forest, I'm pretty sure.
Marisha: Okay. I thought you were saying to pick something else because it wouldn't be handy. But I take it back, and I'll use it now if you want.
Taliesin: No, we're good. We're good.
Marisha: I'm so confused.
Matt: Up to you.
Marisha: Is it me tonight?
Taliesin: It is a really weird pot of coffee. It's not just you.
Marisha: Do I need sleep? What am I missing?
Matt: It's all good.
Marisha: I can keep it.
Travis: Just lick your finger and stick it in the wind.
Laura: Just use the spell and pretend that you never unlearned it.
Marisha: I never unlearned it! It's been there the whole time! I didn't use it. It's not like I used a 6th-level spell. Look, guys! Find the Path! That way!
Matt: Okay. So what is it that you're focusing on for the spell?
Marisha: That beam of light!
Laura: That I pointed out to her.
Marisha: That she pointed out. Am I doing this wrong?
Matt: No, you're not doing it wrong! You cast the spell and, concentrating on the source of this beacon, you feel the direction that would pull you the best way to travel towards that beacon is to travel towards that beacon.
Liam: Look, you're just doing what the bossy half-elf told you to do. Just go with it.
Marisha: What, that one?
Liam: That's the only bossy half-elf here.
Sam: DM, can I experiment and take away, if I take away my Ioun Stone, does the light fade?
Matt: As you pull the Ioun Stone out of it, the beacon does fade, yes. But you have a direction.
Marisha: I have it marked now. I have a pin in it. Right, that counts?
Matt: Right. No matter where you travel in this place, you will have a directional position towards that beacon.
Laura: See, there we go.
Marisha: Fucking handy, that one is.
Travis: Yep, redemption.
Marisha: Totally a great 6th-level spell I'm going to use all the time going forward.
Liam: Oh, for fuck's sake. Here we go, people. Here we go. And we're moving.
Travis: We take off at a jog now!
Sam: Wait, before we leave, is there anything else we need to do here? Do we need to go down into the tunnels? Do we need to piss on the obelisk? Do we want to do anything?
Liam: You should piss on the obelisk just to be sure.
Taliesin: You should lick it, too, after you piss on it.
Travis: Let's not.
Sam: Let's go.
Matt: Are you guys leaving?
Sam: Wait, we need some basilisk blood and stuff!
Laura: We got some!
Matt: You're standing amongst the obelisk, a long series of mud with a bunch of mostly together stone statues of people and pieces of people around.
Travis: Do we want to check the other building ruins? We didn't check those at all. There's a whole corner of a building over there.
Laura: Sure.
Travis: Well, go check it!
Laura: I go look at it.
Liam: Half-elves look at the building structure.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: What the hot holy fuck.
Liam: 26.
Taliesin: It says it was forged by dwarves, that's all I can understand.
Laura: Investigation?
Matt: Investigation, yeah.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 19, all right. You guys both start gathering around the sides of the ruin. Glancing about the outside, it looks like at one point it was a smaller structure, probably part of the construction, like this here was a satellite place of worship for Ioun, like a beacon as part of a journey. But nothing about it catches your eyes. As you're stepping over the remnants of the stone individuals on the ground, you catch your eye on one of the individuals you see, lying partially submerged in the snow and mud. You glance down and see two arms that are out like this, although the right arm from the elbow down is missing. It's broken off in stone. Both are reaching out. A young human male, shortish brown hair, spectacles at the end of his nose, thin body and tucked-in, nice buttoned shirt. Slacks. This is Tyriok, the mapmaker.
Liam: The mapmaker?
Taliesin: You're a terrible person.
Laura: No, why would you do that, Matthew?
Matt: I didn't do this! He was travelling the world to take notes, people!
Liam: I take... Wait! Everybody shush! I look at him for a moment and then I leave him, and I don't tell anyone else.
Marisha: What?
Sam: We have Pike with us!
Liam: I don't tell anyone else. Pike didn't see him. His arm is broken off! You don't fucking know he exists. He's gone.
Ashley: But, but!
Laura: That's terrible!
Taliesin: Why don't you two just write a sequel to Batman/Superman while you're at it? Just destroy everything. I don't care anymore.
Laura: We could heal him!
Matt: You don't know. Eventually, after you guys do a perusal of the ruins, you find your way back to the party and you guys continue travelling which way, towards the beacon?
Laura: Towards the beacon!
Marisha: I've got it in my head now.
Liam: Wait, wait, wait, I go to Pike. I go to Pike. Pike.
Ashley: Yeah? Hi, Vax!
Liam: Do you remember that mapmaker? Were you with us? So much shit has happened. Do you remember Tyriok the mapmaker?
Ashley: I don't think I was with you.
Liam: There's a man over there. His arm is gone. Can you fix stoning? Can you fix a man who's been turned to stone?
Ashley: I can try. Remember one time we fixed Vex, when she was turned to stone, the last time we fought the basilisks.
Liam: Two years ago, yeah. What did we do?
Ashley: We covered her in basilisk blood.
Liam: I need to take a walk. Could you do that? Could you do that?
Ashley: Sure. Which stone is he?
Liam: Look over there by that tree there. Do you see him? There's two hands pointing towards the sky.
Sam: One hand.
Liam: Two.
Ashley: One and a half. All right, can I head over there?
Matt: You walk over there, and you do see a number of broken body parts all turned to stone in various states of disuse and crumbling. You do see a young man who's caught with his arms out, one broken off at the elbow, staring up, glasses at the end of his nose, looking both frightened and frozen in a moment of complete unaware danger.
Ashley: Okay. Can I try covering him in some of the basilisk's blood?
Matt: Sure. You take one of the vials that you collected and take the basilisk blood and pour it over the statue. The blood congeals and spills over, crystallizing slowly as the ice cold gets to it. It doesn't seem to have an effect.
Ashley: It's been too long.
Matt: You gather, based on the last time it happened, the blood needs to be applied within a short period of time after the person turns to stone. Do you have anything else that might help?
Ashley: Probably Greater Restoration.
Matt: Do you have that prepared?
Ashley: I do.
Matt: You concentrate, grasping the symbol of Sarenrae around your neck and touch your hand out. The warm glow of Sarenrae's divine energy transferring into the stone form. The form glows with energy, and the glow subsides and fades, the stone texture of his body beginning to slowly soften, and the color returning to his skin, and for a moment the head seems to shake, and the eyes clarify, and a voice begins to peek through these previously frozen vocal cords. "I mean no--" (screams) As all of a sudden his arm begins to spray gouts of blood.
Travis: I got it! I got it! I start catching it with the sword.
Matt: (stuttering) He turns to you, and sprays right across your face.
Travis: Good! Splash on! Yes!
Matt: "Help! Help me!"
Ashley: I grab his arm and Cure Wounds! I don't know if that's a really good move.
Matt: Go ahead and heal him up a bit.
Ashley: Can I try to reattach his arm?
Matt: You gather that might have been something to do before you had restored him.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: However, go ahead and heal for Cure Wounds. Roll a d8 plus five.
Travis: That's kind of fucking hilarious.
Ashley: 5d8 plus five?
Matt: Depending on what level you want to use on him. A level one is 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Oh, God, okay. I feel like I'm using all this, but I don't know. Okay, so let's do level five.
Matt: Level five. All right, go for it. 5d8 plus five.
Taliesin: Not our finest hour. Pretty reasonable hour, but it's definitely not the finest. We brought most of a mapmaker back.
Matt: So how much is that?
Ashley: 29.
Matt: 29, okay. As you reach out and grasp the edge of his bleeding stump...
Ashley: Stop moving!
Matt: "I just--" (yelps) The warmth causes the pain to fade and he calms for a second. "Oh. Sorry." He looks down as the wound has stopped bleeding, skin is scabbed over, and it looks like it's now in a place where it's no longer an open wound. It is mostly healed over, though he is now missing part of his arm.
Laura: Can you regrow his little arm like you regrew my brother's little nubbin of a toe?
Matt: This is a bit beyond your healing capabilities.
Travis: C'mon, Deadpool hand.
Matt: At which point he goes, "Thank you, small one. I--" And he goes to reach up for his glasses and... Other hand.
Laura: Oh, we're terrible.
Taliesin: Technically saved seven-eighths of a mapmaker.
Matt: He looks around at the rest of you. "Oh! Hello, it's been a while. We haven't... Well, I seem to have gotten myself in a bit of a predicament."
Sam: What happened?
Matt: "Well, I was... Well, I had two escorts. And I had been making my way through most of Tal'Dorei, and had gotten as far as this region, and... That's all I remember."
Laura: Basilisks? Big lizard creatures?
Matt: "Yes. Very scary. I tried to run, and that's all I remember."
Laura: Was it just the three of you, then? Not a large group of people?
Matt: "No, just three of us."
Ashley: What were you doing over here?
Matt: "I was trying to finish this portion of the map. If I... Ah!" And he goes over and reaches through some of the snow and pulls up a large stone bag that is currently still attached to his broken arm.
Taliesin: No!
Matt: "Um. Is this...?"
Travis: Nope! No, no, that's just part of a-- It was a statue garden, it's not a big deal. It's just a fragment.
Matt: "All right. Well, these were my maps."
Sam: Are they stone?
Matt: They are stone, currently.
Laura: Can we-- Oh, no.
Travis: Is he on the ground still?
Matt: No, he's standing. "Oh boy." He takes his glasses off and goes to rub them into his shirt and... does it with one hand and puts them back on.
Ashley: Oh, buddy.
Laura: I feel terrible.
Matt: "Well."
Taliesin: It's like a one-legged duck walking around.
Matt: "What do I do?"
Travis: Which hand does he have, his left?
Matt: He has his left hand.
Travis: Are you right-handed?
Matt: "I'm kind of ambidextrous."
Travis: Thank gods for that.
Laura: That's good, that's good. Well...
Taliesin: A lot's happened.
Matt: There's shock on his face. He still hasn't quite taken in all of this stuff.
Sam: Everything is going to be okay.
Marisha: Well, you have a great story now.
Taliesin: And a period of adjustment.
Matt: "This is very true. This is a valid point."
Taliesin: We should send him back to the encampment.
Laura: It's like a two-day walk.
Sam: These escorts you had with you who were also turned to stone, were they important to you? Were they friends of yours?
Matt: "I hired them as part of this endeavor. They were nice fellows. Hold on a second." He starts walking off and starts rummaging through the pieces of stone and various people, picking up heads. "No. Well, that's Alex. Golly, I don't... I don't know where Gerald is, but... Can I come with you for now?"
Laura: Well, you're more than-- Actually--
Travis: No.
Laura: He's rather smart, isn't he?
Sam: He has knowledge of the area.
Taliesin: That actually could be useful.
Laura: Here's the thing. It's very dangerous, dear, and it's quite possible you might be turned into stone again.
Matt: "I don't want that."
Laura: No, we don't want that for you, either.
Travis: Also eaten alive, burned, shot, stabbed--
Laura: Straight-up killed.
Travis: -- pulled apart, maimed--
Laura: Beheaded.
Travis: -- Lacerated.
Laura: All options.
Travis: But that's just in the mornings.
Laura: But you're more than welcome to join us, for a short amount of time. Or you can head back to a camp that's about a day and a half away.
Matt: "All right. Whereabouts are you going?"
Travis: We're heading up the mountain.
Matt: I'll head for the camp.
Travis: Are you sure? We could always use you as a decoy-- I mean, as an aid.
Matt: "I'm good. I'm all right. Thank you, though. I appreciate the offer. I have a lot to think about."
Marisha: I could...
Taliesin: Well, we'll run into him when we get back.
Travis: Do you need a hand finding your way to the encampment?
Sam: Oh, Grog.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Liam: Groan.
Matt: He starts walking northward, basically trailing past the path where you guys walked from.
Laura: I feel like we should help him or something.
Liam: Not bad enough to actually do it, though, right?
Marisha: I have Conjure Woodland Beings in my back pocket today, so I could conjure you a little posse to escort you.
Laura: That would be good!
Liam: Have some squirrels, buddy.
Marisha: Have a little posse.
Matt: What's the duration on that one?
Marisha: I don't know. That's something else that I haven't done, ever.
Sam: Untested high-level spell? Do it!
Marisha: That always works so well.
Matt: It's an hour of concentration.
Travis: Is this as far as you got, or did you make it up the mountain previously?
Matt: "I was cresting through the base of the mountain, and made it most of the way down the Stormcrest and was heading back through the Frostweald."
Travis: Oh, you've been up there already?
Laura: You've been to the base of the Stormcrest Mountains!
Matt: "I was kind of along the side. We were trying to make our way through the central portion of the mountain pass so we could keep track of the division of topography on both top and bottom."
Travis: Oh, man. Why you didn't say so? We could really use your help here.
Laura: Actually, did you see something similar to this obelisk at the base of the mountain?
Matt: "Uh..." He looks back and thinks to himself. "Not quite like this, though, but there are a number of cavern entrances that litter various portions of the base of the mountain."
Travis: Did you go in any of them?
Matt: "No, see, I was afraid those would be too dangerous. So I went into the forest."
Travis: Right.
Matt: "Anyway."
Travis: Well, look, you don't really seem to have a lot on you. Why don't you join us for just a little bit, to the areas that he knows, and then we'll send you back on your way, maybe with a bit of ale, a little bit of food? Maybe a weapon?
Matt: "That would be fantastic. And... Thank you. I realize now that if you hadn't come by, I probably would have been there forever."
Laura: Yes, well, we're sorry about the arm, dear.
Matt: "There are worse things. And I can retrain to write with this arm. It's totally fine."
Sam: Yes. You're lucky to be alive, and now you're going on an adventure with us. Hey, who has two thumbs and is really excited? You and me, both doing this.
Matt: You know what, make a charisma check.
Taliesin: You worry me.
Sam: Charisma?
Matt: Yeah, add your plus five charisma bonus.
Sam: 20.
Matt: 20? As you do that, he... "Yeah. You're right! You're right. I'm thankful to be alive today, and it's because of you guys."
Liam: Technically true.
Matt: "Let's travel!"
Travis: Well, listen, I'll walk with you. Lead the way.
Matt: "All right, so where are you going? Because this place was dangerous, and that place is dangerous, and we don't want to go that way."
Travis: Yeah, Vex'ahlia will point where we're headed.
Laura: Why don't you want to go that way? Have you seen orcs in this wood?
Matt: He points and says, "There's a lot of them that way. We came through here to avoid them, and that's when this all happened."
Laura: Ooh. Actually, we should probably take care of the orcs.
Taliesin: Get the orcs really quick, and then we can send him back with the refugees from there.
Marisha: We did say we were going to take care of the orcs.
Laura: Yes, we did.
Marisha: We did promise that.
Laura: What do you say, Grog? Would you like to kill some orc?
Travis: Do you always ask questions to which you know the answer already?
Laura: Would you like to stay here while we fight the orcs, or could you walk us towards them and stay hidden?
Matt: "I don't want to stay here."
Laura: Then you come with us, and then you stay very, very hidden.
Matt: "I can do that. I can definitely do that."
Taliesin: When it's time, he can hide with the bear. Then a bear will be hiding with a mapmaker, or most of a mapmaker.
Sam: We'll be fine. Let's go.
Matt: "All right."
Liam: While all of that happened, for the last ten minutes, can I stealth away for a little bit?
Matt: Sure. Roll a stealth check.
Liam: 31.
Matt: Okay. Based on passive perception, nobody notices your exit.
Liam: I don't want to go that far, I want to go so I can still hear all this bullshit behind me, and find a quiet spot... I know you can hear me. I'm going to need... I'm going to need more than nightmares. A deal has been struck, and I will honor it. I need to understand what this is. Any time.
Matt: In that moment, the white snow suddenly flashes to dark, and it's like you were struck blind. You gasp instinctually as your vision goes dark, nothing, and you see come from the shadow, another flash, another vision. It's of Vasselheim. Another flash. You look out and you can see there's one large, darkened structure that you have not visited but passed by on the southeastern side of Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah! Temple! Temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: The actual name of this, and you've heard it in passing before, when you were given your initial pass over of the... I'm trying to find the specific name here so I don't mess it up. It's in here somewhere. You see this dark, obsidian structure that is ridged, almost like an even rib cage along each side. It is ominous, and it stuck out in the middle of the city because, amongst the rest of the jovial atmosphere, it loomed over the Amaranthine Oubliette. But this was the central temple to the Raven Queen. You then flash once again, in a long chamber, and you see veils, dark veils passing by, one after another, after another. Another flash forward, and you see a chamber with dark brown, smooth floors. You see gold trim along large pillars that reach up to a dome-type stained glass ceiling of amber colors and white, and in the center of this chamber you see what appears to be a pool of still, crimson liquid. You see the crimson liquid shift, and a form rises up out of it. An arm rises up and beckons a finger. Your vision goes to black, and you're back in the forest.
Liam: Fuck. Not exactly what I was talking about. At some point, a little bit of clarification. Congratulations, you're creepy as fuck. We'll work it out. I head back to the group.
Sam: Good talk.
Matt: As you guys gather yourselves, your new companion, and start heading in the direction that he ushered you within the Frostweald, towards where supposedly these orcs have holed up and made their camp, you know that the good news is, you probably have the element of surprise in this, but you're not entirely sure what it is you're in for when you get there. That's where I'll end today's session. (groaning)
Laura: That was a lot of sidetracks on this particular adventure.
Matt: That's all right. Sidetracks make it fun.
Taliesin: Nothing wrong with sidetrack.
Liam: Heebie-jeebies.
Laura: Oh, man, she's creepy!
Ashley: Creepy as fuck!
Laura: Creepy as fuck!
Sam: Hey, Pike, good job tonight, lady!
Travis: Hey, Pikey!
Sam: You brought a guy back to life!
Laura: 19 strength, say what!
Sam: You're super strong!
Ashley: I'm a tank.
Travis: Tank up in this motherfucker.
Liam: (bang! bang! bang!)
Ashley: It feels so good to be back.
Matt: I know. Come back to us soon! Physically!
Laura: Yes, please!
Ashley: Yes, very soon! A few more weeks, a few more weeks.
Travis: She's coming, she's coming.
Liam: We need our Pike.
Matt: All right, guys. We'll pick this up next Thursday! Thank you for coming and watching us play around, make believe on the Internet.
Sam: Is next week any-- It's not our 50th episode?
Liam: It's our 49th!
Laura: Next week is our 49th, two weeks from now is our 50th.
Matt: 21st is our 50th episode.
Sam: Last time in our 40s.
Marisha: Got to enjoy it now.
Travis: And don't miss the 50th.
Matt: Don't miss the 50th, it's going to be fun.
Laura: May be a couple surprises in store.
Matt: We'll see.
Travis: Nothing. Just us.
Matt: I don't know where we'll be in the story, because that's definitely based on whatever you guys do. But we'll have some fun things here.
Liam: Shopping episode.
Matt: Yep. But yeah, thank you guys so much! See you next Thursday. Those of you in Pittsburgh, we'll see you this weekend. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, and good evening everyone, to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight's going to be an interesting evening based on how we left off last week, so we'll get to that here in a moment. First and foremost, let's get through our announcements. At the top, we are excited. This episode and the episodes of this month are brought to you by our new sponsor for this month, Loot Crate. (cheering)
Matt: Me and Marisha have been Loot Crate--
Marisha: --purveyors for like three years.
Matt: But they've been awesome enough and interested in helping us sponsor this next month of content, so that being the case, if we want to go ahead and open some of these boxes real fast, and see, so you're aware of the kind of stuff that Loot Crate does. While they're opening this, Loot Crate is a monthly subscription box service that's 20 bucks a month and you get six to eight unique items that are based on a specific theme every month.
Laura: Leeloo Dallas Multipass!
Taliesin: This is the one that comes with the Harry Potter socks.
Laura: Sorry, Matt, you were talking.
Matt: That's okay. You guys show off what you got.
Liam: I have a little cute facehugger for the face.
Marisha: Yes, a drinking horn!
Sam: I got a shofar! I'm still saying we should rename the show Crate-ical Role for this month. I'm just saying.
Matt: No, I'm good. I'm good on that, thank you.
Taliesin: This fabulous Labyrinth t-shirt, which Travis is sporting.
Travis: I think if David Bowie can't keep you alive, I don't know what can. Original War of the Worlds and The Day the Earth Stood Still prints?
Matt: So, the cool thing about this is, they send you a new crate every month that has a certain theme and the content in that is based around that theme. If you go to www.lootcrate.com/criticalrole, you can enter the code 'criticalrole', one word, to save $3 on your new subscription, so if you're thinking about it and you want to try it out for a little while, go ahead and use our code and get yourself a nice little discount, which is rad.
Liam: The other neat thing about Loot Crate boxes is you can turn them inside out and they become something. This one's an arcade machine.
Marisha: This one's got a maze on the inside.
Taliesin: I keep all my stuff in these boxes.
Marisha: Yeah, they're good storage boxes. Or regifting boxes.
Matt: That the invasion box?
Travis: Yeah. There's an invasion box, a quest box, and a power box, but we don't have that yet.
Matt: Not yet, power box, I think, is this month.
Ashley: There's so much X-Files stuff in here. This is awesome.
Matt: (laughs) That was a good month.
Laura: I think May is World of Warcraft, DBZ. It's got all these amazing things and I was like, I'm a part of all of these things and I want it!
Matt: I like how it's essentially a really tiny pre-stream Critmas.
Sam: Guys, you could watch us open stuff all night.
Matt: I've already lost control of the episode.
Travis: Go to Loot Crate, click the link. Show some love.
Matt: So, yeah, lootcrate.com/criticalrole. You can put in 'criticalrole' as your code there and you'll get 3% off your subscription.
Marisha: $3 off.
Matt: Or yeah, sorry, $3, not 3%. Much better than 3%. I'm so stupid. $3. It's awesome. Thank you, Loot Crate! Next announcement we have, for those who missed it previously, it is now available: the latest issue of Rat Queens, in which Vox Machina make a cameo appearance during a certain bar-crawl portion of the issue. And some wayward bard ends up trying to buy a drink for one of the members.
Travis: He's got glorious hair, though.
Matt: He has glorious hair, which, mine is shorter now, but it'll grow. Don't worry, those of you who freaked out. I've already gotten people who're like, "You cut it!" and I'm like, "It's hair! I live in the Valley where it's hot."
Laura: Well, it's not really hot right now.
Matt: Yeah, not today. Today, the weather's been nice. So, yeah, next up on the list, Taliesin. Supposedly, for those who haven't seen it, the next run on Signal Boost, the show that Marisha writes and produces for, has a new person hosting the next series of episodes.
Taliesin: Who's hosting the new series-- Oh, fuck. I'd better start working on that right now. Oh. It's going to be great. No, I'm having a lot of fun. We're putting it together, and--
Marisha: It's going to be weird. We're going even weirder. So for everyone who already hates how weird it is, buckle up.
Matt: All right, so, look for that. All right. Also, there is a new series of Geek and Sundry website content coming up called Ask Vox Machina, in which Vox Machina members have been written to by various people living in the world of Tal'Dorei, asking how to solve their problems. Our wondrous players here are answering them in character. I believe the first one is going to be Sam, right?
Sam: Yeah, Scanlan got some great letters from the fans, and he replied with some award-winning advice. So, check that out tomorrow on geekandsundry.com.
Taliesin: Participation awards all around.
Matt: (laughs) Did you say anticipation awards?
Taliesin: Participation.
Matt: Oh, I like anticipation awards, too. There's a video game that some people may have heard of called Uncharted 4 that's coming out. Reviews have been coming out and everyone's giving it the best game of forever.
Laura: It's amazing!
Matt: So, and I believe one of our own Vox Machina plays a rather awesome role in that, Laura? (cheering)
Matt: Nadine Ross in the story.
Laura: Yeah, she's a villain, so you get to face off with her. It's really fun.
Matt: That is exciting.
Liam: You are a good actor.
Matt: And in the multiplayer you might hear me try and kill you a couple times.
Liam: Yeah, kill him a lot for what he's about to do!
Sam: You also might hear me try to heal you a couple times.
Matt: Okay, so between us, we got you.
Laura: That's right, I remember when we were going in for multiplayer, it was like, we've got several members of Vox Machina as the multiplayer characters, which is pretty ridiculous.
Matt: Should be fun. All right. Also, we put the new full title intro on Facebook yesterday, so you guys can get it in hi-def glory at your request. And we've already hit a million views on it in a day.
Travis: (laughs) Which is weird.
Liam: Dungeons and Dragons!
Matt: It's a good time when you can dress up as your D&D characters for a weekend and people on Facebook are like, cool. Like, that's the weirdest thing ever.
Taliesin: A million people go, huh.
Matt: Huh. That's a thing. (laughs)
Laura: Although I did get made fun of already.
Matt: Did you?
Laura: Some fan pointed out that I looked stupid.
Matt: Did they really?
Sam: I wouldn't call that person a fan, necessarily.
Matt: They say that (funny voice) I love the intro but Laura Bailey looks stupid.
Laura: (fake cries)
Sam: I'm sorry I wrote that.
Laura: It was Sam.
Matt: All right, last couple things here. The title song actually for that intro, written by our wondrous friend of the show, Jason Charles Miller, who you saw play as Garthok, the half-orc rogue a number of episodes back, who wrote our original theme and the new one, has it up on iTunes. So if you want to have the most badass, nerdy ringtone and/or music to play on repeat until you start bleeding out of your nose, that is now available on iTunes, so you can search for the Critical Role intro music. It's awesome. All right, Liam, you want to take it away?
Liam: We've come a long way to get here tonight. It's true we may die, and when our bones are turned to dust, carry them away in Wyrmwood gaming boxes, the finest wooden boxes for carrying the remains of the dead ever. They're great! Oh and you can put dice in 'em too, which is probably their intended purpose. And if you like them, they have many different kinds of woods, you go to wyrmwoodgaming.com. And if you want to pay for shipping, you can, but if you don't want to pay for shipping, use the code 'critrole'.
All: Critrole!
Liam: Feels so good. And you'll get free shipping. And then also, lastly, this is the last couple of hours for their kickstarter for the sentinel box. You can get our logo onto any box, like this, or you can get the real swag and get the master box. It looks like this on any wood. And you put your dice in it, cards in it.
Ashley: My favorite part of Wyrmwood Gaming is the magnets. Magnets, bitch! (laughter)
Matt: It's so satisfying.
Liam: So, that kickstarter, a couple more hours, then finito if you want to get in on that. Okay.
Matt: Cool. And last but not least on my list, it says 'death to all puppies'. I don't know who wrote that.
Travis: Who would write that?
Laura: It was you, Matt. It was you!
Matt: I'm going to assume it's Sam. It's usually Sam. All right. Well, then, let's go ahead and bring this down now to get in the mood for tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. So! Leaving off from last week's episode, the party of intrepid adventurers, Vox Machina, trying to save the whole of Tal'Dorei from the Chroma Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that have destroyed many of the main cities here, have gone about searching for items called the Vestiges of Divergence, magical artifacts from a war of ancient times that apparently hold some great power that could aid in defeating these dragons. One of which, apparently, is being held by Kevdak, the leader of the herd of roaming tribal barbaric individuals that Grog once belonged to, and had beaten the crap out of and left Grog for dead long ago. While the dragons had destroyed part of Westruun and left it behind, this tribe utilized that time to take over the town, enslaving or keeping most of the people under their thumb, and making an accord with the one black dragon, Umbrasyl, that is currently in a tenuous relationship right now with these herd members, Herd of the Storm, as they're known. You, having sent a few of them to their death via a trap on the outside, found your way into the city, saved some of the individuals that lived there, as well as Kaylie and Dr. Dranzel, and Grog went ahead and issued a challenge to the Herd to meet with Kevdak himself. After some fairly decent intimidation checks, it was agreed, and while most of the party stealthed behind, you made your way to the very center of the town square, where Kevdak leapt off the top of the ex-Margrave's homestead and the two of you began to do battle in a pit of spikes that was gathered in the center of the town square, surrounded by a number of the clan watching on. During this fight, it went back and forth a bit before Grog felt that this was a losing battle should it continue in this way and decided to, at least it seemed to me, call out to his friends for aid with the classic Shakespearean battle cry of, "Vox Machina, fuck shit up!"
Liam: That's from Coriolanus.
Matt: Oh, sorry, Coriolanus, thank you. And that is where we're picking up. So--
Sam: Before we go, I have to inspire everyone with this. (laughter)
Matt: Holy shit. What the-- what?
Taliesin: What are you? What the fuck are you? Oh my God!
Liam: I want a d10!
Sam: And look, Ashley's, like, somewhere, I can't even see.
Matt: Please tell me that was a gift from somebody.
Sam: No, I made this myself, because I wanted you all to know how passionate I was about tonight.
Liam: Sam? Could you kiss your right gun?
Ashley: Kiss it! Kiss it!
Sam: Mm. Tastes like strawberries. And sweat.
Matt: Inspiration granted and immediately taken away.
Travis: Do your pants also have photoshopped lightning coming out of the crotch?
Sam: No, my pants are just jeans.
Ashley: Wait, how far down does it go?
Sam: All the way, baby.
Matt: That's the first step of the process. The pants come soon.
Laura: Did you just do that at home with a--?
Sam: Yeah, I just penciled it in.
Matt: I can't even. That's a thing. All righty, so, with that, we are going into the realm of battle. Let's go ahead and kick on the proper music for this. So, with Vox Machina currently on the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of this building, we have the four archers that have appeared on the rooftop of the Margrave's house. We have most of the individuals that are surrounding this, along with the few innocents, which just for the sake of appearance, here, I will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few markers so you know who you're looking for, innocents-wise.
Liam: We're the innocents, Matt. We're the innocents.
Matt: No, you're not. Not anymore. All right, so, the red markers are going to act as markers for the innocent, just so you're aware.
Travis: Percy. Percy! Taliesin! You're on that roof, right?
Matt: Percy's over there. All righty, so, that all being the case, guys, as Grog shouted, at this moment the individuals in the center of the square start looking around, confused, not knowing where to come from. At this moment, a few of them manage to catch up a glance at the individuals that are on the rooftops. I need everyone to roll initiative, along with you, Grog, because combat has begun again at this point at the top.
Marisha: Wait, all of us?
Matt: All of you guys. This has started.
Taliesin: I mean, that's not amazing. That's better. 14.
Marisha: You're still ahead of me. You rolled a nat 20?
Ashley: Why's he laughing?
Travis: Because he's fucking evil.
Matt: 'Because he's fucking evil'? Is that what you said?
Travis: Who said that? I will beat him with my fists.
Matt: All right, so, for the sake of this one, we have 25 to 20.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 24.
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21, okay, so we have-- let's see.
Liam: All the people who wanted to go first are going first.
Matt: All right, 20 to 15?
Travis: 18.
Matt: All righty. 15 to ten.
Taliesin: 14.
Marisha: 13.
Ashley: 12.
Matt: Pike, getting into the double-digits!
Ashley: Oh, you know. Moving on up.
Taliesin: I'd rather have my low roll here than for anything else.
Laura: Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.
Travis: It's like a roller coaster. We're just going tick-tick-tick-tick-shooom.
Matt: A lot here I'm keeping track of, guys. All right, so, the surprise round affects all the archers. It affects everyone except for these four individuals, or these two individuals with the clubs, and these two women here with big swords, and Kevdak. So, top of the round, Vex.
Laura: Does the second story of the house that I'm in have windows? Can I see?
Matt: The second story does.
Laura: Can I run up the stairs, then, so I can get a better look at the playing field?
Matt: Actually, this one was supposed to go this way for the entrance point there. All right. So you are currently now looking out the side of the window.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to-- I'm already hiding, right?
Matt: Right, no one's seen you at this point.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to Hunter's Mark Kevdak. And I'm going to hold my turn--
Matt: Putting a green on him for the Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I'm going to hold my turn until it seems like he's better incapacitated or until something happens. I'm going to hold my turn.
Matt: Hold your action until--?
Laura: I think until Scanlan goes.
Matt: Okay, so that finishes your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Am I at a window as well, downstairs?
Matt: You are by a door.
Liam: Am I half on a street? In a door?
Matt: You're inside the house right now. The door is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in.
Liam: All right, I'm going to click my boots, crack the door a few inches, and I'm going to hold my turn until one of our magic-users pulls a trick or Kevdak takes a swing at Grog.
Matt: Okay. That'll end your current actions. The archers are surprised. They do not go. It is Kevdak's turn. Kevdak sees you shouting out. He rolled a natural 20 on his initiative.
Laura: No, he didn't! That's why you shook your fucking head.
Matt: Yeah. I was like, man, all right. Let's start this right.
Marisha: Fucking Wheaton!
Matt: They had Wheaton come in and touch all my stuff. All right, so he's going to go ahead and, seeing you shout like this, he looks about for a second. He's going to continue his rage. He glances about, looks over and he sees nothing immediately on the rooftops, but looks down at this individual now shouting out for help before him, prostrate, and he gives you a glance and says, "Well this seems real familiar, doesn't it, Strongjaw?" At which point he's going to go ahead and take two of his reckless attacks against you. That's going to be a 28 to hit.
Travis: I'll have to look, but I think it hits.
Matt: Yeah. Second attack is a 30 to hit.
Travis: These aren't Great Weapon Master, right?
Matt: No, these are not Great Weapon Master.
Laura: What is his attack fucking bonus?
Taliesin: At least ten.
Matt: You take 30 points of slashing damage, reduced to 15. And two points of necrotic damage, because it's not reduced. And second one's going to be 22 points of slashing damage, reduced to 11, and then five points of necrotic on top of that.
Sam: However, for the second slash, I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage.
Travis: Before he does that, you said 17 on the first one, 11 on the second attack, and how much necrotic on the second one?
Laura: Seven overall. Plus two necrotic on the first hit. Five necrotic on the second.
Matt: You might have to get a little bit closer to make sure that he can hear you.
Laura: Plus that would be giving away your hiding.
Matt: What're you going to do, Sam?
Sam: I step forward closer to him and I use Cutting Words.
Matt: Okay, you step to the very edge of the rooftop here.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of this, right there.
Sam: And I shout, oi, Kevdak! I have a message from the people of Westruun! And I moon him. (laughter)
Sam: And I say, kiss our metaphorical hairy arses!
Matt: Just like that on your shirt. As he brings around his axe for a second swing, he hears that and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny gnome butt up on the top. Continuing the swing, though, to attack. Go ahead and reduce the damage using your Cutting Words.
Sam: Ten, right?
Matt: Uh-huh.
Sam: Pff. One.
Matt: So you take ten points of slashing damage from that strike. Oh, you're wielding Mythcarver, so his next saving throw is at disadvantage, right?
Sam: Yes, it is.
Matt: Because you're not currently wielding your weapon, Kevdak's going to go ahead and take a step back and glance over at you, as he's going to move his fingers up and point towards the roof. And you see a bunch of the other entities and archers, whoosh, shift their attention over in your direction, Sam. All right, that finishes Kevdak's turn. Scanlan, you're up next. Actually, you do get an attack of opportunity on him with your fist. Because you're not holding your warhammer right now.
Travis: I rolled a five, plus what? My strength?
Matt: I mean, it's your strength modifier plus your proficiency modifier.
Travis: 13?
Matt: 13, no. You punch his back and it just hits off his muscle. All right. Sam, you're up.
Sam: Okay. From my crouched, butt-out position, whilst holding my Hand Cone of Clarity.
Matt: Where are you holding it?
Sam: It's shoved up there.
Liam: Between the legs, upside-down.
Sam: Before I make this attack, when I scanned around, did I see any of his allies without any weapons or carrying a staff or something like that?
Matt: No, they're all the type of people that would be at all times wielding something at their side. There are two individuals that you do notice, there is this one here, and there is Greenbeard right there, and they both appear to have some sort of a quarterstaff-type implement, but everything else is either bladed or giant clubs or some sort of big melee weapon.
Sam: But they're surprised anyway.
Matt: They are, yes.
Sam: Okay. Okay. Well, then, I will cast Hold Person at level three on Kevdak.
Matt: On Kevdak.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Oh boy.
Sam: At level three, so I get to target one other individual.
Matt: You would, yeah.
Sam: And I would target the beardy guy with the staff.
Matt: All right, Hold Person. For a minute, wisdom saving throw, for the duration. Okay.
Sam: Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage.
Matt: With disadvantage, yes, that is true. Kevdak. All right.
Sam: Because of Cutting Words.
Matt: He rolled a 19 and an eight. Taking the eight, that brings it to a ten, so that's a failure on him. (cheering)
Laura: For Hold Person, does it un-paralyze him if we hit him?
Sam: No. He's just paralyzed. You can have at him. And can I still move and do other things?
Matt: You can in a moment. We have to figure out if the other guy makes his save. He rolls a natural one.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: Aw, man, the rest of these people are going to be real pissed.
Liam: This is where my held turn comes in.
Laura: Me too, but I was in front of you.
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: If you hit him, does he become not paralyzed?
Liam: No, he's stuck.
Matt: Yes. At the end of each of his turns, the target can make another wisdom saving throw. And paralyzed, for those who are aware what paralyzation does, a paralyzed creature is incapacitated and cannot speak, automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws, attacks rolls have advantage, and any attack that hits the target is a critical hit if it's within five feet of the creature.
Laura: Oh, five feet. Damn it. Oh, but that's good for Grog. Okay.
Sam: Okay, wait. I still get my move, right?
Matt: You do.
Sam: Okay. Is there any cover? Are there chimneys? Is there anything I can duck behind?
Matt: You can duck behind the other side of this roof if you'd like.
Sam: And still maintain sight? Oh, wait, no, I'd be more than 60 feet away.
Matt: I mean, it's more the casting time. You can still move away once you've cast the spell and hold it there.
Sam: Okay. Then I'll duck back behind some cover. And as my bonus, I still get a bonus, I will inspire Grog and I'll say, Grog! Now it's your turn to fuck shit up. (laughter)
Sam: All right.
Matt: And that finishes your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: He's paralyzed.
Matt: You watch as he steps away from you, points up, and all the archers turn towards that, everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you hear a cacophony of voices around growling, before Kevdak takes another step and (grunts). And you see the gleaming ass of Scanlan in the distance, the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale, sun-dappled, gnomish skin. These two round globes of victory staring down from the rooftop.
Sam: Round globes of victory! I love it.
Travis: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak?
Matt: Do you want to pick up your weapon first, or?
Travis: No.
Matt: Nope? Okay.
Liam: Do the twins go first or does Grog go first?
Matt: Oh right, because you held your actions, so, up to you.
Sam: Okay, do your thing, do your thing.
Liam: I'm going to go.
Laura: I'm going to go.
Matt: Yep. All right. So. We have now Vex, taking your shots.
Laura: Yes. Yes. I'm going to shoot from my Longbow of the Sky Sentinel. So that's three attacks on the first attack.
Matt: Yes, and they all have advantage because he's paralyzed. This is bad for Kevdak, but we'll see how it works.
Laura: Okay, so.
Matt: Still raging, so everything's half-damage.
Laura: So 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first attack.
Matt: Yeah, that does.
Laura: Okay. 19 plus 12 hits on the second.
Matt: Yep.
Laura: And 17 plus 12 hits on the third?
Matt: Yeah, they all hit.
Laura: Okay. I'm adjusting my glasses, I'm so nervous. Okay. 28 on the first hit.
Matt: 28, reduced to 14, okay.
Laura: 21 on the second hit.
Ashley: Get him, baby.
Laura: 16 on the third hit.
Matt: Okay, that reduces to eight. All the arrows strike true, thump-thump-thump, but still each one is only piercing the flesh so far, he's generally so dense in his musculature, each impact is not having the same satisfying (impact) sound you're used to. But that ends your held action and it is now your turn.
Laura: Oh, but I get another attack, because that's just one attack.
Matt: Oh right, that was the sky sentinel, go for it. Take a second attack.
Laura: My second attack, I'm going to take at Greenbeard, and I'm going to shoot through the flaming bowstring.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 17 plus 12 probably hits? 17 plus 12?
Matt: Yeah, that's going to hit.
Laura: Okay. Gah! 14 on that one.
Matt: 14, okay. 14 damage to him. Greenbeard is currently stuck there in place, the arrow sinks into his robe and you don't even see the impact, it absorbs into the cloth and he goes, ah, and you hear the escaping air from the impact but he can't actually move.
Taliesin: Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I hunter's marked, he's hunter's marked already.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: At this point, you'd better.
Taliesin: We're not panicking, no, not at all.
Laura: Not at all. Hunter's Mark! I did it, I swear!
Matt: All right. You're up.
Liam: Just to verify, because Kevdak is still raging, am I denied the surprise attack from inside here?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay. So I'm going to use sharpshooter and drop five to hit harder, I'm going to throw a dagger at advantage, yeah?
Matt: So you're moving up into the doorway.
Liam: Yeah, to the doorway, right, so the first--
Matt: Who are you attacking?
Liam: Kevdak. 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet, you'd, okay, yeah, you can get right into there and probably still hit him from there. Because you have sharpshooter, you don't have the second increment range, go for it.
Liam: Okay, so it's 25.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Four, oh, hold on, I'll save that four. 20. Okay.
Travis: My hands are fucking shaking.
Liam: (counting) 31, 37.
Matt: 37. And half of that is going to put it at 18.
Liam: Okay. I'd like to use my bonus action to throw the next--
Matt: You had the held-- a held action is just your action.
Laura: Oh, yeah, you did the clicking the boots of haste already.
Liam: I thought that was a gimme-- oh, that's the bonus action?
Matt: Well, the idea being that when you hold your action, you have an action that you hold until it triggers. The bonus action's a whole different thing that you have to take on your turn.
Liam: So taking a hold is an action? I don't understand.
Sam: Holding your turn loses your bonus action.
Matt: Yes, essentially you have your action and your bonus action. Holding your action means you hold that one bit of it but your turn still continues past it.
Liam: Okay. Which doorway, where am I on the map, I can't see myself? Right there? Could I run to the corner of the building that the archers are on and scrabble up the side of it?
Matt: Over here?
Liam: And get to that archer?
Matt: You can certain try it. (laughter)
Matt: You rush past one of the peasants, fear in their face, they're confused and looking around and you see there's mud and a little trickle of blood that's dried down their face. As you (darting noise) by, they go, (gasps) You don't pay too much mind to them.
Liam: Acrobatics check?
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30. You manage to make it up to the top.
Liam: Do I have an action left?
Matt: No, you used your action.
Liam: Action, action, bonus action with the hasted boots?
Matt: Technically, you wouldn't be able to move at this point even, but I'm letting you do that. Usually your move, it's a little weird.
Liam: Okay, so I'm outta gas.
Matt: So yeah.
Travis: This is the most epic map ever, by the way.
Matt: Trinket's just chilling in the house. (sad bear noise) All righty. So that ends your held action, now Grog, you're up.
Travis: Can I walk around to the front of Kevdak, please?
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Knowing that he pointed up with a hand at Scanlan's beautiful ass, hand still on his greataxe, paralyzed, can I try and rip-- continuing my rage because he hit me last round-- can I pull the axe from his hand?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Liam: He's going to fail this one.
Matt: With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: 27.
Matt: Oof! You yank the bloodaxe from his grip.
Sam: Yes!
Travis: Because I'm frenzied raging, do I have another move?
Matt: I mean--
Travis: Like, can I hit him with it?
Matt: Let's check on that, because I don't know if it's an attack-action-based, because you didn't take an attack action last turn, you used your action to pull it away. Looking at that right now, the berserker is here. Let me see.
Sam: Lots of rules tonight, guys. Upper-level rules.
Matt: Yeah, it's a bonus action, so you could if you wanted to. The weapon isn't attuned to you, so it would just act as a regular axe, possibly.
Ashley: Make it attuned to you!
Marisha: That's a short rest.
Travis: Can I, looking at the axe, say, oh, I do hope you have a necromancer in your group, because I'm looking at a fucking dead man. (laughter)
Travis: Can I aim right above the gauntlet below the elbow on his left arm? Swing to his side with the axe.
Matt: Like on his left arm? Sure. You're going to be-- it's going to-- okay, so you're raging. Advantage. Well no, reckless attack would be the advantage if you wanted to.
Travis: Well, he did it against me so I get it against him.
Matt: Well, you have advantage against attacks with him anyway, because he's paralyzed. I will say, it'll have-- okay, you'll have advantage on the attack, but I will say it's a general minus five to the attack, just because it's a very specific called shot. Go for it.
Marisha: Do it, do it.
Travis: Oh, that's much better. 20.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I don't know what the attack bonus is with the axe.
Matt: It's a d12, and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Okay. Where is it? Jesus.
Laura: That's it, that's it, that top one. That one. Yeah.
Matt: Poor d12.
Travis: This one? Plus what?
Matt: Strength modifier, which would be three.
Travis: Ah. So five.
Matt: Five. Whoosh, you hack the blade and it sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the elbow, you can see as you pull it out, a bit of bone is exposed from it, but the arm is still intact. It wasn't enough damage to go through, but he's like, (stifled yell)
Travis: And it hit him, right? So is it an automatic critical because it hit?
Matt: Because you were within five feet, so, yes. So double the dice. So what'd you roll on the dice?
Travis: So it was a two.
Matt: So four. So instead it would be seven damage. Still not enough. But you do do a significant amount of damage to his left arm. His now-open hand's gripping nothing. Actually the one hand was holding the axe and the other one was pointing up, so he's like, (strained sound) looking at you right now as the blood begins to seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm.
Travis: Do I have any of my movement left, can I move around behind him? 50.
Matt: You can move three more spaces, so yeah.
Travis: I'll either flank him or, yeah.
Matt: Three. That's where you can get, right there. Okay. That ends your turn. Surprise back, Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: This'll be fun, we'll see what happens. All right, first thing I'm going to do is cast Hex on Kevdak, on the asshole, I'm going to Hex him.
Matt: (laughs) Cast Hex on the asshole.
Taliesin: So he is now enveloped in my dark smoke of death. He's also now at disadvantage on all strength checks.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: That's a thing.
Matt: That's the thing with Hex, all right. So yeah. You watch as Grog walks around him, Grog's shadow seems to stretch out from his form, reach up, and wrap itself around, almost merging with the tattoos across his torso. The actual bear tattoo almost seems to be almost covered with shadow.
Travis: I love you.
Taliesin: I know, I'm so happy. I'm going to take a little step back to get a slight bit of cover from those archers for when they start hearing the big bang-bangs coming from the house, to get half-cover, so I can still--
Matt: Which way are you going?
Taliesin: I'm going from my current vantage point, to about seven o'clock, eight o'clock.
Matt: About here?
Taliesin: Yeah, about there. For a little bit of cover from the arrows. And I can still see Kevdak.
Matt: Yes, you can.
Taliesin: So if I wanted to take my little pistol and start carving a little-- and I've got a nice little chunk of bone I can see in his arm-- can I take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point?
Matt: You could. I'll move this board a little bit so you guys can see better.
Taliesin: So I'm going to shoot with sharpshooter specifically for his arm.
Matt: His left arm, you do not have a view on it right away.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: I would say from your perspective on the rooftop, because he was turned this way and is facing this way, you would have a big ol' view of his back and shoulders.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to take a shot for the elbow.
Matt: On this arm?
Taliesin: I'm going to try, yeah, on the visible elbow.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to sharpshooter through that shit, see what happens.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Okay. And I'm happy if you want to put any weird disadvantage--
Matt: You have advantage on the attack because he's paralyzed.
Taliesin: No, I don't, because I'm at distance. Or do I have advantage be--
Marisha: He's paralyzed.
Taliesin: Oh, he's paralyzed! I have advantage on the attack.
Matt: You have advantage on that, and then you have disadvantage because it's a called shot, plus minus five.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fine. But I get the bonus ten points still.
Matt: You would if you hit.
Taliesin: Okay. All right. That's fine. Natural 20.
All: Oh!
Travis: Oh my god, are you serious?
Marisha: Yeah, yeah.
Taliesin: Should've used the big gun, really. All right, that's okay. So that's, oh, hello baby, you're over here. Actually, I'm going to use the pink one--
Matt: What's the first range increment for the pistol?
Taliesin: 400 feet.
Matt: Yeah, okay.
Taliesin: I'm scary.
Matt: Gun. Go for it.
Taliesin: I know. Sorry. I know, I thought about that. Come on, baby, no whammies. Do I double the dice?
Matt: Double the dice and then add the modifier to it.
Taliesin: Okay, so that's 16, (counting), 32 points of damage for the first shot.
Matt: 32 points of damage? Okay, half of that into 16. (gunshot) You watch as the blast hits into the side of his arm. The arm actually hyperextends and part of the bone shoots out the side, and he goes and screams out. The arm does not, you know, it looks like it's in a rough place.
Taliesin: I'm shooting again. Same thing.
Laura: Oh my god, he's going to shoot his arm off.
Taliesin: 17, good enough. 17, I'm rolling good.
Matt: With the disadvantage?
Taliesin: No, it cancels out because he's-- it's no advantage, no disadvantage, right?
Matt: You got advantage because he's paralyzed, yeah. You're right, you're right. Hold Person, man. Nasty.
Taliesin: (counting) 25 to hit. That hits.
Sam: This is like 127 Hours, except with a gun.
Taliesin: That's the title of my, '127 Hours With a Gun'.
Liam: And remember, this is happening in about ten seconds.
Taliesin: I know. I actually, also, I rolled the wrong die, he didn't take nearly what, that's okay, so here.
Matt: Too late.
Taliesin: I know, too late. I know. I fucked that up.
Marisha: You rolled four, though.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know, so I did okay. Five, six, seven, eight-- (counting) 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage. So minus that to 12, this is the same elbow?
Taliesin: Same elbow.
Matt: (gunshot) You see now, the arm actually is dangling now from some sort of sinew and bone that is barely keeping it on at this point.
Taliesin: Do you have a d6 that I can borrow? I'm going to go for my third, can I borrow your pink d6? I want to Bowie this shit. Yeah. I want to be flamboyant as fuck. All right. Going to call it. 14. (counting) 24 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: Goodbye, elbow. Eh, well, not bad. (counting) 23 points of damage.
Matt: Lower that to 11. Okay. This shot hits the elbow again, actually destroying a big portion of the upper forearm. It's now essentially but a single leftover bicep muscle that's holding it in place as blood's pouring from the wound right now.
Liam: Who wants bacon?
Taliesin: All right. I'm calling it for now.
Matt: All right, that ends Percy's turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to roll up this roof like a big, ominous fog cloud. And come up, and I want to do a Whirlwind on those two archers up there.
Matt: Up here? Are you coming from up here, you mean?
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: All righty. Let's take this here.
Marisha: So they must make a DC 13 strength saving throw.
Taliesin: I haven't burned any grit yet, I'm so excited.
Matt: Balancing here, there we go. A DC what? Oh no! Keyleth's dead.
Laura: No!
Ashley: No!
Taliesin: Ironically, crushed by a tree. Curse you, nature.
Matt: All right, what's the DC on that?
Marisha: The thing that she loved killed her. 13. Strength.
Matt: Strength?
Taliesin: Strength check or save?
Matt: This is a saving throw.
Taliesin: Oh, damn. Does he still have disadvantage?
Sam: Except she's not attacking him.
Matt: Okay, one of them fails, one of them succeeds.
Marisha: Okay, so the one that fails takes 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage, which is pretty good. 11, and he's flung 20 feet away. In a random direction.
Matt: In a random direction? All right. Let's go ahead and see what direction, that's a one, so he gets flung this way 20 feet?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20. (yells, impact). Falls prone there.
Marisha: He takes another 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every ten feet he was thrown.
Matt: Yes, that would be-- 2d6, that puts it at, I rolled double sixes on that, so that's 12 points of damage.
Travis: Yeah yeah!
Marisha: And he's knocked prone.
Matt: Yes he is.
Marisha: And the other guy--
Matt: (yells, impact), as this whirlwind of--
Laura: Ow ow ow ow.
Ashley: Ow ow ow ow.
Matt: Yeah, as you see, of the roof itself up there, portions of the rooftop are cracking off and spinning into the void of wind that Keyleth's currently creating within herself. Portions of the tree branches are swirling into it as various leaves and dead plant life that had been scattered around the roof are all filling this giant vortex that has appeared on the roof of the Margrave's house, tearing into both of the archers. One of them flung off, landing face-first, the other one--
Marisha: Takes half damage.
Matt: Takes half damage. Okay. All right. Five points of bludgeoning damage. All right. Does that finish your turn?
Marisha: Yup.
Matt: All right. Pike, you're up.
Sam: Yeah, Pike!
Ashley: Since I can't reach Kevdak, I'm going to send over a Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: Range is 60 feet.
Matt: Spiritual Weapon. As a cleric. That's a level... two?
Ashley: I'm going to do it at a higher level, I'm going to do it at a level five.
Taliesin: Five? Five?
Ashley: It's a big one. (laughter)
Liam: In the shape of Madeline Kahn and it's out for blood.
Matt: We'll use this metal d20, where do you want to place it?
Ashley: Right above him.
Matt: We'll say in this central area there.
Ashley: It's, I don't even know, a big--
Matt: What weapon of Sarenrae's retribution would you want to summon in spiritual form upon Kevdak?
Sam: A beartrap!
Ashley: I just want it to be a big sword.
Matt: Okay, so a large greathand sword, almost a light reflection mirror-image of the Craven Edge that nearly tore the soul from your friend--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: You see a large light blade of Sarenrae's wrath emerges out of the stonework in the center of the square. Floats in the air for a second, and you want to go ahead and make that, and this is your bonus action--
Ashley: This is a bonus action, yeah.
Matt: If you want to use your action to cast a spell, you can't do higher than a level two right now. Because of the limitations on spells in our homebrew. However, do you want to have it attack Kevdak?
Ashley: Yeah!
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll for the damage. With advantage.
Ashley: That would be a natural 20.
Laura: C'mon, Pike!
Ashley: All right, okay.
Marisha: We talked for a week!
Taliesin: Hundreds of text messages.
Matt: Wait 'til the surprise round's over.
Liam: You mean 30 seconds with the earring.
Matt: All right, so, you're looking at 4d8.
Ashley: Okay, I'm going to use Divine Strike to make it 5d8.
Matt: Well, that's only on your melee attack, it's not your actual spells.
Liam: It's all right, you're already a badass.
Matt: So roll 4d8, multiply that by two.
Sam: Multiply by two.
Matt: Critical hit.
Sam: Oh my god.
Ashley: What did you say?
Matt: You roll 4d8 times two.
Ashley: 22.
Matt: So 22 plus your wisdom modifier.
Ashley: Is 30.
Matt: So 30. Half that to 15.
Ashley: Aw.
Sam: Hey, that's good!
Matt: As the blade strikes down onto the now currently brutalized Kevdak who is still held in place angrily being whaled upon by the majority of you. So what else do you want to do this turn, if anything?
Laura: Oh yeah, you can still do other things!
Matt: You can move, you have an action.
Laura: This is a bonus!
Matt: It lasts for a minute, and it's not concentration.
Ashley: Yeah, I should probably, I should probably--
Matt: As a bonus action you can make it move and attack every round, so.
Ashley: Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to, would it be possible to get down on that bottom roof and hide?
Matt: Here?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: You could. Make an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Clang clang clang.
Laura: You're going to roll, roll for it! I can't even read that. Oh.
Matt: What's the total?
Ashley: Five.
Matt: Fresh off the 20. Pike looks over the edge, leaps, hits a little bit to the side, her feet actually break-- from the weight of the armor and the angle you hit, break some of the shingles on the rooftop and you end up slipping onto your shield and you slide off the roof.
Laura: No!
Matt: And end up on the ground there.
Matt: You take seven points of damage from the fall, and you're knocked prone currently on the ground as you now see staring at you-- You're prone. A number of these angry Herd members that are all intent on murder at what's been happening.
Liam: I still think you're really cool.
Ashley: It's okay, I can run out of there with my Sprinter's Boots.
Matt: All right, Pike, that ends your turn. Now. I get to do some more stuff.
Taliesin: She's made of armor.
Sam: They're coming for you, Pike. You got a reaction or something?
Laura: Seriously. Pike, they're all coming for you.
Sam: Yeah. You're dead. Do you have a reaction of some sort? Do you have a reaction?
Marisha: Don't die, you are not dying tonight.
Ashley: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, we're going to be fine, we're going to be fine.
Taliesin: She's made of armor and they're people with sticks, with sharp sticks.
Sam: Oh my god, she's going to die.
Marisha: She's not going to die, she's not going to die.
Sam: Love of my life.
Taliesin: Not in one round.
Marisha: There's only one guy who ran up to her.
Laura: Scanlan, would it say 'reaction' here?
Sam: She knows what her reactions are. You do have one.
Matt: All right, so. Three of these individuals, some of which you may have passed in your time, and two of which you see are members that were absorbed into the tribe from what was previously the Rivermaw tribe, (roar) give off these angry roars and go into an immediate rage, breaking the surprise element, and charge. Three of them on you, one of them goes darting across the field right towards you, Pike. With that, these, pull out this sheet here, these Herd of the Storm warmongers are going to go apeshit on your ass. Grog, that's six attacks on you. Because of the flanking rules, that's going to put four of them at advantage.
Sam: Oh my god.
Matt: First one is going to be an 18 to hit?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Misses. The first one goes and swings towards you, and you duck underneath it and whoomph, misses you by a mile. However, as that's happening, another blade comes the other direction, that's going to be a 25?
Travis: That hits.
Matt: Natural 20. Third one, so one hit. Second one's going to be a 28, so that's two hits and a critical. And then one that doesn't have advantage on you with both strikes is going to be 23, that hits, and a 16 that misses. So.
Sam: You do have inspiration.
Matt: Four hits and one crit.
Travis: I can't use it on this stuff, though. Only when I attack.
Matt: All righty. So, the four hits first. That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage.
Travis: Reduced to seven?
Matt: Reduced to seven. Right. Ooh, 19 points of slashing damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: 13 points of slashing damage, reduced to six. And another 13, reduced to six. Now for the crit.
Taliesin: I would like to remind you that potions are a bonus action. Thank you.
Matt: (counting) That's going to be 22 points of slashing damage on that, reduced to 11.
Taliesin: Whew, you are a tank.
Laura: Unless he's unconscious.
Matt: Pike. So you're now surrounded on all sides, Kevdak's there before you, but you've now been completely swarmed in by three of these entities. Pike, this one rushes towards you, (battle-cry), this female half-elf, you can see a line of drool from her face with the sheer speed she was running and the froth that was forming at the corner of it. She leaps into the air, blade in front, and is going to come down on your tiny form. (counting) That's 28 to hit on the first one.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: And a 28. Rolled 18s on both advantage ones.
Ashley: Okay okay okay okay.
Matt: Right, so two hits on you, you take 19 points of slashing damage from the first strike.
Ashley: That's not halved? No, it's only halved because he's--
Matt: Only because he's raging.
Ashley: I'm a barbarian, too! (laughter)
Matt: 19 on the first strike, the second one is 13, so that's a total of 32 points of slashing damage to you. And that's going to end the barbarians' turn, everyone else finishes out surprise round, now we're back into full initiative, everyone's in play, top of the round, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. If I aim an arrow, it's at disadvantage?
Matt: If you aimed specifically for something? It would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to cast, I'm going to cast--
Matt: I mean, he's paralyzed, so it would have advantage, so it would cancel out, it would be just a regular attack at minus five.
Laura: Okay, here's my question.
Matt: Yes?
Laura: The siege arrow that Percy gave me, is that a magical weapon or a technical weapon?
Matt: It's a technical weapon, it's used essentially against structures, objects.
Laura: So just structures.
Matt: It's an explosive in an arrow that is used primarily to destroy structures, yeah.
Laura: So it wouldn't harm people?
Matt: I mean, it would hurt people like a regular arrow, and it might do a little bit extra, but--
Laura: Not anything crazy?
Matt: Not that you know of, you don't have a full understanding of what the arrow's capable of. You did not create it.
Taliesin: I gave you the big debrief with the arrow, I gave you the how-to--
Laura: I know I know I know I know.
Matt: What're you doing? Hurry.
Laura: Okay okay okay! Okay!
Matt: Vax, you're on deck.
Laura: I'm going to cast Hail of Thorns at third level into a group, the group. At Kevdak.
Travis: No. Whatever you're going to do. Just do it.
Laura: Just do it? I'm going to do it at Kevdak and anything that is close to him gets hit. Anything--
Matt: Within five feet of him? And you're doing it at what level?
Laura: At level three.
Matt: Level three, so that's 3d10 points of piercing damage. All righty. Okay. So go ahead and make an attack against Kevdak, that is going to be-- Yeah, with advantage because it's not an aimed shot, so go ahead and take it.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: Are you serious?
Taliesin: You've been doing it all night, too. I figure, you know, it's only fair.
Matt: I've gotten like one.
Taliesin: No, you've had more than one. We've been counting.
Matt: I've had two?
Liam: Two for Kevdak's initiative and two for here.
Matt: That's true, that's true, I actually, could've been worse. All right, so. Go ahead and roll against Kevdak, that is going to be six, or 3d10 times two.
Laura: Oh, 3d10? Oh.
Sam: Yeah, oh.
Laura: 20, plus an additional-- oh no, Hunter's Mark dropped because it's a concentration. But I am sneaking-attacking. An additional six. Oh, that's 12 then, because it doubles the dice.
Matt: Correct, yeah.
Laura: So that's 32 points of damage.
Matt: 32 on him, reduce that to 16 piercing. All righty. And then all the rest of them have to make dexterity saving throws against your spell DC. What's your spell DC? This includes Grog.
Laura: 15.
Sam: C'mon, Groggy.
Travis: What, what was it?
Laura: 15.
Travis: What 15?
Sam: You got to make a save to get outta the way. With inspiration.
Laura: With inspiration.
Travis: 17.
Matt: All right, so half damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Which is halved again, one quarter, because there's a whole bunch of raging individuals.
Travis: 32, halved is 16, which is eight.
Matt: Two of them succeed as well and also take eight damage.
Laura: They're barbarians as well?
Sam: They're raging? They're raging.
Matt: And then one of them takes full damage at 16. All righty. So. That concludes your action. You want to move, or you going to stay where you are?
Laura: If I fly on my broom, can I go down and grab Pike? As an action? I mean, as a movement?
Matt: It's going to be hard-pressed for you this turn to pull out your broom. I mean, you've been clutching your broom with you this whole time, you leaned it up against the wall as you hid down there?
Laura: Okay. I'm going to stay where I am. And I'm going to hide against the window so nobody can see me.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Against on-- yeah, like that.
Matt: That brings us to the next in the initiative order, Vax.
Liam: All right, I want to preface this with, last week I misspoke, I thought I had one Luck left as I used it, but I got it backwards, so I have one Luck left this week in case I want to use it.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Go back and look at the videotape.
Liam: You can. Well no, I said the wrong thing. But anyway, I want to use my first action to shove that archer backward off the roof.
Matt: Shove them?
Liam: Yeah, shove them off.
Matt: All right, let's go ahead and do a shove action. Find myself on this one here-- all right, so, for shove-- I need you to go ahead and--
Liam: Strength?
Matt: --make an athletics check.
Liam: Athletics check.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to trigger the Luck right now.
Matt: All right.
Liam: That helped it, yeah. That gets it to 20.
Matt: To 20? That's going to be a 12.
Laura: Yay!
Marisha: Yay!
Matt: So you shove it five feet. This way? All right, so it's going to go ahead and make an acrobatics--
Liam: Ah, no, towards you, Matt, was my intention, yeah.
Matt: Towards me? All right, this way. Shove, they do make an acrobatics check but they do land off the side here. So they take eight points of damage being pushed off the side. All righty.
Sam: This board is incredible.
Matt: So that person's now fallen out of sight (yells), off the side.
Liam: Now, question  am I able to use my bonus action to hide behind that chimney from Kevdak's view, and the archers are, am I able to do that? Just with Kevdak?
Matt: Yeah, the chimney should offer you enough, and you have a tree between the two of you anyway.
Liam: Okay. So I hide behind the chimney.
Matt: Make a dexterity, make a stealth check.
Liam: Stealth check. That's 25.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I would like to use my last action to throw at Kevdak, so I should still have advantage, because he's held, and I should have, if I'm hiding, it's a sneak attack, isn't it?
Matt: Well, sneak attack is if it's an attack with advantage anyway.
Liam: Oh, my friend's still next to him. Oh, then, then, excuse me, I would like to throw two daggers.
Matt: Well, the shove was your action.
Liam: Right, and I did the boots, so I have action-action-bonus action.
Matt: Okay, hold on. Let me see if it's-- You don't have two actions, you have two attacks. Let me check and see if it is. There is a distinction there.
Liam: Every millimeter counts tonight.
Matt: Yeah, this attack replaces one of them, if you have multiple attacks, with the attack action, which you don't. So you have your offhand bonus and the haste one, so you do have--
Liam: Two attacks right now. Okay. So first one is an 18 to hit Kevdak, second one is a 25 to hit Kevdak.
Matt: Both hit.
Liam: Both hit. Okay. So the first one, (counting).
Marisha: That rogue damage. That rogue damage!
Liam: I'm missing a big pile of dice! Eight, 12, 13, 19, 22, 28, 30, 36.
Matt: 36, half that to-- I know, that brings it to 36, 18.
Liam: Is it? It's not a crit, right?
Matt: No, but it's half-damage for him.
Liam: Right, I have to be right up against him to get a crit, and the second dagger does eight halved to four.
Matt: Okay, four damage, gotcha. Total 22 points of damage on him. As he's taking all these hits. All right.
Liam: And I have a little bit of movement, right?
Matt: You do have a little bit of movement, because you--
Liam: I'll go fwoosh, right up against the flat side, right below Keyleth, pressed against the wall there.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Looking up her windskirts?
Liam: No. Not that.
Marisha: I've got a Marilyn Monroe thing going on in my air elemental, oh.
Matt: There we go. So you're now hidden up against that roof right below there, and your stealth check was 25 earlier, so we'll go with that.
Liam: All right, maybe, maybe a quick look. Maybe a quick look.
Matt: Move the board a little bit for the people that are watching so they can get a better view here. There we go. So you're over here. Right here, Liam. All right. So! That brings us to--
Liam: Oh, shit! Never mind.
Sam: Six more attacks!
Matt: No, you're done, your turn's over.
Liam: Never mind, I didn't say it, I didn't say it so it doesn't matter.
Matt: Yeah. All right, so. This archer here is going to turn, looking over at the-- let's see. He's currently handled, he's okay right there. This archer saw you firing. Over in that hide, he's going to turn to you.
Taliesin: I'm looking at him right now, actually, I've got my gun in my left hand and I'm looking at him.
Matt: Archer's going to take two shots, pulling on his longbow, (arrow sounds). Two arrows at you, Percy.
Taliesin: I smile the whole time. Bring it.
Liam: Staring at him with that dead-in-the-eyes Percy look? Yeah.
Taliesin: Do not fuck with Reed Richards. He will fuck you up.
Matt: That is a 20 to hit on the first one.
Taliesin: That hits.
Matt: And a 25 on the second.
Taliesin: That, that also hits.
Sam: Everybody's rolling high tonight. Except us.
Matt: First one is 11 points of piercing damage to you.
Taliesin: 11 for the first one?
Matt: Yep.
Taliesin: I take it in the shoulder.
Matt: All right. The second one is going to go ahead and do 13 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: That one I'm going to catch.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll for it.
Sam: Gloves of Missile Snaring!
Taliesin: That's 14, so not only does it do no damage, I actually take it and catch.
Matt: You catch the arrow in front of your face.
Taliesin: Snap it.
Matt: (laughs) That's amazing.
Taliesin: And the gun is going to turn to look at him.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Nice, Percy.
Matt: You can see from the distance the visage of this half-orc looks back as you do that and goes-- And goes to shakily-- hand reaching back for another arrow. This archer's going to go ahead and leap down onto here. Oh, you do get an attack of opportunity on him.
Laura: He knocks down a tree in the process.
Marisha: What a dick! That's a natural 18, so that's a 26.
Matt: Pretty sure that hits. Also rolled a natural 19 on the acrobatics check, so lands fine, but you do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him as he jumps down.
Liam: Airsoft shot to the nuts.
Marisha: I rolled double ones.
Laura: Pathetic!
Marisha: Plus five, so seven.
Laura: That's not bad, that's not bad.
Marisha: Little damage.
Liam: Something to remember you by.
Ashley: Maybe he only has like ten hit points.
Matt: Cool, so your elemental form swings wide, manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap down, sending them into a spin, but they do manage to catch themself because they're quite acrobatic. In doing so, they step up to the very edge here to their friend, who is currently on the ground, who is also going to get up there, and they're both going to look at each other, pull their arrows out, and they're going to go ahead and make a series of strikes. Let's see. This one here is going to go ahead and is going to shoot at Pike, because Pike's on the ground. And this one's going to go ahead and strike at Grog, because it can't see Percy over there through the tree. So Grog--
Laura: Natural one, natural one.
Matt: That is a 19.
Travis: Misses.
Matt: Misses you? (arrow sound) One arrow hits the bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters off the bone. The second one, however, is a 26.
Travis: Yes, that hits.
Matt: All right, so. From that one, you take, I don't like that, cocked. Nine points of piercing damage. Reduced to four. The one that's taking two strikes at you, Pike, because you're on the ground, now.
Ashley: It's also probably very hard for him to shoot through the people that are attacking me.
Matt: There is one individual attacking you that is on the other side of your body, so you're pretty visible from that point in time.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: She's really little.
Matt: However, the attack, because you are prone, it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you because it's not within five feet of you. But it's going to go ahead and attempt to make it. Two 17s in a row. Plus ten, that's-- sorry, not plus ten, plus eight on the archers, yeah, plus eight. So that's 25?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: And natural one on the other disadvantage, so that misses. You take 13 points of piercing damage from one of the arrows, (arrow sound). So it's going to do there. They finish their turns. This one is going to, being pushed, shoved off, come around here.
Marisha: What? Who's that?
Laura: Oh, that's the one you pushed off the roof.
Matt: Is going to come over this way and hide to the side. Just going to watch what's happening. That finishes the archers' turn. Kevdak. (grunts) Unable to do anything, is going to attempt to make a saving throw. And that is going to be a total of 18. What's your DC?
Sam: 20. (yelling)
Travis: Oh, Scanlan! I will make out with that fucking shirt, I swear to god!
Sam: I mean, my spell DC's 18, but with the Hand Cone of Clarity, okay.
Taliesin: Don't talk him out of it.
Sam: Just making sure.
Matt: Oh man. All right, well, that ends Kevdak's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Okay. I, while maintaining concentration I can still use the wand to do things, yeah? So I'll use three charges of the Wand of Fireballs.
Matt: What're you doing now?
Sam: I'm aiming a Fireball right around there.
Matt: So moving up to here.
Sam: Oh yes, I guess I have to move forward to attack. Can I get a radius that includes Kevdak and these guys over here?
Matt: Yeah, you can do that.
Sam: But not Pike. And hopefully not Grog if my aim is true.
Matt: Yeah, if you get it there you can manage to hit all of them but Grog right there.
Sam: Okay.
Ashley: Go Scanlan!
Matt: One, two, three, four, five, six.
Sam: Okay. Three charges is 10d6.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll that. Kevdak automatically fails, because he's paralyzed.
Liam: Yeah. MVP.
Matt: So does Greenbeard.
Sam: 34.
Matt: All right, so. 34, reduced to half because he's raging. That brings it to six, no, 17. All right, and then Greenbeard takes 34. The other ones there, they do not get advantages because they're all just fighters, that's a failure, failure, what was the spell DC on the wand? Because it's different from yours.
Sam: DC's 15, I wrote it down. DC 15.
Matt: Okay, so that's a success. Success. So two of them over there take-- all right.
Taliesin: It'll be fine, it'll be fine, things are working.
Matt: All righty. Great, so (explosion). Giant burst of flame hits, it actually sets fire to this entire structure. The wooden barricade is in flames, we'll say for the purposes of considering that.
Sam: There's flaming spikes on the field!
Marisha: Flaming spikes!
Matt: All right, so. There we go. There is currently--
Taliesin: I was really hoping you were going to come up with a-- oh wow, that's actually-- never mind, I am not disappointed at all.
Matt: So those are on fire.
Marisha: Hah, 'I thought you were going to come out with a f-- that, that, yeah, that works, that.'
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: I'm going to try to do the Pike move and jump down one level.
Matt: Down there? All right, make an acrobatics check.
Sam: Oh, Jesus. Okay, okay. 14-- 19!
Matt: 19. You leap down and make it right there.
Sam: Okay. And I will, with the bonus, I will heal Grog with a Healing Word.
Matt: Healing Word, okay. What's the range on it?
Sam: Oh. 60 feet for Healing Word, I believe. Right?
Matt: He's just out of your range.
Sam: Okay, well then I will heal Pike, is that okay?
Matt: You can do that, you can shout over the side. You have to get into view of her, which means you have to move a little bit closer to the edge, but yeah.
Sam: Okay, I'll do that.
Matt: Okay, so you get about there, glance off the side. All right. Go for it.
Sam: I'll peek over the side and say, (singing) Never going to fuck you up, never going to let you down, never going to run around and not heal you. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll your heal for Pike. Grog, you're up next.
Sam: Yeah, seven points!
Ashley: Oh, I'll take it.
Matt: Hey, it all helps. All right. And with that, Grog, you're up.
Laura: Oh my god. (singing) Natural crit.
Travis: So in my frenzied reckless attacking, great weapon master, can I bring my axe up high and swing it for the first attack to his left side where dangly hand is?
Matt: You can, go for it. Your regular straight attack. You have advantage, and then it's disadvantage for that, so that brings it to a regular attack. Minus five.
Travis: Disadvantage for the?
Matt: Because of the called shot.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: But then advantage because it's reckless?
Travis: 23.
Matt: 23? Hits. With the minus five?
Travis: No. 18.
Matt: Still hits. (cheering)
Taliesin: You asshole.
Matt: So it's a d12.
Travis: (counting) 20 for the first one. 30, with great weapon master.
Laura: But you double your dice because it's a natural crit, because he's five feet away.
Matt: Because he's paralyzed and five feet away.
Travis: 60.
Laura: No, just your dice, double your dice.
Matt: This is with your axe, right? So with the axe, it's a d12 plus your raging bonus, plus your strength.
Travis: 11. Which is seven. Or eight. Rage bonus is eight.
Matt: Well, the rage bonus should be plus-- the total becomes plus--
Travis: Oh sorry, the total bonus is eight.
Matt: Three plus-- four, isn't it, right now? So it should be seven.
Travis: That's why that's a seven. That's it. Right.
Matt: Yeah. You're not using your warhammer. You're not attuned to this weapon.
Travis: Right, okay, so whatever.
Matt: So what'd you roll on the dice?
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. Technically it's a critical hit. So, I mean, it's a critical hit, so you do your brutal critical. You roll two more d12s. So it was an 11 times two, that's 22, plus seven, that's 29, plus 2d12.
Travis: Five, so that's 34.
Matt: 34.
Travis: And a nine, so that's 43.
Matt: 43 reduced to half, that's 21 points of slashing damage.
Travis: And that's the first one, called shot.
Matt: With that, thunk, the blade finds its way into his side, as you hear cracking on the rock below him, the sound of the left gauntlet, (cracking) hitting the bottom of the square. The fingers twitch in the gauntlet as he's currently standing there with his left arm bisected from the rest of his body.
Laura: Does he shrink?
Matt: No.
Laura: Dammit.
Travis: Second attack, straight across his back.
Matt: Okay, straight into his back?
Sam: Does another smaller doll hand come out to replace it?
Laura: Teeny tiny.
Travis: That is a 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Travis: Yeah, 22. Okay. And that's four, so double this-- 12, right? So four times two is eight. Plus four is 11. Math is a bitch. And two more of them? Because it's a critical? Okay. Seven. And a nine.
Matt: 28, half that is 14.
Laura: Math! Math is fun!
Matt: So you're hacking into him, you see the wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the amount of pain that's wracking him at this time. He's still holding up against a lot of damage that's come to him, but he's starting to look a little rough.
Travis: So I have my third frenzied attack for a bonus action, right? With my bonus action I have one superior healing potion. Can I take that?
Matt: You can, yeah. That will heal you, a superior, let's see. Superior is 8d4 plus eight.
Travis: 8d4 plus eight?
Matt: Your superior, that's the expensive one you guys got.
Liam: 8d4, four-sided, the four-sided. Pyramids.
Travis: Fuck me, asshole. Fuck. Fuck me asshole! Seven. Nine. Ele-- 12. 14. 16. 19. 20. 20.
Matt: All right, so you heal 20. All right, that ends your turn, Grog. All righty. Unless you want to move.
Travis: Can I, can I-- huh?
Laura: You could pick it up.
Travis: I can't pick it up, I can only move.
Matt: I mean, you have, you wouldn't be able to wield your axe.
Laura: But can you put it in the Bag of Holding?
Matt: Next turn, if you want to try it.
Travis: No, I'm going to, can I move, if I stay in his flank, if I move away from the three guys that are surrounding me, they're--
Matt: They're all going to get an attack on you.
Travis: I'll stay.
Matt: All right. All right, so that finishes your turn, Grog.
Travis: Yes, thank you.
Matt: Next up is Greenbeard, who is currently frozen in place, however, rolls an 18 plus five, as far as, his wisdom is plus ten, so that puts him at 28. So he resists the Hold Person and is currently no longer affected by that. All right, that finishes his turn, though, because that's the end of his turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: All right. This is going to be fun. That asshole who just shot me, I'm now aiming at him. And I'm going to push him off the roof, this'll be fun. So, pushing him off the roof, am I going to do extra damage to him, or am I?
Liam: If he hits. If he hits the ground.
Taliesin: Well, I mean, I'm debating whether or not to sharpshooter it to do-- no, I think I'll just push him off the roof. It's funnier.
Travis: I can feel my heartbeat in my face.
Laura: I know, I can't tell if it's actually really warm in here or if we're all just really hot.
Matt: Probably a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. What was it?
Taliesin: 28 to hit.
Matt: 28 hits. Non-sharpshooter?
Taliesin: Non-sharpshooter.
Sam: Dullshooter.
Taliesin: But I'm doing a torso shot. So he gets no save, there's no save for the torso shot, he's going to take his damage and move ten feet away from me.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: So. That's 14 points of damage, of piercing damage.
Matt: 14 points of piercing damage and he gets shoved off the back of the roof, he's going to make an acrobatics check, which he succeeds, so he lands down there and he only takes one point of damage from the fall, but. There you go.
Taliesin: Fine. I'm going to reload, and now, what am I going to do? Let's see.
Sam: Jump down the chimney, deliver presents.
Taliesin: Surveying the field, trying to make some decisions.
Sam: Help Pike!
Taliesin: I can't. Well!
Marisha: Can you hit Greenbeard?
Taliesin: I can hit Greenbeard, I'm going to hit Greenbeard. He's got the magicky creepy thing, right?
Laura: Yeah, he's gross. He's got mold on his neck.
Matt: Fungal moss on his whole neck and chest area.
Taliesin: All right. Well, we'll see how things go. Let's do a sharpshooter shot at him right now. Let's see what a little bit of damage does to him. So sharpshooter with Retort. Don't miss. And my pistol goes (breaking sound). (groaning)
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: And I'm putting it away, so.
Matt: Okay, all right, so that's going to end your turn? Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. Tornado's coming down the house. I'm going to hit these two guys with a Whirlwind again.
Matt: Right here?
Marisha: Yep. 13 strength save.
Matt: 13 strength saves on both of them. Archers-- all right. That's a natural 19 plus two, and two natural 19s in a row. Yeah, they both make their saves.
Marisha: So nine plus-- oh, one more d8. Plus another five, so that was 12 plus five is 17, plus another two, so 19 halved.
Matt: 19 halved? All right, so that puts them at nine points of bludgeoning damage each. Not really having much of an effect at this point in the fight, however, as you swirl around, picking up the debris from the roof as you can, it slams into them and they brace against it, but they still, glancing over their shoulder, realize that they've got to continue what they're doing now. The bigger threat appears to be out in front of them.
Marisha: I'm staying in their space, by the way.
Matt: Right, right, so you're up in there. Up in their shit.
Laura: Up in their business? Oh, it fell anyway! It happened.
Matt: There you go. No. All righty. Finished your turn? All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right. I'm going to put on my Sprinter's Boots.
Matt: They're on you, right?
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: So you're getting up, that's half your movement to stand up, all right.
Ashley: Yeah. Okay. And I'm going to run around towards the back of the house.
Matt: This way?
Sam: Door.
Matt: What're you doing? Ashley, what're you doing? So your Sprinter's Boots activate, which gives you double movement. Right? So you can move 50 feet. But you moved up, it took you 25 to stand up because it's half your speed to get up from prone, so you still have 25 feet you can move.
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to go around to the side.
Matt: This side? All right, so you move. Here? Right?
Ashley: Yeah, as far as it'll--
Matt: Okay, so you rush over there. That one guy takes a swing at you as you rush by, gah!, or girl I should say, the female half-elf swings with the giant blade. That's going to be a 23?
Ashley: Fuck. Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As the blade smacks you from behind as you rush past, you suffer 14 points of slashing damage. In your back. But you keep running around the edge. All right, what are you doing?
Ashley: All right, I'm going to heal myself.
Matt: All righty.
Ashley: A little, doing a little rough here. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself. At third level.
Sam: Isn't this exciting?
Liam: Yes it is!
Marisha: Good times, guys.
Sam: We're fighting a horde of goliaths!
Matt: What you got, Ashley?
Ashley: What's that?
Matt: What you got, what you doing?
Ashley: Oh, I cast Cure Wounds on myself.
Matt: And you're done? You're healed up? Okay, that's the end of your turn.
Ashley: I can't do any, don't I have a bonus action?
Matt: You have a bonus action still if you want.
Laura: You got your spiritual weapon still.
Ashley: Okay, I'm going to use my spiritual weapon on him again, on Kevdak.
Matt: Okay, so go ahead and swing for the attack on that one.
Ashley: Okay, and I'm going to use Guided Strike?
Matt: Well, I mean, yeah, you have advantage. You have advantage on the attack, by the way, he's paralyzed. He's still paralyzed.
Laura: Oh, that's good!
Ashley: It's still under it.
Laura: Don't you add anything to it?
Matt: Add your spell attack.
Ashley: Oh, yeah, well then I'm great. Fuck, I'm forgetting everything, I'm so nervous!
Matt: It's okay, you've been away for a while.
Ashley: Okay. Yeah, we're good to go. 22.
Matt: 22? That hits. So go ahead and roll your 3d8, I think it is, no, 4d8.
Laura: 4d8.
Matt: Plus your wisdom modifier, which is plus-- what's your wisdom modifier?
Sam: She's doing math, give her a second.
Taliesin: Dice are doubled, too? The weapon's within five feet.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Sam: (nerdy voice) Oh, the weapon's within five feet.
Laura: Do you add the spell attack bonus to it?
Taliesin: Suck it, nerd. Dear god.
Matt: No, it's not attack, it's your wisdom modifier, but what's the dice, the dice are doubled because it's a critical hit.
Travis: 18.
Laura: Times two.
Matt: 36, half that to 18. Then add your wisdom modifier.
Laura: Plus four!
Matt: Plus four. All right, so. Half of that would be two, so 20. 20 points of damage to him from the strike of that. All righty, that finishes your turn.
Travis: Does your piece of paper back there look like Stephen Hawking's chalkboard?
Matt: Kind of, right now, yeah.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: That's actually way more organized than I thought it would be.
Travis: Young Stephen Hawking. You horrible, horrible person.
Matt: First, the woman who just swung past you is going to go ahead and rush around the corner as well and follow you, since you got out of the way. Rush into and go after you, Pike. The three that are on you, Grog, are still going to, after watching you cut one of Kevdak's arms off, roar angrily around you, all three of them (roar), and go into another round of angry, angry strikes against you.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: All right, so that comes to you, Grog, since you did reckless attack on him for the stuff, they all have advantage on you anyway, so all the attacks are with advantage, that's six attacks.
Marisha: Six attacks.
Matt: That's a natural 20. (yelling)
Matt: 26 on the second. 23 on the third.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: 24 on the fourth.
Taliesin: Can you roll poorly?
Matt: 26 on the fifth.
Sam: Wow.
Liam: Welcome to our production of Julius Caesar.
Matt: No, they all, five hits and one crit.
Laura: What?
Matt: They all hit, yeah. Reckless attack puts you in a bad position when you're surrounded with guys that can do multiple hits that are also barbarians.
Liam: Here it comes.
Marisha: Get that barbarian's resistance.
Matt: We'll do the crit first on you.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: You already used the Stone's Resistance. Oh, the barbarian, yeah. So that'll help.
Travis: Don't say the word yet.
Marisha: Well.
Sam: Is it that thing where you die?
Matt: Seven plus eight, 15, reduced to half, that's seven. So I'll give you the direct amounts here. So this is with the reduction. So that's seven points of slashing damage. Another seven.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Another seven.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Here we go. That's a nine.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Not that great. That's a six.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And then now the crit.
Laura: I thought you said the first one was a crit.
Liam: That's what you said.
Matt: And then I thought differently but I didn't say it out loud, but because you're calling me on it, I'll let it happen.
All: No, no, no.
Liam: Are you saying what's in your head is different than what's in my head?
Matt: Okay. That was double sixes. So that's 22 plus eight is 30, so 15 points of slashing damage. On all those strikes against you. Pike? Two attacks on you.
Sam: You still alive there?
Matt: That's a natural 20. And that's 15.
Ashley: No.
Matt: No, so. That is a one and two, so that's three, six plus eight, you take 14 points of slashing damage from this barbarian female who's all up on your grill.
Ashley: I hate this bitch!
Matt: Ending that turn, it's now the druid's turn over here. End of surprise round, the druid's going to rush forward here. And do a 5th-level Cure Wounds. On Kevdak.
Taliesin: No!
Marisha: I mean, he doesn't have an arm, he doesn't have the arm. That was-- he can't get that back.
Liam: He can't get the bone or stuff, I hope.
Marisha: I know, how does that work if you only have half your--
Liam: Ask that guy.
Matt: All right, we're looking at 5d8.
Sam: You know what? Fuck it. I'll Counterspell that.
Matt: Yeah, it's too high, or no, okay. So. It's at a fifth level. Go ahead and roll for it, adding, so it's d20 plus five, plus two because of your bardic knowledge.
Laura: That's not concentration, it doesn't do anything.
Sam: It's not concentration, right, Counterspell? So what do I do, just a d20?
Matt: Roll a d20, add seven.
Sam: 17.
Matt: Let me check here real fast. Plus the spell's level. Yeah. It's dispelled.
Sam: It's dispelled?
Matt: Yeah, Counterspell. (cheering)
Matt: It was 15, was what he had to beat.
Marisha: MVP this fight!
Taliesin: Oh my god, Sam. Oh my god.
Liam: Scanlan's going to Disneyworld!
Matt: Okay. (laughs) All right. That ends his turn. Now. So. This guy here, let's see. Got to stand up for this one, pardon me.
Sam: Oh, shoot.
Laura: Shit. Shit.
Ashley: Should we just take a break or something?
Sam: The benches we're sitting on are covered in so much ass sweat right now.
Matt: We'll say for the sake of this, going to put him up there.
Sam: Who dat? Who's up there? What's going on right there?
Matt: This guy jumps up this way.
Sam: Hey wait, well, that's where I am, I don't want him to come up there!
Matt: Too bad.
Taliesin: Does he get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: These two guys rush forward and grab these innocents here.
Laura: Oh my god. This is where it all turns.
Ashley: Because I fucking fell off the fucking roof.
Matt: Yeah, into the middle here, towards the fire.
Liam: Head of the snake.
Marisha: Into the fire? What?
Matt: Pushing them towards the fire with what remains of their movement. Let's see, this guy's going to move in towards Grog there. This archer's going to get back up--
Sam: (belches) Pardon me. Was that out loud?
Marisha: It's okay, we're not live.
Laura: No!
Matt: Well actually, no, archers aren't part of this movement. This guy here's going to move into Grog there.
Sam: Now he has seven people attacking him.
Matt: I don't know what to tell you, man. These guys here, seeing, hah. This guy's going to be up with this one here. This guy can't really get over there, so he's going to go ahead and rush forward.
Laura: How many people are there? I feel like there's so many more people than there were.
Taliesin: How do you own this many models?
Laura: Why are you doing this to Pike? Stop hurting her!
Sam: Only you can protect her.
Ashley: We should've killed the guys first.
Taliesin: There's no should'ves, this is what we got.
Ashley: Okay guys, we can do this, we can do this.
Marisha: It was going pretty well.
Laura: Why did it all turn?
Marisha: How did he fucking scale that fast?
Laura: Because he can roll acrobatics just like we can!
Matt: Because they're-- yeah, you guys can do it, they can do it too. And they're pretty strong. So he basically runs up, puts the sword on his back, jumps up onto the roof, pulls the weapon. He doesn't manage to get an attack on you, because it took all of his movement to get up there. But he gets up there.
Marisha: No one wants to fuck with the elemental? Really? No one?
Matt: Right now, you're not a huge threat to them at the moment and they're both going to focus actually on you, Scanlan. When it gets around to their turn, though. This guy's going to go ahead and pull both of these innocent folk in front of them as a shield. This guy's going to get freaked out, rush around the building and try to escape there. Okay. So! Bringing us into the combat portion of the round, Grog, you have two more attacking you. This is the bladestorms.
Travis: Bladestorms?
Matt: With advantage, that's going to be a 14.
Travis: That'll miss. I haven't said that much tonight.
Matt: 18?
Travis: That misses.
Matt: So first one, both attacks swinging across you, you're feeling it on your back, but it's catching most of your armor and part of your flesh that is nice and calloused and does not really do any damage. The second one rolls a 20. Second one, and second attack on the second one is a 21.
Travis: That hits, yeah.
Matt: Yeah. Okay. So you get a critical and hit on this one. So this is the bladestorm. Critical is going to be 16, eight points of slashing damage on that one. And the next one's going to be four points of slashing damage. This is already halved. Just so you know. So that's that round there. Against Pike, only one of them could get to you and still attack this round, so Pike, that's 19?
Ashley: Misses.
Matt: And that's going to be a 15.
Ashley: Misses.
Matt: So one strikes against you, hits the back of the armor and streaks off, so you spin around as the second blade comes around and you deflect it with the shield angrily.
Marisha: Yes!
Ashley: This is so fucking stressful!
Matt: That brings us back to the top of the initiative order. Vex, you're up.
Sam: What, they just approached me, they didn't attack me?
Matt: Oh, there was the one guy that got up there with movement. Thank you for the reminder. So before that happens, actually, reminder, this one did have enough movement to get up there and still get attacks off on you.
Laura: Okay, he's attacking Percy.
Sam: No, he's attacking me.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: That's going to be a 13 with the first strike.
Sam: That misses.
Matt: Misses, second one's going to be a 22.
Sam: That just hits. (laughter)
Matt: All right, that's going to be 17 points of slashing damage from that greatsword, whoosh. I need you to go ahead and make a concentration check.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Yeah, you have Warcaster, so you have advantage on that.
Laura: Come on, Scanlan.
Sam: 15-- plus anything?
Matt: It's a constitution.
Sam: Ooh. Plus two. 17.
Matt: So 17.
Taliesin: That's pretty good.
Matt: Going to check it real fast, concentration here-- plus ten, half the damage you take. So that would be ten, yeah, you maintain concentration.
Laura: Oh, thank god.
Travis: We might as well just be doing this on a treadmill, because I think I'm pretty close to 130?
Matt: All right, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to fly out of the window on the broom.
Liam: The roof blows off.
Laura: Out of the window.
Matt: Where do you want to go?
Laura: I'm going to fly down and I'm going to shout, Grog! Raise your arm! And I'm going to go down and I'm going to hit his hand with the Pokeball.
Liam: Shit.
Matt: You're going to scoot by here?
Laura: I'm above, I want to be high up in the air but low enough that I can reach down and touch the locket to Grog's hand.
Matt: Okay, it's a good thing Kevdak is paralyzed, because otherwise he'd get an attack on you.
Laura: I know, I know.
Matt: This will put you in range for their strikes, so you're going to have to stay in place or move past and suffer five attacks of opportunity.
Laura: Wait, all of them can attack, but I'm in the air!
Matt: But for you to get low enough to hand him that, they all have big double greatswords, and they're-- well, half of them are half-giants. So you can do this. As you swish up, which you've already said you're going to do, you fly up and you reach down.
Laura: With the locket and I hit.
Matt: With the locket and you hand over to him, do you--
Laura: I don't hand it to him.
Matt: Okay. So you just hold it there?
Laura: I'm putting Grog in the fucking locket.
Matt: Oh.
Travis: She's trying to medevac me.
Matt: I misunderstood what you were trying to do. All right, so, what--
Laura: I want to fly by and poof and keep going.
Matt: What's it say again?
Laura: It's a wisdom save, but if it's a willing person they can go in.
Matt: Yeah. So, Grog, are you willing?
Travis: Well. Yes.
Matt: And with that, as you reach down and touch Grog with it, you see Grog's form shimmer for a second into dark shadow, and then vanish inside--
Laura: And I want to fly on past and go up to the next roof.
Matt: Okay. So Grog is currently off the table as he's locked inside the gauntlet.
Laura: Where should I go, where should I go?
Matt: Where are you going? As you rush away, you do get--
Laura: I'm going to fly back into the-- I'm going to fly around the back of the big building.
Matt: Back here, you mean?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. We'll say for the purposes of this, you are back here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As you fly off from doing this, all of them swing wide at you, that's five attacks of opportunity against you. That's 20.
Laura: Hits.
Matt: That is 17.
Laura: It did? What'd you, what'd you give me?
Travis: Yeah, she gave you, she handed out, before we moved out.
Laura: Oh, that's right, she gave me a blessing.
Matt: Well, it's Aid, you have 15 extra hit points. So that's what it is.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Ashley: I thought it was the armor class goes up one.
Sam: I got 15 extra hit points.
Matt: Yeah, Aid just gives you guys extra hit points. So anyway. 17. Doesn't hit. All right. So three more attacks. That was cocked. 19?
Laura: It's my armor class.
Matt: All right, 26?
Laura: Fuck. Balls. Shit. Mother bitch.
Matt: And that's 19 again. So four attacks hit you.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: First one is for 14 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Next one, hoo, that's eight, 12 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Okay.
Sam: Doubled. Halved.
Taliesin: Stop it! Don't be helpful!
Matt: Nine plus four-- another 13 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Dammit. Okay.
Matt: And the last one. That's going to be 15 points of slashing damage.
Laura: Great, cool, great. I'm fine and I'm just going to keep going.
Matt: You streak off as all these blades hammer into your side, cutting the bottom of your feet, one of them hits you in the back of the neck and curves across your lower back, and as you pull away clutching it, you look at your hand with the blood pooling in the middle of your palm, and you look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of a human inside the gem that's currently mingling with all the blood that's smeared across your body, as all of a sudden you coast around, through the air, the wind whirling past you, and you spin around towards the top of the Margrave's estate. And you can hear the blood in your body-- (heartbeat sounds)-- in your ears as you start getting a little dizzy and realizing just how rough you are at the moment from that exchange.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: Technically you'd probably be higher than this. Up there, if you wanted to fly around. Okay. So. That ends your turn?
Laura: That-- yeah.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: I'm going to use my bonus action to dash, and hasted I get 24 squares of movement on this board.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: I'm going to drop off the roof, staying along the wall, I should be able to take a diagonal at that corner and totally avoid Greenbeard.
Matt: Oh, you mean, dodge off--?
Liam: I want to go, no, I want to go straight this way. Towards the tree, and drop.
Matt: Towards the tree, drop off here?
Liam: All right. Yep. I want to go along the wall. I can swoop around it and avoid Greenbeard, I'm going to run past this barbarian, she'll probably take an attack but I'm wearing that cloak so she's at disadvantage. I'm going to run up to Kevdak and I'm going to stab him twice-- I should get sneak attack damage and a crit, because he's frozen.
Matt: You do.
Liam: Then I'm going to run the fuck out. That's what I'd like to do.
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: You rush up, you manage to avoid Greenbeard, there is one of these guys there who was holding his place, seeing what things were going on, he had no target at the moment, was staying nearby. With disadvantage, that is 21?
Liam: Misses. 22.
Matt: 22!
Liam: Daggers out, hasted. Raven Queen armor, fuck y'all.
Matt: As you dart past, this blur of dark motion swings towards you, and where it is about to catch some of the armor, there's a burst of black feathers that lift behind where the blade struck through. As you dart up right into the face of Kevdak, who's like, (strained sound), trying desperately to resist the effect of this. Go for it. Advantage on the attacks.
Liam: Okay. Advantage on all these, right right right.
Laura: Oh my god. Ermagerd.
Liam: Ermagerd. 22 for the first, which hits. Ah, yeah, they both hit. And 26 for the second. First one. Three plus-- oh my god. Three plus-- Eight, ten, 16, 22, 23, 29, 32. Which is doubled to 64 plus six.
Matt: Well, 32 plus six, because he takes half-damage.
Liam: Right, well, let's get it up to the top and then halve it. So 32 to 64 plus six is 72 halved.
Matt: Right, 72 halved puts you at 36.
Liam: That's the first, and then the second one does two plus six is eight, no, two and, da-ba-ba-ba--
Laura: Four, right?
Liam: That's just the dice is doubled, so four, it's ten.
Matt: All right.
Liam: And I'd like to use the rest of, well, go ahead.
Matt: So yeah, so as you rush up, you slam your dagger square into the side of his body, and as you push it inside, you can see his eyes glancing back down towards you, held in place, his arm broken, still dangling from the little elements of ligaments that keep it shifting there. With the impact of the slam, it swings from the sheer force of the blow. As you push the blade to the hilt and even further in, you feel your hands actually push into the wound itself about an inch, your fingers getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the interior of his body. As you push up inside, you pull back, pulling the blade around, in your pommel, and jam it over the top of the shoulder, into the side of his body, the muscle flexes from the tension of the Hold Person spell, managing to reduce a portion of the damage, but it left a pretty serious wound.
Liam: Any movement I have left, I want to use to run up to the other side of the wall that Keyleth is on. If I have enough, I'll climb up, if not, I'll go behind that barrel. But if I, before I go, quietly I say to Kevdak, your fate is sealed here today, my friend.
Matt: Okay. He does not get an attack of opportunity on you because he is paralyzed, and the guy already took one against you so he already used his reaction, you rush past him. You do not have enough movement to get to the top, but you do get to the corner right where the barrel is. Okay?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: That ends your turn. It's now the archers' turn.
Laura: Oh god.
Sam: Oh god. So much bloodshed.
Travis: Can we do some recreational drugs or something? Take the edge off?
Laura: We're going to, we're all going to die.
Sam: All we got to do is get Kevdak and they're fucking lost.
Taliesin: I've got a Scrooge McDuck-sized pit of Xanax at my house I'm just going to dive into.
Laura: Once we kill him, his gauntlets are going to be there, we have to go in and get his gauntlets.
Sam: Yeah, that's a point, that's a point made. You know who could get them, who's fast and strong? Trinket.
Matt: This guy here is going to go ahead, he's out of range of you, Marisha. Shoving this barrel off the side to try and get away from you.
Taliesin: Attack of opportunity.
Matt: Marisha, you do get an attack of opportunity, it does fall and hit the barrel next to you, I mean, next to Vax. It doesn't hit you, but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the barrel next to your side and rolls off.
Marisha: Rolling terribly.
Matt: What'd you get, Keyleth?
Marisha: Ten total.
Matt: Ten total? Misses.
Marisha: Oh no, oh, I had to roll to hit. I'm sorry, I was rolling damage.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Marisha: I didn't roll to hit. To hit, that is, plus, 16 to hit?
Matt: 16 versus the archer? 17. Just misses.
Sam: You really... blew it.
Taliesin: To be fair, she's a bit winded.
Sam: Oh, she's winded, that's nice, that's nice.
Matt: They're both, having now made out the connection between the mooning and Kevdak holding himself in place, they're both trying to take you out. One of them has disadvantage because you're in its spot and it couldn't get away from you, it had nowhere to go really. So one's taking two attacks at you, Scanlan. That is going to be, heh, a 12.
Sam: Miss.
Matt: And a 26.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: The other one's going to have two attacks with disadvantage against you. That's, even with disadvantage, that's a 21.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: And the other one with disadvantage is a 15.
Sam: Hit.
Laura: What? 15 hits you?
Sam: I am not wearing some things.
Matt: Yeah, it's true. So three attacks hit you.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: The first one is going to be, all right. That's a full ten plus-- 14 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Go ahead and roll your concentration.
Sam: Oh, yeah, that.
Matt: So roll and add two.
Sam: Roll and add two, or?
Matt: Because it's plus your constitution.
Sam: Oh. 19.
Matt: 19? Okay. The next attack deals five points. Go ahead and roll again with advantage.
Sam: 19.
Matt: Damn. All right. And the third one. Yeah, what's your constitution saving throw, it's plus two, right?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: Last one does 11 points of piercing damage to you. And make another series of checks for concentration.
Sam: 17.
Matt: Fine.
Laura: We're fine, we're okay, we're okay?
Matt: That Warcaster feat, man. Okay, that finishes those two guys. This one here's off to the side, this one's going to go ahead and turn around this way and get around the edge. Actually, he's going to--
Laura: I'm going to start crying.
Matt: This one over here didn't notice you swing by over the top, swoosh overhead. It does see Percy on the roof that shot it, you do have partial cover, so. We'll say that's half cover, so plus two to your AC against this guy's two arrow shots against you. All righty. That is 26 to hit.
Taliesin: Well, that hits.
Matt: All right. Second strike. Same thing, 26.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: 18 and 18.
Taliesin: 18 and 18? I can use the-- yeah, I only have one reaction, so. All right.
Matt: So that's nine points of piercing damage with the first shot.
Taliesin: I'll take that.
Matt: And 14 points of piercing damage with the second one.
Taliesin: I'll fight that one, I'll contest that.
Sam: This has been a long fight, guys.
Liam: No, this is like 30 seconds later, if that.
Matt: What are you contesting it with?
Taliesin: Gloves of Missile Snaring.
Matt: How many times can you use that?
Taliesin: It's a reaction. It doesn't say, I can make an attempt to catch.
Matt: Yeah. So go ahead and make the attempt.
Taliesin: That's 14 points?
Matt: 14 points, yeah.
Taliesin: Dexterity modifier, 11, so I can reduce it to three points of damage. I still got hit, so.
Matt: So go ahead and mark that. Okay. And this guy over here at the very top moves over as well and is going to go ahead and take two more shots at Scanlan. Since there's currently not a whole lot he can see in the area that's a threat to him, near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple up on the rooftop another friend of his is currently whaling on, so. Two attacks against you. That's going to be a 19.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: And 23.
Sam: Hit.
Matt: All right. You take another six points of piercing damage. Go ahead and make your--
Sam: Yeah, 20.
Matt: What was it? 20? Okay. Second one is 14 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh, Jesus.
Sam: Six.
Matt: And with that, the Hold Person fades, concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from the nearby Herd archers. You hear a roar across the battlefield, (roars). Currently with one busted arm, no arm on the other side, Kevdak is screaming in terrible pain and anger.
Liam: But he's great at riverdance. (laughter)
Matt: All right, archers finish their turn. It comes to Kevdak's turn. He's going to go ahead and use his bonus action to go ahead and use Second Wind. Heals 17 hit points on that, rolled a ten. He is then going to-- let's see. Huh.
Marisha: No one's around him.
Matt: Yeah, he has no axe. He reaches over and picks up your hammer.
Taliesin: With his broken hand?
Matt: Oh, yeah, no, actually no, he can't do that right now.
Sam: With his beak.
Laura: He kicks the hammer.
Marisha: He, yeah. He teabags it.
Travis: He kills one of his subordinates for letting him--
Matt: Yeah, he turns to one of his subordinates to the side and says, "One of you, pick that up. The rest of you, kill them." And looks over to the other two innocent that are on the ground right now. He then is going to go ahead and start moving over towards Greenbeard.
Sam: Because he moves.
Matt: Yes?
Sam: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?
Laura: Oh, the Spiritual Weapon!
Matt: A Spiritual Weapon is technically not a creature. It doesn't get a reaction. It's only on a bonus action you get a chance to attack with it. Yeah. He's going to move over here, around the flames, up to Greenbeard. Okay. That finishes his turn, there's not much else he can do at this point. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Pike, how you doing?
Ashley: I'm at 20. I'm pretty rough. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. I have an idea to try and get out of it if I need to.
Sam: Kevdak or Pike?
Laura: They're all clustered right there. If you have something that does area.
Sam: They are, I don't care about them, I just care about Kevdak.
Liam: End the fight, Scanlan.
Laura: Well, Greenbeard can probably heal Kevdak.
Sam: All right.
Marisha: That's probably what he's going over there for.
Sam: I don't think I'll be able to do a Fireball without hitting either Kiki or that innocent.
Marisha: I'm fine, I haven't taken any damage.
Taliesin: She's up 60 bonus hit points.
Marisha: No, I'm up 90 bonus hit points and I haven't taken any damage.
Sam: All right. I'll do the same thing, then. Shit.
Matt: What're you doing, Scanlan?
Sam: Yep. The Wand of Fireballs again.
Matt: How many--
Sam: I have seven charges, I've used three, I'll use three more.
Matt: Okay, where, in the center here at Kevdak?
Sam: Yes, Kevdak is the center square.
Matt: That would hit that archer.
Sam: Would it hit that innocent?
Matt: It would hit those innocents there, both of those innocents.
Sam: Okay. Angle it a little over towards Kiki so it doesn't hit the innocent?
Matt: Yeah, with your angle, you could angle it this way.
Sam: Oh, would it hit Vax that way?
Matt: Yeah, it would.
Liam: It's all right. Do it.
Sam: Okay, I'll kill the innocent.
Liam: Do it!
Sam: I'll kill the innocent.
Liam: I can dodge that shit! I can dodge that shit!
Laura: Scanlan! Don't hurt the innocents!
Sam: I said it already, it's too late.
Matt: Yep. So Scanlan fires the Fireball at Kevdak, it detonates.
Liam: I could've avoided it completely.
Sam: Okay. Yes. Do I just roll? 10d8.
Taliesin: 10d6.
Sam: Six. Six, yes.
Matt: Kevdak, save for that, yeah, he makes his save.
Marisha: Gah, fucking fucker.
Matt: Because it's DC 15. Greenbeard also makes his save.
Sam: 42.
Matt: 42. Damn. (counting) Ten. So Kevdak takes ten points of fire damage.
Sam: Ten? He made his save.
Matt: Because he made his save for half damage, and then he takes half that from his rage. Greenbeard takes 21. He's looking rough, Greenbeard is now burned and (grunts) is looking a bit frenzied at this point. The archer does make the save, high dex, they take 21 points on him.
Sam: (belches) Pardon me.
Matt: This archer there also makes it. However, that one's taken-- no, that one hasn't taken a lot of damage, it was that one over there. This one here does also make his save.
Sam: Ah, Jesus. These guys are unkillable.
Marisha: They all made their saves.
Laura: Surprise attack would've been really good on these guys.
Matt: That guy there does make his save, they're all rolling 15 or above on this.
Laura: God.
Matt: This guy here rolls a natural 20 on his save.
Laura: Fuck all of them!
Matt: Well, that was the innocent there.
All: Oh.
Marisha: Good job, guy.
Matt: It's still 21 points of damage for a peasant, he is incinerated and you hear the horrible scream of pain as--
Sam: Hey, we killed something, guys!
Laura: That was the first thing we killed in this fight.
Matt: First thing you killed in this fight was an innocent villager.
Laura: That is terrible.
Matt: And with that scream that echoes in the back of your mind, knowing the decision you made, a little part of your heart sinks in your chest. However, Keyleth, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity save as well.
Marisha: Yeah. On it. Natural 19.
Matt: All right, so you take 21 points of fire damage.
Sam: Even though I can't see her--
Matt: And actually, that guy technically would be-- yeah, that innocent there would also be in range. He doesn't make his save, he is also incinerated. Both of them burn.
Marisha: Whoops.
Laura: Two peasants dead.
Sam: Sorry.
Matt: All right. So.
Sam: Even though I can't see her, I'm so connected to her, can I try to heal Pike with a big shout?
Matt: As a Healing Word spell? A creature you can see within range, so no, you have to be able to see her to aid her.
Sam: Okay.
Matt: Which you could do if you wanted to risk it.
Sam: I don't know if I want to move, this guy is on me.
Taliesin: Yeah, but you're also getting pummeled by arrows.
Laura: That's true.
Taliesin: So maybe standing there is not necessarily the--
Laura: Like, up and over would probably be better.
Sam: He's going to take a whack at me.
Taliesin: He's going to take a whack at you in a minute anyway.
Liam: Can't you stay alongside him the whole time?
Laura: Yeah. If you're within five feet of him, he doesn't attack.
Liam: Just circle him.
Sam: Okay. I'll circle. I don't know, I can't even really see where I am, but. Yeah.
Liam: Just going around him. Kitty-corner.
Matt: So yeah, you get over this side here.
Liam: Oh, he's dead.
Laura: (laughs) Every time.
Matt: All right, so you move around him. And you see Pike now surrounded by a number of the barbarians.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: You can use your bonus action to heal her if you'd like.
Sam: You have some plan or something, right?
Ashley: I mean, who the fuck knows if that's going to fucking work?
Sam: My healing is barely anything. So I'll inspire you instead, I think.
Ashley: Okay. I'll take it, I'll take it.
Matt: How do you inspire her?
Sam: I sing, (singing) Well then I saw her mace, now I'm a believer, without a trace, of blood in her hair. I'm in love.
All: (singing) Ooh-ahh.
Sam: (singing) I'm a believer.
Matt: (singing) Take your d10.
Ashley: (singing) I'll take my d10, use it later.
Matt: Ends Scanlan's turn. That's the end of your turn. Grog, you are sealed. You have no turn.
Laura: Sorry, Grog. I was trying to keep you from dying.
Matt: Brings us to Greenbeard, who's in a rough place right now. Greenbeard is going to go ahead and finally do something.
Sam: God dammit, he's going to heal fucking Kevdak. It's a new round.
Matt: "Kevdak. Protect the Herd." And he reaches forward and touches him.
Ashley: Fuck that guy.
Sam: Yeah, I'll counterspell that too.
Matt: As he's right there. That's Heal.
Marisha: No, I knew it, I knew it, it's going to heal him for all of his hit points.
Sam: I'm counterspelling.
Matt: Okay, so that's a 6th-level. Go ahead and roll, add seven, and you have to get 16 or higher.
Sam: Can I cast it at a higher level?
Marisha: Heal is a 7th-level spell.
Matt: What level are you casting Counterspell at?
Sam: Do I know what this spell is?
Matt: No, Heal, 70. Old version was almost all your hit points.
Sam: Fifth level.
Matt: At fifth level? All right, so you're casting it at fifth level. Counterspell, mark that off. Less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you use. So it is fifth level, doesn't do anything. Because what fifth level does is it increases the equal level of the spell to cancel. Fifth level, it's a 6th-level spell, so now you just roll. So now roll. Add seven. You're trying to get 16 or higher.
Laura: No!
Ashley: What is it, what is it, what is it?
Sam: It was a three. But I get advantage.
Matt: No.
Sam: Because I'm wearing this.
Matt: With that, Greenbeard reaches out and touches Kevdak. Kevdak roars in pain as all of a sudden the muscles and tendons in his arm reform and in his still-wounded but now-functional arm, he crushes the gauntlet in his hand. "Bring me the other!"
Laura: Shit.
Matt: And you see the other one who was over there reach for the gauntlet.
Marisha: God dammit, I was about to handle that. I was about to handle that! Who's bringing him the gauntlet?
Matt: Greenbeard is now going to go ahead and back behind here, trying to get behind the tree as he now notices he's in the open.
Liam: Burn him up.
Matt: Done his business in that moment. No, as a bonus action, he's going to go ahead and turn into an earth elemental.
Marisha: Who is?
Laura: Greenbeard.
Marisha: Fucking druids! Fucking druids!
Ashley: Kill him! Kill him, Keyleth.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Everything just flipped.
Matt: Now. Percy, you're up.
Sam: Kill Kevdak.
Taliesin: I was going to say, I can't kill Kevdak, he just healed for--
Matt: Kevdak was on the cusp.
Ashley: But now he has 70 extra hit points.
Matt: He does.
Laura: He heals 70 extra hit points? Oh, not 70 percent of his hit points? We can still take him, we can still take him.
Taliesin: Oh, seven hit points.
All: 70.
Travis: 140. We have to hit him for 140.
Taliesin: He healed him 70 hit points. Is he still raging, though?
Matt: Yeah. He continues to rage if he's taken damage since the last round. He's taken a lot of damage.
Marisha: We've got to get those fucking gauntlets.
Laura: Don't let him get the gauntlets, Percy!
Marisha: Where's the gauntlet, can we see the gauntlet on the battlefield?
Matt: It's over here right now, it's on the ground.
Liam: He told somebody to pick it up, but they didn't do it yet.
Taliesin: Okay. No, I can't do that, can I? I look at the guy next to me, I'm going to take a look-- oh god. I'm going to take a running jump off the front of the house.
Sam: Oh my god.
Taliesin: Straight into the--
Laura: In the kill box, you're going into the kill box?
Sam: You're not fast, you're not a fast person!
Taliesin: No, I'm going to jump for the other house.
Matt: All right, go ahead and make an acrobatics check. Oh right, this is a jump, so this would be athletics.
Taliesin: Is it not an acrobatics, I can't do an acrobatics, I can't parkour this? My hands are free.
Matt: I'll say you can make an acrobatics with disadvantage or an athletics with a single roll. Since this is actually the strength of the run, it's not a big distance, so it's not a huge DC for a jump, but it's your call. What do you want to do?
Taliesin: I'll take an athletics. What do you think, athletics or? Oh, no no. I'll acrobatics it with disadvantage.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Yeah, I. Yeah, no.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: You rolled a one? So, as you leap off the side, your foot hits the edge of the tile, and the blade behind you swings. Which I believe is going to hit you with a 20. Is that your AC?
Taliesin: My AC's 18.
Matt: 18, yeah. You take seven plus four, 11 points of slashing damage.
Taliesin: I'm fine with that.
Matt: The blow, however, is just enough to throw you off-kilter, and you go plummeting down into the alleyway.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: Falling prone. You can use your movement to get back up, the remainder of your movement, but you can't move from there. The fall does deal an additional five points of bludgeoning damage.
Taliesin: Don't care.
Matt: All right, so you get back up-- You're now in this alleyway right here facing this line here is all you can really see from your perspective.
Taliesin: Who can I see from my perspective?
Matt: You can see Vax, you can see Kevdak, and you can see this dude here, and an archer, but has partial cover because of the--
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to, as a bonus action I'm going to do a quick heal.
Matt: Okay. Second Wind?
Taliesin: Second Wind. Just to make that go away. God, that's amazing. 18 back, so, I've got--
Matt: Second Wind, man.
Taliesin: And  ow! I'm going to pull out the big gun and I'm going to take a nice heavy serious look at Kevdak. What am I going to hit him with? I'm going to take a sharpshooter shot in his face. I'm going to go for a headshot with the big gun.
Matt: A headshot? With the big gun?
Taliesin: A headshot. With the big, with sharpshooter.
Matt: Right, so you're using the trickshot on him.
Taliesin: Trickshot on sharpshooter. I'm doing a combo. 23 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: I don't feel good.
Travis: I have the worst headache right now.
Taliesin: I feel really bad right now. I don't feel happy. All right, so that's-- first the damage.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: That's 26 points of piercing damage.
Matt: 26 points of piercing damage, reduced to half, 13.
Taliesin: Plus he has to make a constitution saving throw against a DC of 19.
Matt: Constitution, yeah, that's a 23.
Laura: Wait, what?
Marisha: He just made his constitution save.
Matt: He's got a high constitution, saving throws, it's kind of his thing.
Taliesin: Reloading, taking another shot. I don't care, I don't care.
Matt: Same thing, sharpshooter?
Taliesin: Same thing, sharpshooter, I'm going to--
Matt: Any other trickshots you're going to use, or? Deadshot, anything you want to use?
Laura: This is heroic death music right now.
Taliesin: I hate this music you're playing.
Matt: I could switch it up, if you want.
Taliesin: No no.
Liam: Benny Hill?
Taliesin: I'm going to drop a grit for advantage, because--
Matt: Okay, for deadeye shot?
Taliesin: Deadeye with sharpshooter.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: That's good. It can only go up from there. And we do, all right. That's 19, 26 to hit, that hits.
Matt: With the minus five?
Taliesin: Oh, yeah, no, that's with the minus five, how about that, I rolled a 19.
Matt: Yeah. Great, yeah, so go ahead and roll damage on that.
Taliesin: Asshole, asshole, that's better.
Laura: (laughs) He's saying 'asshole, asshole, asshole'.
Taliesin: That is a seven. So that's 17, 18, 19, 20. 30. 36 points of damage.
Matt: 36 halved to 18.
Taliesin: 18. And that's my two shots so I'm not reloaded.
Matt: That's your three attacks. Shot, reloaded, shot.
Taliesin: Shot, reloaded, shot. I'm now going to burn my action surge.
Matt: Okay, angry Percy's angry.
Taliesin: Can I-- I was going to say, can I burn that as a run or can I only burn that as an attack?
Matt: As part of the function, it's like-- You can use your action as a dash, so you could.
Taliesin: I'm going to use my action as a dash to, oh fuck, there's no way around, is there? Fuck it, then, I'm taking another shot.
Matt: All right, so your fourth attack is a reload, fifth is an attack. Go for it. Is this deadeye as well or just regular?
Taliesin: This is sharpshooter as well, no deadeye.
Matt: Okay, sharpshooter, go for the shot.
Taliesin: 23 to hit.
Matt: 23 hits.
Taliesin: I want to save some grit for some problems. (raspberry)
Sam: That's not bad.
Taliesin: Yeah it is.
Marisha: Wait. Did you roll that?
Taliesin: Oh fuck, yeah, thank you! That's the wrong one. Oh, that's so much better.
Matt: Hah, you rolled a 20-sider instead of a 12?
Taliesin: I can't count, my brain.
Laura: We're all breaking.
Marisha: I know, we're breaking under pressure.
Taliesin: 32 points of damage? 32 points of damage.
Matt: 16 points of piercing damage, all right.
Taliesin: And a reload.
Matt: And a reload. That's your turn. Percy is done, dealing a grand total of 47 points of damage in that round. (cheering)
Laura: That's good!
Sam: And I did ten, so we're almost back to where we were.
Marisha: Okay, angry at the fact that I'm not doing much, I'm going to slowly, for flavor, my air elemental's going to start burning a little fire, I'm going to drop my air elemental and I'm going to do Firestorm.
Matt: Okay, Ryan, I need the mini-box that was not brought.
Ashley: (singing) Mini-box.
Liam: Borrow the Thordak mini.
Laura: What if we all die and the dragons take over everything?
Liam: No. No.
Sam: You know, it's this kind of intense fun that you can get in every Loot Crate. (laughter)
Matt: Dammit, Sam.
Sam: Every month, you'll be on pins and needles to see what's in this box.
Matt: All right, for the time being, I'll use this one here. All right, so Keyleth, you revert back.
Marisha: I revert back.
Matt: We'll use this barmaid for the time being.
Laura: You're a barmaid.
Marisha: Aw, I've been demoted.
Liam: Beers for everybody.
Taliesin: We were at the Ren Faire, to be fair.
Marisha: This is alternate timeline version.
Matt: All right, so, Keyleth, what are you doing? You dropped form.
Marisha: I drop form and I'm going to Firestorm all up in this bitch.
Matt: Oh, shit. All right. What are you firestorming, where, what are you doing?
Marisha: Seventh level, so it's ten ten-square-feet. So let's do like--
Matt: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Marisha: Ten ten-foot cubes.
Sam: Jesus. Well see, those peasants would've died anyway, it's not me, it's her, she did it.
Marisha: I could've gone around them.
Matt: So how do you want to arrange this here?
Marisha: So let's start, can I do ten including this archer, ten?
Matt: You can do there, which would burst off the corner, it would hit Kevdak, the archer, and Greenbeard.
Liam: Set that tree on fire.
Marisha: Actually, as part of the spell I can choose to not set the tree on fire. So I choose to spare the tree.
Matt: All right, the tree is spared.
Marisha: All plant life is spared.
Taliesin: Vegan. Sorry.
Marisha: I am not a vegan. From there-- is that a guy, who's that, who's that?
Sam: They're all baddies.
Laura: Everything's bad unless they've got a red ring around them.
Ashley: Kill 'em, baby, kill 'em.
Liam: C'mon, Red!
Laura: C'mon, Kiki!
Ashley: C'mon, Kiki!
Marisha: Another one there.
Matt: Okay, so we have there. There. You'd be able to get one that wouldn't actually hit any of them.
Marisha: That's fine, and then that one. Bam. And then let's go. Can I go four, and then--
Matt: Six, seven, and that's about all you can get.
Marisha: And that got all of these guys? And then can I go eight, nine, get this guy--
Matt: Eight, nine, ten, it wouldn't be able to get that far over. I mean, you could-- (counting).
Marisha: And get all of 'em?
Matt: You could probably get this section there, yeah. Because they're all pretty clustered, just barely.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: And you're doing an "S", which is cool.
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage on that, Keyleth.
Marisha: Zorro!
Laura: Sorro!
Marisha: Okay, ten-- Sorro! Sorry.
Laura: What are you rolling, what is the damage?
Marisha: 10d10. Or no, sorry, sorry. 7d10. Wait. Let me double-check. Let me double-check what it is.
Laura: That's a lot. All tens.
Matt: I'd say you'd be able to get this guy, this guy you wouldn't be able to, but all the rest of these you could. As long as you get over there.
Marisha: 7d10. Okay. 7d10.
Matt: 7d10. Dexterity saving throws, correct, against your spell DC?
Marisha: Uh-huh, which my spell DC is 19. Eight.
Sam: Oh, some of those are good.
Marisha: Some of those are good. Plus six, so that's 14, 16, 18, 19. Another nine, around another-- 29.
Matt: 29 total points of fire damage?
Marisha: 29 total points of fire damage.
Matt: Hm. Okay. Kevdak takes-- he failed his save, but he takes half that, so 14 points of fire damage.
Sam: He's back to where he was before the Heal.
Matt: Yep. Greenbeard takes the full. 29.
Laura: But now he's a tank. Greenbeard's an earth elemental.
Matt: Yeah, Greenbeard's taking earth elemental damage now. That archer, that archer burns up, archer screams in pain as it incinerates from the Firestorm.
Sam: Wait, somebody died?
Laura: An archer died!
Sam: Oh, thank god.
Matt: That bladestorm there takes 29 damage. That guy there, they all take 29 damage. That druid fails.
Taliesin: Are they on fire now too?
Laura: They're all burning to death slowly.
Matt: 29 damage there. That druid and the rest of them, fail, success, fail with a one, fail. Fail with another one. Okay, so 29, all righty.
Liam: While the entire square sets on fire, Vax quietly and quickly falls a little deeper.
Ashley: Falls a little deeper in what?
Liam: In love.
Laura: Oh. Aww!
Ashley: Oh. Aww!
Matt: All right, cool. All righty.
Marisha: I light Vax's fire in the meantime.
Matt: So. That finishes your turn with a Firestorm?
Marisha: No it does not, I'm going to use a bonus action to do Grasping Vine.
Matt: Too high-level, you can't do it, Grasping Vine's a 4th-level spell. You can only do up to a second level as a bonus.
Sam: Can you use your bonus action to heal?
Marisha: I could do a bonus action to heal somebody. Who's down really bad, can I see Pike?
Matt: You can't see Pike right now, Pike is out of the room.
Laura: Can you see me up in the air?
Marisha: Are you rough? Have you taken some damage?
Laura: Can you see me in the air?
Marisha: Can I see Vex flying off into the distance?
Matt: Currently, roll a perception check.
Marisha: Not great, 14.
Matt: Nope. You do not see Vex, you have no idea where she is right now, you just saw her.
Marisha: I see, I can't hurt him anymore, I see Scanlan, that's all I can really see?
Matt: Scanlan you can see over there, but even then he's too far away for a Healing Word, I think.
Marisha: That's it, that's my turn.
Sam: Well, kill Kevdak, then.
Matt: Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right, so I'm going to look at the three around me, one of them fell off the roof, so there's only three there, right?
Matt: Correct, there are three, ah. There are five there total, actually.
Ashley: Well, one of them fell the roof.
Liam: You accidentally knocked one off the roof, Matt, five minutes ago.
Matt: That's good to know.
Ashley: There's how many there?
Matt: There's four of them there.
Liam: He's drunk, fell asleep.
Matt: No, it's fine.
Ashley: I'm going to tell them.
Laura: I'm a barbarian.
Ashley: I'm a barbarian.
Matt: There we go. That'll work.
Ashley: I'm going to look at them and I am going to Command all four of them to attack each other. At fourth level.
Liam: And they're all by their allies so they should get advantage on each other.
Matt: Well, technically it doesn't work that way. All right. All right, so. What's the DC on that?
Matt: Spell DC.
Sam: Spell DC.
Ashley: 16.
Matt: That's a failure. That's a failure. That's a 20, so that succeeds. That's a failure. So one of them succeeded, three of them didn't.
Travis: What a call. What. A. Call.
Ashley: Well, hopefully, hopefully.
Matt: So. Does that end your turn?
Ashley: No.
Matt: Your bonus action still, what are you going to do?
Sam: Heal thyself!
Matt: You do still have Spiritual Weapon up if you want to use your bonus action to do that.
Ashley: I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon.
Matt: The Spiritual Weapon can only move 20 feet.
Ashley: Say again?
Matt: It can only move 20 feet as a bonus action.
Sam: Oh, so it can only catch up to him.
Liam: Diagonally. Right on his ass. Yeah!
Taliesin: It flies over objects, too.
Matt: But you can't see him right now, you'd have to move over to have him in view.
Laura: And one of them would get an opportunity now because--
Matt: One of them would, if you were to try and dodge past, yeah. What do you want to do?
Ashley: I have to move anyway.
Matt: It's up to you. What do you want to do?
Ashley: I'm going to try to-- yeah.
Matt: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you try to tumble in your armor between the legs of one of the guys in front of you.
Sam: Tumbling!
Laura: You can do it, Pike!
Ashley: I have inspiration?
Sam: Oh, you do have inspiration! And you'll need it, it looks like.
Matt: Whatever your acrobatics is.
Sam: With advantage. With triple disadvantage.
Matt: What is it?
Ashley: 14?
Matt: 14. Let me double-check here real fast.
Sam: Oh, he's going to the book for this. For a somersault!
Taliesin: And isn't this guy technically flanked by enemies now?
Ashley: I mean, I'm not going to somersault, I'm going to sneak around.
Liam: Can't she run under his balls and--
Sam: It's okay, let the DM DM.
Matt: Let me deal with it, guys. You don't want to prod me right now.
Sam: Chapter three  Somersaults.
Taliesin: All that I have and more.
Liam: Matt, you do amazing, every week you do amazing and we're all going to die.
Matt: Let's see the roll there. All right, so you manage to barely push past, but you do trigger a second attack of opportunity to do so. From that guy, that big half-orc there that gets in your way. So that's two strikes against you, that is a natural 20. And that's going to be a 13.
Ashley: Okay, well that misses.
Matt: So that is a pretty low roll, ten points of slashing damage.
Ashley: I'm alive, I'm alive.
Matt: What are you at? What're you at?
Ashley: I am at 15.
Matt: So as you dodge past, get slammed by two blades, you arc around the corner and they're all looking at each other, confused, some of them affected by this magic they aren't expecting, and you rush around and you see in the distance Kevdak, who's now getting shot a couple times, gets set on fire, flames burst up, and he starts screaming out in pain. As you turn the corner, you look over at your Spiritual Weapon, and you can nudge it forward. Right there, its full movement, 20 feet. Go ahead and make an attack with your spell attack modifier. Does not have advantage because he is no longer paralyzed.
Ashley: 20.
Matt: 20 hits. Go ahead and roll damage. So 4d8 plus four.
Sam: Oh wow, that's good.
Taliesin: Oh no, it doesn't fuck around.
Matt: Still halved, but.
Liam: Yeah well. C'mon Sarenrae.
Ashley: Okay. Plus what?
Matt: Plus four.
Ashley: All right, 24.
Matt: 24 halved, to 12.
Ashley: Fuck!
Travis: I know, I forget about it too.
Matt: Yeah, I know.
Travis: I forget about it too.
Taliesin: This is how we all feel watching you fight, by the way.
Matt: So the blade drifts over and in a giant arc swings down with a resounding shining metallic slam. The blade streaks through and cuts this swath, the blade doesn't stop, it passes through and leaves this scar across his body of burned radiant energy. (grunt of pain) Looks over and glares at you from across the open cobblestone of this marketplace, and you see for a second that look that Grog saw that caused him to drop his weapon, you suddenly feel this quake in your soul. This is a powerful entity whose hatred is now bent on you.
Ashley: I can still move a little bit more, right? Because that was only--
Matt: You can if you'd like to. You may take more attacks of opportunity, though.
Laura: What, why?
Matt: In order for her to move further, you might move out of combat with the other guys that are there.
Liam: But they're all attacking each other.
Matt: The Command move means on their next turn they attack each other. Doesn't mean that they're charmed or dominated.
Ashley: But how many feet did I move, how many feet am I able to move anyway?
Matt: That would've been ten feet, you can move 15 more.
Ashley: Okay, I can move 15 more anyway.
Matt: Yeah. But you will take two attacks of opportunity if you move out of range of these two.
Ashley: But wouldn't that be included in the attacks that I just took? If I can move 15 total?
Matt: You can move 25 total because of your tiny feet. You moved ten, you have 15 more feet you can move.
Marisha: Your tiny feet.
Ashley: Should I stay? I'll just stay.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: You need to heal yourself, dude.
Ashley: I know, I know, I know.
Matt: Barbarians are going now. This one picks up the gauntlet and is going to rush over.
Marisha: Fuck!
Matt: And bring it to Kevdak, and he's going to go ahead and hold it there, as Kevdak takes his arm and--
Marisha: Is the arm still in it?
Matt: The arm is still in it, yeah. And he looks at it and takes it with his free hand and clutches it to his chest. And looks around at the other ones, says, "We're going." And he--
Taliesin: Wait, was he holding a weapon?
Matt: Yes, he has no weapons, his weapon was pulled away from him.
Taliesin: I thought someone brought him his weapon.
Matt: Oh, brought the hammer, he brings up the hammer as well, but he doesn't--
Taliesin: But I thought he was hold--I'm trying, yeah, no, I'm desperately trying to give a reason why this couldn't work.
Matt: No, he has no weapon on him currently. He tried to reach for it, but he had no functioning arm at the time. He told someone to pick it up, so someone has your flaming warhammer. These guys here are going to move over here. Move over here. And that one's going to be attacking Pike. Over here, that's two attacks on Pike. That's going to be a 13? And a 14. Rolled really low on that one.
Taliesin: Praise Sarenrae, praise Sarenrae.
Matt: You hear the growl behind you, and without even turning your head, you slam your shield up and deflect one of the blows. Look over your shoulder and glare at it as another one comes down, and this-- you take your mace and swing it in a wide arc over and slam their blade against the stone wall of the side, deflecting the entire attack. As that's happening, both of those guys go forward. Two and a one. Goes up against one of the peasants and strikes and the peasant ducks out of the way and manages to avoid the attacks.
Laura: That's good, that's good.
Matt: This guy here with the giant club goes down and dodges one of the attacks, the other one does come down at 11, yeah, this peasant gets smashed.
Laura: Oh no, was that the little kid?
Matt: No, this was the drunker guy.
Ashley: Well, he didn't feel it.
Taliesin: Died happy.
Matt: All right. That ends their turn, it's the druids' turn now.
Laura: There's so many. They all get to go.
Sam: That's how they all feel when we attack.
Matt: This druid here is going to move forward, seeing you over there, Vax. Reaches out towards you as it only has its 4th-level spells and lower left, because of you, you Counterspell motherfucker. It's going to go ahead and cast Blight on you, Liam. I'm going to need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, as the druid reaches out at you with its hand and says, "Kevdak! Inside!" and concentrates, gripping out. This female goliath, you can see with these thick braids in the back of her head, pulled into a very, very tight braid down to the lower part of her back, reaches out and grasps. You feel the blood begin to pool in parts of your body and your veins turn dark around.
Liam: Now, constitution save, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: This is real bad. What is that? That's eight.
Sam: Eight total?
Matt: Total. All right.
Liam: I'm Kate Moss, man.
Taliesin: Don't make that face.
Matt: You take 41 points of necrotic damage.
Marisha: Wow.
Matt: As you feel the energy pulse through your entire body and it's like all the blood in your body momentarily becomes toxic. Your vision blurs and you feel the dizziness hit you and you almost stumble to one knee but you catch yourself against the wall.
Liam: It just halved me.
Matt: That ends the druids' turn. Now the blademongers are going to go. All right. These guys are all going to attack each other.
All: Yeah!
Matt: Except for that one.
Taliesin: Are they not going to attack him as well?
Matt: Well, one of them's going to go ahead and attack Pike, because it was the one that wasn't affected by the Command spell. That's going to be a 19. No? Okay!
Ashley: Just misses.
Matt: And a 13. No. Cannot hit this armored little gnome, who's pushed against the wall, and you're deflecting blows and taking hits against the armor that are denting the front of it, and you're grinning and bearing it.
Ashley: I'm growling! Arrr!
Travis: Arr!
Ashley: Arr!
Matt: These guys are attacking each other now. That is seven-- it hits. They can't hit you but they can hit each other. Two attacks against that guy, and then the other guy. Both hit. So the first guy takes 14. 24 points of damage.
Sam: Are you okay?
Ashley: 15.
Sam: Do you want us to do something?
Ashley: I can. I'm like--
Marisha: Just focus on the mission.
Ashley: Focus on the mission at hand.
Matt: Ends up-- That guy there then also takes 22 points of damage on them. Okay. They start hacking into each other with their blades suddenly, trying to figure out what's happening. And technically another barbarian strikes, so the third one who actually missed you? That would've been an attack against its own guy, because that was the one that didn't hit, so he would've been-- Once again against this guy. So he deals an additional 13 points of damage against one of the other ones. Okay. Got you. So that finishes their turn there. So these guys here are going to move around the fire, this guy's going to move up here.
Liam: Everyone's at disadvantage with me, just a reminder.
Matt: Yeah. This guy here is going to go ahead and move one, two, three. And then using Greenbeard, who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental arm and alley-oops him up onto the roof. With the acrobatics roll. Rolls a one.
Ashley: He dies!
Matt: This guy gets slammed into the side and falls back to the ground, missing his turn.
Laura: Falls right back down like some other loser that I know of.
Matt: Yeah, (laughs). Greenbeard miscalculates and actually slams him against the wall. And then the goliath sort of slides down. Takes four points of bludgeoning damage from that. (laughter)
Matt: All righty. And that guy there is going to go ahead and strike at the child.
Laura: No!
Matt: A three. And 14.
Marisha: Shifty kid, c'mon.
Sam: He's a little weasel, he's a little weasel.
Matt: No, he's going to hit the kid.
Laura: He's a scrapper, he's dodgy. No!
Matt: Kid gets cleaved.
Laura: We didn't save anybody and we killed ourselves.
Ashley: If we kill everybody, maybe I can raise him.
Matt: They're now trying to find a way to draw you out. They're taking turns doing this, keeping, as each person they strike down they look about the rooftops again for more of you. That's going to go ahead, and these guys here are going to go ahead and start swarming over towards the front. This guy here (counting) can't quite get to you, Vax. This guy here, seeing Percy jump down, is going to go ahead and jump down to meet you from behind. See if he makes his. He fails on a two. He falls prone. Takes--
Liam: "I'm coming. Whoa!"
Matt: He takes 12 points of falling damage
Liam: "Ah, help."
Matt: However, he does use the rest of his movement to stand back up and is going to take two swings at you, Percy. That's going to be a 23 to hit?
Taliesin: I'm going to pull my magic shield, actually, I would have to have a 24 AC for that not to hit.
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, I'm--
Matt: Okay. Second one's a natural 20. So the first strike hits you for 12 points of slashing damage. Second strike, double ones on the crit, so that's four, eight points of slashing damage with the second hit. (laughs) I rolled double ones on his crit, that's really frustrating. You're fine with that. All right, that ends their turn, top of the round, Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: As you're standing there now, bleeding profusely, holding the necklace that holds Grog, what are you doing?
Laura: I'm going to fly over right above Kevdak.
Travis: How high?
Laura: Like a good 50 feet.
Matt: Yeah, that's 50. All right.
Laura: All right. I'm going to Pokeball Grog right out so he can attack straight out of the gate. Just like I would Cannonball Trinket.
Travis: And I am willing.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Aren't you at death's door?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: I'll say essentially because you held your action last turn, if you wanted to go ahead and take your action to do a drop attack on this point here.
Laura: Can this be my bonus, so I'm dropping him out is the bonus, and then I still can attack? I mean, it's only a locket. It's not like it's a whole move.
Matt: Yeah, I'd say it's your bonus action to do it, yeah.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So, Grog, you were released, falling down to land on top of Kevdak with the bloodaxe in a downward arc.
Travis: And a big windup as we're coming down.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Any chance I can make this reckless?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: No! Then they all get advantages against you again.
Matt: Up to you.
Travis: Oh, thank god for that. Natural. 20. Look at it. The first one was a one.
Ashley: Fuck you!
Matt: Ones and twenties, man, you got to stop this. And that's why he did reckless. (screaming and cheering)
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage on this.
Ashley: Get 'im, Grog.
Laura: Does that mean he gets the three 12s again?
Matt: With the Brutal Critical at this level, how many extra dice is it for you?
Travis: Brutal Critical is one additional damage die during critical hits.
Matt: But then that's gone up since you leveled previously.
Travis: That's true.
Matt: So you are now at, I believe-- so Brutal Critical, yeah, 13 increases to two. So you roll an additional 2d12 on the attack. So roll 1d12 plus, you're not raging anymore, because you spent the last round.
Travis: That's right, that's three.
Matt: All right, so plus three.
Travis: So ten.
Matt: Ten. Plus two more d12s.
Travis: 12. So that's 22. And a ten. For a 32.
Laura: And then double that? His crits don't get double?
Matt: You only double the first roll.
Travis: Yeah, double the first, right. Which was ten, so 20, so 42.
Matt: 42, brings it to 21 damage. How do you want to do this? (screaming and cheering)
Marisha: It worked!
Liam: Poetic justice!
Matt: As the shadow fires from the necklace as she holds it aloft, bleeding and shaking, you appear, and dive down in silence. The square coming towards you, as Kevdak, clutching in the one nearly ruined arm, the other arm that you bisected, is turning the corner, about to open the door to dive into the house to avoid it, looks up just in time to see you streaking down. What do you do?
Travis: I say  For Strongjaw! And I sink the axe right into his neck and part him perfectly down the middle.
Matt: With the sheer force of the blow, the weight behind it, and the intent, the axe hits him right in the side of the neck, cleaves off part of his ear, shaves off part of his skin here, exposing the jawbone, hits here, breaks the clavicle, tears through, and every single rib is destroyed. It cuts right through the center of this giant body until it gets to about the midsection where it catches, finally. The upper torso splits open and covers you with gore, however, you still impact, not raging.
Travis: Yep. Nope.
Matt: You take--
Sam: He's going to die.
Travis: Don't care.
Matt: 25 points of fall damage from the impact.
Travis: That will put me unconscious and 21 points under.
Matt: And 21 points under. You have that barbarian ability-- Would that be part of this?
Travis: I have Relentless Rage.
Matt: If you drop to zero hit points while raging, you're not raging. So yeah. As you shout, the blow, in a very Superman-versus-Doomsday way, cleaves him in half, and as you slam into the ground, you pull the axe free as your shattered legbones give under and you fall to the ground. You smile as you see his form crumple, and then you (impact) face-first into the ground before him.
Laura: Who's next? Oh, I'm still going. It's still my turn!
Matt: It's still your turn. You watch as every single Herd member in the entire open square gasps at this whole sight. They all turn hearing you scream "For Strongjaw" and see this happen. As Kevdak's body slumps to the ground, it shrinks back down to its average size, and you crumple to the ground, smiling, and fall next to him. And everyone takes a moment of breathless silence. What are you doing, Vex?
Laura: Oh my god.
Sam: Wait, are you dead, Grog?
Laura: He's unconscious.
Liam: He's unconscious.
Laura: I mean, my only option to heal him is to land and touch him.
Sam: He's surrounded by baddies.
Laura: Well. Fuck it, I'm going to land and touch Grog.
Matt: Okay. What's the speed of the broom?
Laura: I don't know.
Matt: It should say on the broom how fast you can move on it.
Laura: Do I have that somewhere?
Sam: You know, in your broom chapter.
Matt: Here we go, I'll find it for you.
Laura: Oh wait, wait.
Matt: Just a moment, guys. Broom of Flying. Speed of 50 feet. So you moved from over here, which would have put you-- it's about 50 to get there. So you could use your action to dash with it, you'd land, that's all you could do.
Laura: I couldn't do anything else? Okay. Then I guess I'm going to stay where I am and-- Jeez. Can I hold my action? I'm going to hold my action until--
Matt: Yeah, it's an action to feed a potion to anyone.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: What are you going to do, Vex? Hurry up.
Laura: I'm going to hold my action until Grog is healed.
Matt: Okay. Okay.
Laura: And I-- can I shout anything?
Matt: If you want to.
Laura: I'm going to shout, witness Grog Strongjaw, and bend the knee!
Ashley: It's great, it's great, it's great.
Matt: Make an intimidation check.
Laura: Natural 20! (yelling and cheering)
Matt: Don't hit the table, I was going to go inspect it.
Laura: No, I hit, I hit, but it was, it was a 20, I swear.
Matt: No, I trust you guys. I trust you guys.
Sam: It's all ones and twenties. We have these two-sided dice. Just a one and a 20.
Matt: This is going to be an interesting night to explain to the internet, guys. All right.
Liam: You opened it up to the dice, and the dice decided.
Ashley: We witnessed, we witnessed.
Matt: Okay. So. At this point in time, you watch as Greenbeard's form shrinks down and shifts back into his goliath form, still busted, he's looking down at the destroyed, crumpled body of Kevdak, and you there on the ground as well, looking up at you above and hovering. He looks over at the other goliaths nearby here that are rushing in, and they all step out and backwards, inspecting this body. There's a pause, a moment of pause. But they've all paid attention to what you said. That ends your turn. It is now the archers' turn.
Liam: Not me right after Vex?
Matt: I'm sorry, you're up next.
Liam: Yeah. I'm going to use disengage to back a little bit away from them, I'm going to scrabble up the wall-- where's the light, no-- I want to go up by Keyleth.
Travis: You're pointing at the screen.
Matt: So you move around.
Liam: I'm not the first one to do that. And pass her, I want to jump down and land in front of Grog.
Matt: Okay. So you run past there?
Liam: And jump in front of him, between him and-- not Greenbeard, between Grog and everyone over there.
Matt: Okay, so you'd be leaping, technically onto the body of Kevdak is what you'd be doing.
Liam: That's fine.
Marisha: Squish.
Matt: So you land onto Kevdak's form, very angry slash, I'll say for the purposes of this you're there, because Kevdak's body is way too big right now to put on the field.
Laura: But we are so going to loot that.
Marisha: So going to loot that shit.
Matt: All right, you land.
Laura: If we survive this.
Matt: With your hasted movement, make an acrobatics check for the jump.
Liam: That's fine. 25.
Matt: Yeah, you scale up, run, leap, land there, feet sinking into the body.
Liam: And I land on him and I say, Kevdak has fallen. Will you let Strongjaw rise? And I hold my action to attack if they come at me.
Matt: Okay. It's the archers' turn. This archer has its arrow trained on you and is going to hold its action. This archer here is going to move up to see what's happened, dashing to look out and see what happened, doesn't get its turn. This archer here, who's now moved, moves over to this side with its arrow trained on you as well. It's also going to hold its action. And they're all looking at each other at this Mexican standoff moment where they're all poised and ready. Everyone's holding their actions right now. It would be Kevdak's turn, Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm pretty far. I'm going to jump down off the roof and move towards Grog.
Matt: Okay, so you run down. Okay. The guy who was up against you has looked over and is not paying attention at this moment. Make a stealth check.
Sam: Oh. Stealth check. 13.
Matt: 13. As you rush down the thing, he looks over, looks at you and goes, "Hey. Hey!" And can't even catch you, you're too fast. Make an acrobatics check as you leap off the roof.
Sam: 19.
Matt: 19. You gnomish three-point-land in this square. You're right next to Pike now, you've landed next to her. As you're around the corner now, you see Scanlan (impact) right next to you.
Ashley: Hi!
Matt: You've got about 15 more feet you can move if you wanted to.
Sam: Move 15 feet? Okay. I will, can I, I can't take her hand and walk too, she can't move right now.
Matt: No, not at the moment.
Sam: Okay, well I'm going to continue to walk.
Matt: I mean, I could say if you wanted to, you could move half your movement and take her with you.
Sam: Okay, I'll do that. I'll take her with me.
Matt: Okay, you take her hand.
Sam: I'm going to use Healing Word, oh shit, what just happened?
Matt: You and Pike move there, holding each other's hand.
Sam: Okay. I'm going to use Healing Word on Grog, and I'm just going to start chanting, Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!
All: Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw! Strongjaw!
Sam: Communicate that as a Healing Word.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll the heal on that. I also want you to go ahead and make a persuasion check.
Sam: Me?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Heal is eight points. What's that do?
Matt: So you go to zero, and then eight.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: And then persuasion check?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Well, I mean, come on.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: That's 23.
Matt: Okay. Good to know. Finishes your turn, Scanlan--?
Sam: No, I have an action still.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Sam: So I will cast Bigby's Hand and lift Grog up 30 feet like a fucking god. (laughter)
Sam: If he's willing.
Matt: I will say for the purposes of this, because I want to do this, this is ridiculous.
Sam: Oh, I had to cast that at level six, by the way.
Liam: Is it full palm-up, or is it Barcalounger style?
Marisha: Is it like a chair?
Sam: You know what, because he's the god and the hand is subservient, it's the back of the hand like this. It's a dainty lift. (laughter)
Matt: I will say Grog is now currently being held aloft right there.
Marisha: Nice!
Matt: As the hand is clutching Grog Strongjaw, lifting him up into the air, you're conscious now as the hand's holding you on its back and you get up from one knee. Grog, it's your turn.
Liam: Pinkie's up?
Sam: Pinkie's up. Tea-time.
Travis: My herd. Hear me. Fallen is your mighty leader Kevdak, the very goliath swine who would have domesticated you like a common household cat, who would have made you bend a knee to a mere dragon. I show you this. And I reach into the Bag of Holding and I pull out one of the dragon's teeth that is still in there and I toss it into the middle of the square.
Matt: Clatters to the ground at the feet of one of the nearby bladestorms. It stops at his foot. He looks at it, picks it up.
Travis: I would tell you that under the correct rule, and a return of power to this Herd, dragons would bend a knee to the Herd of the Storm. Where is Zanror?
Matt: They all look at each other and Greenbeard hobbles out, still wounded and hurt, into the center of this area.
Sam: Does he have an actual name or is that just his name?
Matt: Greenbeard's his name.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: Steps out into the middle, looking up at you. "Strongjaw. You stand above us all. In a way." (laughter)
Matt: "Claiming dominion over a herd that you fell to and left behind for years. Though you struck down Kevdak, what do you think makes you aligned with the interests of our people?"
Travis: Oh, you mistake me, Seer of the Herd. I do not mean to lead this herd, but rather to empower you to more powerful game. I'm here to inspire your aspirations. Never would I ask you to bend the knee. Only would I ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you can possibly attain. Join me and my fellows. Come to our aid when I call. And with that, we will chase down dragons, gods, and more.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with advantage.
Laura: Come on, come on, come on.
Matt: With advantage on that.
Travis: Fuck. That's only an 11.
Ashley: Can I use War God's Blessing, or?
Matt: I don't think it works for abilities.
Marisha: Can I assist him with a skywrite 'Strongjaw'?
Matt: (laughs) Bing! Strongjaw.
Marisha: I mean a stormcloud above him?
Ashley: Inspo, inspo, inspiration from anywhere?
Matt: It's a little late for that. It's okay. At this point Greenbeard sizes you up from a distance. Everyone else is waiting for a word, you can see everyone is hand on the side of their weapons looking at each other and there's this extremely tense air. Greenbeard turns around and looks to two of the individuals near the front of the building and goes, "Bring out Zanror." And the two of them go inside the door and close it behind them. They step inside the building and there's this long silence. You wait for 30 seconds.
Laura: Can I take a healing potion while they're inside? I'm up on the thing.
Matt: You can, yes.
Ashley: Can I heal Grog?
Matt: Are you going to step up?
Ashley: I can see him.
Matt: You can see him, yeah.
Ashley: So I'm going to cast Heal on him.
Matt: You're going to cast Heal?
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: As you begin to go for your holy symbol, you can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for their weapons.
Travis: Hold! It is not necessary. Brothers, look me in the eye. Has the taste of food lost its appeal? Has the zest for life fallen from your hearts? Living in this domesticated dwelling. I promise you this: hear me, and I promise you adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd.
Matt: The door slams open from the front of the Margrave's home. You see as the two individuals come out with chains over their shoulders as they drag out into the center two individuals. You see another half-giant goliath man, one that you've all seen once before on your way to Kraghammer months and months ago. Well. Yeah, about. You see him swollen in the face, bruised, and in shackles, dragged out and thrown to the ground. And the other one holds over his shoulder another chain. He pulls out behind him a half-giant woman with the hair on the sides of her head shaved, one single long mane of hair, and it looks like she's with child. Also in shackles. And she's pushed to the ground with Zanror. Zanror looks up and you can see him closing his eyes like the daylight itself is very bright and he probably hasn't seen light in a period of time. "Strongjaw."
Travis: Cousin.
Matt: "Well. This is a surprise."
Travis: Your face seems a little different.
Matt: It's at this moment that he looks over and glances, and can see the body of Kevdak on the ground for the first time, and then he goes, "You did this?"
Travis: Scanlan. Lower me down.
Sam: I swoop him down. Do you want to be on the ground or just above it?
Travis: On the ground.
Sam: On the ground. But I release him and I make a fist that clenches right next to him. Just in case anything goes bad.
Matt: So. As you're brought down to the ground, Bigby's Hand sets you gently on the cobblestone.
Travis: I take a few steps forward. Yes. This my work. A debt fulfilled after many, many years.
Matt: (sighs) "I fear the Herd's lost its edge. Priorities. My father had grown docile in this place. But he wouldn't be if whispers hadn't found his ears." And he looks over at Greenbeard. Greenbeard immediately steps back and goes, "Look at him in shackles. This isn't a warrior, this is a slave. Both of 'em." Spits in their direction.
Travis: Strange. I would ask, why is he in shackles? What did Zanror do that would draw this sort of ire from the Herd?
Matt: The one that's holding the chains on Zanror pulls them a little tighter and Zanror's lifted up a little bit off of his leaning-forward position, he's now on his knees and his arms are pulled up, in towards his torso. And Greenbeard looks back towards you. "This skyshield here spoke against his father. He was attempting some sort of a mutiny. But we quelled that right quick. Gave him time to think about it. His father was deciding what to do with this traitor. And his next of kin. You, however, seemingly stopped his trial, so I think it's only fitting that you do the honors of finishing the job." And you can see as you were lifted off the ground and everything, you did not have your weapon with you, as you were on the ground, lifted up. Greenbeard steps over and takes the bloodaxe from the ground, walks up to you, and hands it out, and looks over to Zanror.
Travis: I am sorry, Zanror. But I will make it a glorious death. Bring me the gauntlets as well.
Matt: "Let it be." And two of the other individuals, one of the half-orc individuals looks over, hushed, and starts backing away from this, this is too much for him. There's now this tribal tension, this cultural tension that only exists within the initial Herd and has been only recently adopted by the Rivermaw that were absorbed by the Herd and are still confused by this. Two of the goliaths step over and pull and pry out the somewhat soggy leftover arm of Kevdak.
Laura: Kind of like when you're eating lobster, to get the claw out, yeah.
Liam: Shrinks as it leaves.
Matt: They toss it to the ground before you.
Travis: I stand. Put on the gauntlets.
Matt: Kevdak at this point is still being held up by the chains and says--
Travis: Zanror.
Matt: Sorry, Zanror. Thank you. "It was unbefitting of us all to be living under one of those beasts. Under my rule, we were going to take back our power as a people."
Travis: Quiet yourself. I've heard enough. And I lift the bloodaxe and I say: you are a disgrace to this herd and I will return this herd to power. And I pivot, and I drive the bloodaxe into Greenbeard.
Matt: Oh shit! Roll an attack.
Taliesin: Yeah you do, buddy.
Travis: Reckless?
Matt: If you want to.
Laura: No!
Ashley: Get the fuck out!
Laura: It's a fucking natural 20.
Matt: Roll damage.
Sam: We're going to have to get these dice calibrated later.
Laura: But why does it only happen when it's a story element?
Travis: That's an 11.
Matt: Watch as next week Critical Role implements dice cam. (laughter)
Matt: No, that's awesome.
Laura: Oh, let me take a picture, I'll take a picture.
Travis: So that's 15.
Matt: All right.
Travis: And then two more?
Matt: Two more, yeah.
Taliesin: Watch next week as we fail to open the door to his house for an hour and a half.
Marisha: Yeah, yes, can't roll above a five next week.
Travis: That's 27. 37.
Matt: How do you want to do this?
Sam: Oh, you got it?
Matt: (laughs) He had taken a shit-ton of damage in the battle, and was already moving by--
Taliesin: Yeah, he was pretty low.
Matt: He had like 12 more hit points left, so.
Travis: It seems all the poison came from his head, so I'll remove that from his body.
Matt: And with that moment, (swishing), with a very slick snapping sound, the blade coasts through and the neck retreats as the head continues forward and tumbles to the feet as Greenbeard's body takes an instinctual step backward and then falls, lifeless, in the center of the marketplace. All the rest of the Herd moves for a second, nervously.
Travis: I spin and I say  do you see? Do you see what staying in one place does? This is what weakness looks like. I would return you to the wild. I would return you to power. But you will have to do it under this goliath's rule. Unchain Zanror.
Sam: I point Bigby's Hand like he was too. (laughter)
Matt: As Bigby's hand points to Zanror, the two that are holding the chains move up and begin to unchain them both, taking the shackles off his hands and the female goliath at his side. Eventually he stands up, reaches over and puts his arm around her and says, "I am sorry, Worra."
Travis: Worra.
Matt: Worra. She stands and goes, "Do not be sorry. It seems we've been delivered from our judgment." She looks up towards you. You don't recognize her.
Travis: I don't.
Matt: She's not from the original Herd.
Travis: Zanror, she is quite a beauty. Congratulations.
Matt: "You saved us narrowly being executed, Grog." And he stands up and gets to the front of all the rest of the Herd there. "Call forth the rest of our people. We do not leave this town yet. We claim Westruun home for one more night. For it is tomorrow at dawn, we slam our blades against the hide of a dragon."
Travis: No. This is honor. This is pride. This is a life worth living.
Matt: "Will you join us in this glory and pride, fair cousin Grog? You have proven yourself worthy of life and respect and the might of the Herd of Storms."
Travis: How many do you number?
Matt: He looks about and takes in the mental math of all the people that were killed.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't kill that many.
Matt: I know, you took a few down. "We'd stand, between the people that were loyal to me and my father, a good 43 men strong."
Travis: More than we need. And I grab my earpiece and I go, (meekly) thoughts? (laughter)
Sam: I mean, we have a busy day tomorrow already, I don't know if we should add dragons to it.
Taliesin: We're hunting another dragon.
Sam: Just say yes, we can always leave in the dead of night.
Travis: All right. All this bloodshed is giving me a terrible itch in my ear. We shall stay with you and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a dragon.
Matt: He steps forward to you now, there's a slight limp to his walk, but there's too much pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches out his hands to you and clasps it in his own, Beastmaster-style, holding onto it.
Travis: Yeah, strength and honor!
Matt: "For the dragons, it shall be."
Travis: It shall be.
Matt: He releases the grasp. "Let them walk amongst us as brethren. Come. We have much preparation to do." And he goes back to Worra and limps into her arms, and she takes him up and it's her strength now lifting him on his feet. And the two begin to make their way across the rest of the center of town. All the rest of them take their weapons and they relax, and they still keep a very wary eye of you. The words have been said and there is still this tenuous truce, but they're still coming off the cusp of adrenaline, warfare, and the slaughtering of their previous leader. However, they are going along with the words that were spoken, and there is a look of general fear and respect in their eyes, guarded as it may be. What do you guys want to do?
Liam: I would like to sever the remaining gristle away from his arm that's holding the gauntlet on.
Matt: The gauntlets have been retrieved. And given to Grog, yeah.
Liam: Then I would like to loot Greenbeard's body.
Travis: Could you do me a favor? Could you butcher me a skull of Kevdak, please?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah, yeah. I'm going to land.
Matt: You're going to land, all right.
Laura: And I'm going to call Trinket out.
Matt: Trinket, who's been hiding in the back room there.
Laura: Because things happened so fast for him!
Matt: They did happen.
Laura: And there were really strong people!
Ashley: And I got to go over and heal, yeah. Already healed him.
Sam: I'm going to go over-- are there any remains of the little boy?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Do you have anything that can heal the little boy or bring him back somehow, Pike? Key? Anything?
Marisha: I go and check the little boy. How bad is he? Is he beyond the point of return?
Matt: He's done.
Ashley: Could I--
Sam: Resurrect him or something?
Ashley: I have Raise Dead.
Matt: Do you?
Laura: Does it turn him into a zombie, or does it--
Matt: No, it just raises him from the dead.
Laura: Okay, yeah, do that.
Ashley: Okay. I'll go over to the little boy and see if I can--
Matt: Okay, this will take a while. All right. So, as the rest of herd move on, following Zanror, they begin to separate to gather the rest of the herd throughout the town. A few stay behind, keeping watch--
Marisha: I'll assist Pike in any way that I can.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm going to sit and fix my gun.
Matt: It's going to cost-- 500 gold are consumed by the casting of this spell as part of the--
Laura: I'll help.
Matt: Okay. Takes an hour. So, as you guys take this time, this is a short rest for those of you who aren't part of this ritual. You complete the ritual. Go ahead and make a religion check.
Laura: Hey, you already boxed up your stuff.
Matt: She was like, I'm done, I'm out. Peace.
Ashley: 20?
Matt: d20, add your religion.
Laura: That's good.
Ashley: 24.
Matt: Okay. Vex, you said you wanted to help. What did you want to help with the ritual on?
Marisha: No, I said I wanted to help.
Laura: She was assisting. I was helping with the money.
Matt: Right, sorry, helping with the money. How are you aiding with the ritual?
Marisha: What? How am I aiding with the ritual?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: What were you doing?
Matt: Well, she was casting-- she was preparing the ritual, preparing seals and taking out the components and praying to Sarenrae and speaking the rites, which channel through her in Celestial language. Although she doesn't understand Celestial, she speaks it through as part of the spell, almost like--
Taliesin: I speak Celestial.
Marisha: I also speak-- no, I speak Primordial. I keep getting that confused.
Matt: Yep. How are you aiding in this?
Marisha: Can place my hand on his chest and place my other hand on the ground and try and use natural healing to assist?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and make a straight wisdom roll.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Can I assist?
Matt: How would you like to assist?
Taliesin: I would like to come over and start listening to the chanting that she's doing in Celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it since I can actually speak Celestial.
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance.
Laura: That's lovely.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: All right. As you finish the ritual, both the voices of Pike and Percy begin to harmonize across these various refrains in a language that, especially when spoken in this rhythmic, ritualistic way, it seems to almost create a third voice. And then you hear, clearly, there is a third voice harmonizing with them that you don't know where it's coming from.
Sam: It's me. I'm off here in the corner. (sings scat)
Matt: As the beautiful musical tones of the singing come to a close, your holy symbol, the glow fades, and a moment passes before you hear the soft coughing of the child's throaty expulsion, himself taking in his next breath of air. He sits up, cradling his head. "What happened?"
Marisha: It's okay. I dump a Cure Wounds in him now.
Matt: It's okay! (laughter)
Marisha: Not a potion! I cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Okay, okay.
Taliesin: Take it, take it!
Matt: He's like, (choking sounds).
Laura: I cast Grasping Vine and lift him up by the neck.
Liam: Shot right in the chest.
Taliesin: Six years of Celestial, and when are you ever going to use it? It finally pays off.
Ashley: Thanks for helping, Percy.
Taliesin: That was lovely, thank you.
Matt: All right. So the child is brought back to life, healed, confused, dazed, but not really understanding the circumstances around him, just happy to--
Marisha: He heals 24 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, he's good to go. His wounds close, the dried blood's still there, but he seems to be in perfect health at the moment, although a little weak and worse for wear.
Laura: Where's your mother, child?
Matt: "I don't know."
Laura: Was she here in the square with you?
Matt: "No, everything went by so fast. They tried to pull them out, but they found me and pulled me out and brought me here. That's all. There was a fight and a lot of yelling. That's all I remember."
Ashley: Where do you live?
Matt: "Up by the temples."
Laura: Okay. Well, we'll help you find your family. And maybe while we're there we can see if your grandfather's around.
Matt: He smiles a little bit. You can still see the dried blood streaks across his face, but you can see past that to the smile that peeks through beneath his dirty face.
Laura: I lift him up and put him on Trinket so we can start walking.
Matt: Okay. He laughs and Trinket licks him and takes some of that off and he is excited to be grasping something, although he slides a couple times. You can see he's weak from the remnants of the resurrection spell.
Marisha: I give him a boost.
Matt: Okay. Anybody else doing anything for the short rest?
Travis: I would like to not only remove Kevdak's head, just the upper part, no jaw, just the skull, and I would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the skin around the bear tattoo off.
Laura: Is there anything else to loot off of Kevdak?
Matt: I mean, there is the bloodaxe, there is the--
Laura: Gauntlets?
Matt: The gauntlets, and he has four plus-one enchanted javelins that he did not have an opportunity to use this battle.
Laura: (sings) Bag of Holding!
Liam: I already called Greenbeard.
Travis: I'll take the plus-one javelins. And I'd like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag.
Matt: So mark that, mark down in your refrigerated bag, flayed bear tattoo of Kevdak.
Laura: Flayed bear tattoo. Got it.
Matt: That's disgusting. General leather armor, quarterstaff. You do find one potion of greater healing he did not have the opportunity to try.
Laura: Nice. I'm putting that down.
Matt: That's all he has on him.
Liam: Okay. I'm going to spend the rest of the time that they did that ritual gathering up the bodies, the remains.
Taliesin: I'm going to fix my gun.
Matt: Okay. Make a tinkering check.
Taliesin: Just barely. By one point. Did not break.
Matt: Good. All right.
Liam: I'm going to start a fire--
Matt: There's already a fire going.
Liam: Is it?
Matt: Well, it's slower-burning embers now. One of the barricades that had been set fire by the Fireball earlier.
Liam: I'll stoke it, and then put the bodies on.
Matt: Okay, so you take the bodies of the dead villagers that had been lost in the battle and the handful of the other combatants that had fallen, and you throw them onto the fire and it crackles and burns over time. The smell of burning bodies fills the space around it for a while.
Taliesin: We have a house to procure some items from. And a conversation to have with Zanror at some point.
Sam: What time of day is it now?
Travis: Are there any other goliaths in the square that are lingering?
Matt: There are three lingering that are keeping an eye.
Travis: Can I walk over to one?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: Tonight we prepare for an incredible battle. Go. Release any meager prisoners you may have kept. They will do nothing for our fight.
Matt: "Very well. These two stay, though. No offense, but you did just kill one of my friends naught but an hour ago."
Travis: I did. And your claim is fair.
Taliesin: These two?
Laura: Who's these two?
Matt: There were three Herd members that were keeping an eye--
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: Two of them are goliaths. One of them is human. The human and the other goliath stay behind. The one you talked to walks off and seems to be following through on what you told him to do.
Taliesin: Is it Lord Zanror, by the way? I may request an audience with Lord Zanror at some point. With your supervision.
Travis: Yeah. Have at it.
Matt: Now Thunderlord Zanror.
Travis: Yeah, Thunderlord! I say that in my head.
Sam: We have Pike's dad to find, we've got a house to loot--
Marisha: We've got a child to deliver home.
Matt: Did you want to look over the items you found on Kevdak?
Travis: Oh fucking shit, yes, may I please?
Taliesin: And a unique opportunity to maybe really fuck up a dragon. If we want to be smart.
Matt: There's your bloodaxe. And there's your Titanstone Knuckles.
Laura: (laughs) Bowing down like he's been knighted.
Taliesin: Hm? We have a dragon who's going to go pick up a giant package of whatever we give him.
Laura: Oh shit, you're right.
Taliesin: We could make some interesting decisions on what's in that box.
Marisha: That is an interesting point.
Laura: I mean, do we have to stay in the square, or are we allowed to?
Matt: No. Doesn't seem to be anything holding you there other than the ritual that was done. When the ritual's completed, you're welcome to go about what you're doing. At which point you do see as time has passed, a few people start poking through windows, who apparently were either hiding in some of these buildings, and see you guys and check out and then go back into hiding again. The town still has people living throughout it. Many of them stay hidden whenever things move in their vicinity.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: So.
Sam: What's our thing? Do we want to achieve anything else tonight or just rest?
Laura: I feel like we should return this little boy to his family. And see if we can find your grandpa.
Liam: In the short term, we should be able to walk freely, though.
Matt: All right. So, as you guys gather yourselves, partially rested and breathing a sigh of relief at the not horrible circumstance that nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the gods in a lot of cases.
Laura: I can't believe we're not all dead.
Matt: You make your way northward through Westruun, toward the temple district, small child at your side with the intent--
Laura: On Trinket.
Matt: On Trinket by your side. And possibly to prepare for whatever the Herd has in store for dawn. And with that, we'll finish tonight's game.
Marisha: Now we're going to have to have another huge conversation.
Laura: We didn't die! I seriously thought we were all going to die. When he got healed and everything was running--
Travis: Yup. Yup. I was like, we might as well make it cool, because we're dead.
Liam: We had it, then it flipped and it was gone. And then we snaked it outta the fire.
Marisha: But we had them on the run!
Matt: He, by the way, on that Hold Person, that Cutting Words/Hold Person. Like, that's exactly what that--
Travis: Dude. Yes. Give it up for the fucking bard. Who has an article in Dear Vox Machina.
Sam: Oh yeah, appearing tomorrow.
Matt: Yeah, no. Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.
Marisha: What was that?
Matt: Kevdak hadn't used his action surge yet.
Sam: Action surge? What does that do?
Matt: Multi, it's what he does.
Taliesin: What I do, where he can take an extra action.
Matt: He can do four attacks in one round with the bloodaxe.
Sam: Did he ever get to attack?
Matt: No. Couldn't make his save. His arms were gone by the time he came around.
Laura: Oh my god, getting his arms off him, brilliant.
Matt: Plus, he had four more superiority die and the riposte ability. So he could--
Travis: What is riposte?
Matt: When a creature misses him with a melee attack, he can use one of his superiority die to do a reaction attack as well. So he could in theory get five attacks in one round.
Travis: Oh. Holy shit. That's that half-fighter side, right?
Taliesin: That's sexy.
Matt: Yeah, that Hold Person really changed the dynamic really fast.
Liam: We had a very heated discussion over the earring in that 30 seconds, let me tell you.
Taliesin: Well, we had that whole long walk. That was the theory.
Ashley: I think that was the most stressful game I've ever played.
Laura: This was incredibly stressful.
Sam: Pike almost died, Grog died.
Taliesin: I was about to be toast. Two more hits from that guy and that would've been the end of me.
Travis: That was fucking amazing.
Marisha: That was a three-hour battle. We did nothing but fight.
Matt: And honestly, mucking it up with the archers helped too, because they were all about to start focus-firing on whoever was visible.
Laura: Yeah. So I'm glad we split them up. Getting Grog out.
Matt: Getting Grog out was key. If you hadn't pulled him out and taken all those attacks of opportunity? You would be gone. They weren't going to stop when you hit zero.
Travis: No no, that would've been it.
Matt: They were going to cut you up until you were dead.
Travis: Yeah. Yep.
Liam: Look at that guy.
Matt: What?
Travis: I know, look at the face, you saw it too, didn't you? The shadow of a man that wished he could have butchered somebody and didn't quite get to. (laughter)
Travis: The shadow of Craven Edge lives behind those eyes.
Matt: It's okay. Bunch of dudes. You guys have dragons to deal with.
Laura: Oh god.
Matt: All right, well, guys, thank you very much for watching. Thanks again for Loot Crate for being awesome and being our sponsor--
All: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: If-- I dunno, if he's still around. Is our guest still around?
Laura: Is he?
Sam: No, there's no way.
Travis: Why don't you mention the Loot Crate link again?
Sam: Oh yeah, we should flash up the Loot Crate link and we'll be tweeting that out later.
Matt: Yeah, it's ww (stammers), www.Loot Crate.com/criticalrole.
Sam: So that's five w's?
Taliesin: And the code is "criticalrole", not "critrole".
Matt: They didn't coordinate with Wyrmwood.
Liam: Missed opportunity.
Taliesin: I got Loot Crate for my little brother. It's his nerd of the month club.
Ashley: It's the best. I have Loot Crate and it's the best.
Travis: Yeah, it's a bash. Every time around we're like, aha!
Marisha: I know, it's like a little present to yourself that you forgot you got.
Taliesin: Also, anything I don't want, I put into a big bin and, at Christmas, I am Santa Claus to all the kids on the block. It's intense. They all want to know what's up with me.
Matt: That's fantastic. All right. Well, in the meantime, we'll be back next week to see what this next chapter in the Westruun portion of this adventure holds. Well done, guys. That's the largest battlefield I've made so far.
Sam: That was an amazing battlefield.
Laura: Good job, Matthew Mercer.
Marisha: Thank you, Dwarven Forge!
Matt: Is he-- he's not here? (groans of disappointment)
Matt: Well, we had the pleasure of having Patrick Rothfuss in the office today to watch the game, so wherever you are, Patrick, pleasure to meet you, and maybe we'll drag you--
Ashley: Big fans, big fans.
Matt: Maybe we'll drag you on the show sometime. Next time you're in LA. So, anyway guys, have a wonderful evening, see you next week, and is it Thursday yet? (cheering) [end of transcript]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (cheering)
Kevin: All right! (cheers) Welcome! Is my mic on? It's on, whoa, yeah, welcome to the very first inaugural premiere edition of Critical Role live! Guys, my name's Kevin. I am the social media director for Geek and Sundry-- yes, thank you very much, I am indeed a very cool person. I've been with Geek and Sundry for about eight months now, it was really intimidating at first because I kept mixing up Vax and Vex. Yeah, I still mix up Vax and Vex. But okay, what I was going to say was that Critical Role fans are the warmest, most welcoming fans. (cheering)
Kevin: Yeah! Except for that guy. Right? But no, I love you guys, give yourselves a big hand, thank you so much. (cheering)
Kevin: I want you guys to know, this is our first time doing this, this is as I said the first inaugural premiere, they're all synonyms, right? So if you're like me you're extremely excited. But please remember that all the people at home are still watching, say hi to the people at home, hi people at home.
Audience: Hi!
Kevin: Right? So please do me a favor, put your phones on silent, all right? The house lights are going to be kind of dim, so you can use your phones, you can tweet, you can do social media posts, whatever you want, if there's a Cubone somewhere please let me know, tweet at me. I need like ten Cubones. So yeah, just put everything on silent and be silent about it. You can tweet about the show, please use the hashtag #CriticalRoleLive, surprisingly enough. Do me another favor, don't do the concert pic thing where you put your phone up and record for ten minutes at a time, because there are people behind you, as you may or may not know, so I'd really appreciate that. The other thing is, this not a Rocky Horror thing, so don't shout out like, I would like to rage. Don't do that stuff, don't "how do you want to do this?" Don't do that stuff. Be respectful of the people on stage. Think of this as a funny play. You can laugh, you can woo, but maybe don't shout out suggestions. Especially the suggestions that I know a lot of you have in your heads, right? Wait, I have one other thing. There's a merch thing. The merch table's going to be open after the show, is that right? Yes. After the show, the merch table's going to be open, so if you didn't get a chance to get merch, you're going to get another chance to get merch, so don't worry about that. Is there something else? VIPs will get your posters after, so if you're a VIP, you'll get a poster, just come-- where? Upstairs. Okay. Don't worry. Right. Thank you. Let's hear it for Claudia once again, guys. (cheering)
Kevin: All right, so, do you guys want to bring them out? (cheering)
Kevin: All right. Let's start with the master of dick-lightning and shit-scrying, playing Scanlan Shorthalt, Mr. Sam Riegel! (cheering)
Kevin: All right!
Sam: Thanks! You get a car! You get a car! You get a car!
Kevin: Guys, get your tickets to the gun show, because the gun show's coming to town. Playing Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of Whitestone. Yeah, right, right. Taliesin, let's bring him out, Taliesin Jaffe! (cheering)
Kevin: Guys, put your hands together, put your antlers on your head, for Keyleth. Marisha Ray! (cheering)
Kevin: Is she here? She's so stealthy, I don't understand.
Marisha: I'm an independent woman, all right?
Taliesin: Never mind, I give up.
Kevin: All right, let's bring out the man I have a massive man-crush on--
Sam: I'm already here!
Kevin: Liam O'Brien as Vax'ildan! (cheering)
Liam: What the hell!
Kevin: This next woman was stuffing exotic animals into tiny balls before it was cool. Laura Bailey as Vex'ahlia! (cheering)
Kevin: She's got the hipster glasses to prove it.
Laura: Yeah, that's right. It's not for seeing at all, I don't...
Kevin: And the next guy, the next guy, get out your tubs of mayo for Mr. Travis Willingham as Grog freaking Strongjaw! (cheering and chanting)
Kevin: All right, let's, let's bring it down. Guys, there are certain names that people whisper with reverence. Because those names belong to the breakthrough artists in their field. Jim Henson, Bob Dylan, Madame Curie. (laughter)
Kevin: Tonight we have one of those names with us. You may know him. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Matt Mercer. (cheering)
Matt: Oh boy. That's a lot, that's a lot of people.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Matt: All righty, let me shore up my positioning here on the camera for you fine folks and open my energy drink because that's what makes this show happen.
Travis: Caffeine and drugs.
Matt: (shushing noises) Anyway, welcome everybody to our first Critical Role live, all of you folks there on the internet and everyone here in person in Los Angeles, California. (cheering)
Matt: Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors get together, roll dice, and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we have a fantastic pick-up of last week's story where the adventuring party Vox Machina found themselves wandering through the Feywild. However, before that happens, let us get to our fantastic sponsor for the evening. Once again, this episode is brought to you by Loot Crate, they've been awesome. So thank you guys so much. (cheering)
Matt: The current Loot Crate theme for July is Futuristic, includes a lot of awesome Rick and Morty, Futurama, Mega Man, Valiant Comic stuff, Star Trek, that fun element there. We've got music playing, it's on. Oh man, I feel like things are happening.
Sam: Music's working?
Laura: Music works, you guys, music works.
Matt: There we go. Perfect. Tech stuff is coming together. Yeah, so Futuristic is their crate theme this month. We also have the anime Loot Crate is themed Squadron. Has a bunch of stuff from Gundam, Gate, Arpeggio of Blue Steel, Antimagic Academy, a lot of exclusive stuff, of course you guys can go ahead and get $3 off a subscription by going to lootcrate.com/criticalrole and putting in "criticalrole," one word, in your nice little Loot Crate subscription bonus.
Travis: I chew on Goku's head a lot. I'm a fixated-- it's cool.
Matt: And the paint is actually healthy to eat, apparently. That's not at all the reason why Grog's intelligence is that low. So, if you haven't checked it out yet, check out Loot Crate, thank you guys so much for sponsoring our show, we love you. Great. So. Next up we have-- we recently had a t-shirt contest, didn't we? Laura, if you want to take that away for me.
Laura: Oh, this? Okay, so I get to announce who the official winner is?
Matt: You do, actually, yeah.
Laura: Oh my gosh, this is so exciting. Okay. So the official winner of the first Critter contest is... Against the Chroma Conclave, designed by Antmageddon! (cheering)
Laura: So! As of right now, that shirt is available in the Geek and Sundry store for preorder. It's going to be there for I think two weeks? And it's available in sizes small through 3XL, which we're really excited about. And yeah, so that's that, so.
Travis: Go get one!
Laura: Go you guys for voting on that, you rock, even with shenanigans.
Matt: There were so many amazing contenders for that contest that the community puts out, so we--
Marisha: And we got hacked, which means we made it.
Matt: Yay! Next announcement I have, when I arrived here I discovered that there was an actual PokeGym as a part of this mall, I'd like to ask Team Valor to go ahead and make sure that shit leaves red. (cheering and booing)
Travis: What a response!
Laura: That was a mixed reaction.
Matt: Look, the whole San Fernando Valley's blue, okay, give me something! All right, anyway. Yeah, it's become a thing. And we have another cool announcement. Travis, do you want to take it away on that one?
Travis: Yes we do, the response to this live event was so amazing that we are super stoked to announce that we are going to also be doing Critical Role live in Indianapolis during GenCon on August 6, Saturday night. Tickets will go on sale- I think they're on sale now.
Laura: Right now.
Travis: Right now, so if you want to like, silently on your phone or just ignore it because it's a much bigger venue, so tickets should be available, but we're all going to be in Indianapolis on Saturday night and GenCon to roll some dice with you bitches live. (cheering)
Matt: Hell yeah. So if this wasn't nerve-wracking enough for me, we have another one in a couple of weeks.
Travis: Pressure's on, dude, pressure's on!
Matt: But I'm super stoked, it's going to be my first time at GenCon, I've been wanting to go for many years and this is a nice way to go, I guess. So. Check it out. Hopefully we'll see you guys there. That brings us to the end of our announcements and will bring us down--
Laura: Wait. Before we go into not-regular announcements, should we make sure that people know that we're not having an episode next week because of Comic-Con?
Matt: That's true, actually, yeah.
Sam: Way to bring down the room.
Laura: I'm sorry, guys.
Matt: Because all the company, everyone's going to be at Comic-Con doing panels and scheduling and stuff, there will be no episode next week, but I promise that we'll make the episode the week after that extra cool. (cheering)
Matt: I hope. So yeah, let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Sam: We're on! (cheering)
Matt: All right, all right, we've got to do a story here! It's appreciated, but--
Sam: We should probably just finish.
Matt: All right, so, bringing us in now, back to tonight's episode of Critical Role. Guys, pay attention.
Liam: Illithid syphilis.
Matt: The camera's already on.
Liam: Yeah. Okay.
Matt: So. Our intrepid band of adventurers, Vox Machina, found themselves recently traversing the Feywild in search of another Vestige of Divergence. In doing so, they managed to find an old friend in the nymph Nahla, acquired some information, trading a book, and found their way towards the ever-shifting grasses northward in search of where the Divergence, the object of the Divergence lies. In doing so, they found a new ally, a new friend. A little satyr by the name of, where is it here--
All: Garmelie.
Matt: Garmelie, thank you. Now Garmelie, who had made some really interesting sketches of the party upon being caught was then dragged into Scanlan's magnificent mansion, at which Pike asked him to make a fantastic mural for the interior of that place, which I think still resides there to this day. And on the internet, as we've discovered. Upon traveling further north, hopefully to find their final destination in the form of the Shademirk Bog, where the Fenthras bow seemingly exists, you instead came upon Syngorn, the city from the youthful days of Vex and Vax. Upon speaking to the head-- pardon me; you see, all the nerves gets the belching out. It works out well. Upon encountering Watcher Iova watching the gate, recognizing the twins, let them within the actual city of Syngorn. And that is where we left off. So, as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant city, tall seemingly endless trees around you, many buildings naturally formed and built from smoothly carved stone, various ancient sigils carved throughout the entire cityscape, the very heavy-armored Verdant Guard gathered in places, and a general air of intensity and building military might within the city of Syngorn, you have your invisible companion Garmelie, who at some point in the near future agreed to tell you what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part of the deal that was made by the twins. So. What would you like to do?
Liam: I feel like I should be very stern right now, but I can't stop smiling.
Travis: You're gloomy. Lock it up, here we go.
Laura: I feel like the first thing we need to do is go see our father.
Liam: Right off the bat?
Laura: He's the one that's going to give us access to the rest of the city.
Liam: All right. Is Iova still here, or has she trundled off?
Matt: She's walked off. She literally let you guys in the city and went, do what you've got to do, and then turned away and the rest of the guards--
Laura: Oh seriously, so like... no, no the guard is following us.
Liam: And we remember where we're going, right, because it's all the same as it was.
Matt: The city is the same as it was.
Liam: Well, I imagine we'd go to his home. Our home. His home.
Laura: What time is it? I mean, we don't know what time it is.
Taliesin: It's dusk.
Laura: Thank you, Percy.
Sam: But we just woke up.
Laura: All right. Okay.
Liam: Look at all those elves.
Laura: So many elves.
Travis: Is the little satyr-- is he holding onto my skirts, basically?
Matt: You actually don't feel a general presence, and then as you move you feel a slight tug at your belt.
Travis: Right, so can I like, how far away is that guard that's on our tail?
Matt: About 15, 20 feet back.
Travis: Oh yeah. Can I like super slyly whisper, okay, so at any point are you going to tell us what it is you want us to fucking steal?
Matt: You hear a whispered voice that curls up by your ear, strangely given the fact that he's so small, so the voice is being thrown right into the side of your eardrum, goes, "Just be quiet! Find a place in which we can speak privately, and then I will be happy to tell you. Shh! Stop talking to the air; it upsets them."
Travis: It's really quite normal for me.
Laura: Hey, Grog. You should really watch that gas of yours with him back there.
Travis: Oh, you're so right. Hey, pull my finger. (fart sound)
Matt: (coughs)
Travis: Yeah. That's the family reserve. Oh, he said we're supposed to find somewhere quiet to talk.
Liam: Maybe we should do that first, actually.
Laura: We have guards fucking following us. We have to go find our father.
Taliesin: We also don't know where we're sleeping tonight, or whether or not it's even permissible. We should probably have a conversation with whoever's in charge. Is your father in charge?
Liam: No.
Laura: Ish.
Taliesin: Ish.
Liam: He's a bureaucrat.
Taliesin: Excellent. (laughter)
Liam: All right, let's go see Dad, then.
Marisha: (whispers) Grog.
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) Your pants, they're sagging a little bit, why?
Travis: What?
Marisha: (whispers) They're sagging.
Travis: Oh, it's like the new rage amongst the kids. It gives me super street cred.
Marisha: Where's Garmelie?
Laura: Keyleth, shut up about Garmelie!
Travis: Yeah, ix-nay on the Garmelie-- I think I'm doing Pig Latin wrong. Yeah.
Liam: It's this way. And I start walking off towards Dad's house.
Taliesin: I'm going to follow the twins.
Sam: Sounds good.
Marisha: I look regal and as we pass elves I say, good day.
Matt: The few that look in your direction, Keyleth, take a moment to nod, look you over and then continue walking, seemingly perturbed by the sudden interaction and the immediate realization that you're not of full blood.
Laura: Yeah, sorry Keyleth, your ears aren't large enough.
Marisha: That's not normally what people tell me.
Sam: It's not the size of your ears...
Marisha: That's right.
Matt: So. As you guys continue following Vax'ildan towards the abode of their father, you keep an eye out towards the rest of Syngorn proper. You see the further into the city you go, interspersed with a few Emon guards, you see a handful of individuals that are human, and they're dressed in the actual attire of the guards of Emon, and they're intermingling right now with the Verdant Guard, the military might within Syngorn.
Marisha: What were the name of the guards in Emon? Did they have a name?
Matt: The Emon guard.
Marisha: Yeah, totally.
Matt: There is a name, and it's somewhere in my notes but we're good.
Taliesin: From this perspective, I can see your panic folder. It's so exciting. That's where the magic happens.
Marisha: Yeah, that's true, we never really see that!
Taliesin: This is exciting for us. (laughter)
Matt: So. You guys continue making your way towards the abode. After traversing on the outskirts of what would be the tangleward side of the city, the eastern side, you travel in through an area of buildings that are very beautifully crafted, many of which seem to have stemmed from some sort of a tree growth, but upon closer look you can see that it's actually carved stone to resemble a tree. And then it eventually rises up into a somewhat spherical building, and there are many that build off of that to create this kind of neighborhood of various elven abodes within Syngorn.
Liam: Fucking hate this place.
Laura: Me, too. It's hideous.
Marisha: This is gorgeous. Look at the craftsmanship. It's incredible.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: You make your way towards the end of this particular-- (laughter)
Matt: The guards still keeping track behind you. You find your way to the end of the main road, and it splits into two smaller avenues. You know to take the left that leads deeper into the more political family houses of Syngorn. While your family is not a political house per se, your father, as an ambassador to Emon, was given a home in this location. It is your old home, although it appears to have been even further renovated and is much nicer than you remember, but the door is closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you look upon the outside of this abode you have not seen in many, many years.
Sam: Do you want me to burn it down?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: No, just seriously, you seem super gloomy. Are we getting in a fight?
Laura: No. No fights.
Matt: The guards now step up and flank a little bit, keeping a close eye as you've now approached and effectively knocked on the handle of a relatively middle-to-high-ranking individual within Syngorean society. Eventually the door opens and you see a woman standing there: bright blonde hair, braided and tied up in the back. She's wearing more of a work-gown for the day. You recognize her as Devana, the new wife of Syldor, the one that you had once met before in Emon when you guys came upon your father last time. As the door opens up, she looks out for a second, taking in the whole group that has gathered on the outside of their home and goes, "My god. Vax'ildan, Vex'ahlia, we weren't expecting you!"
Laura: No. I can't imagine you were. Is he here?
Matt: "He is."
Laura: What time is it?
Matt: She glances out, looks up. "That's always a good question. The longer we stay in these realms, the more confused my daughter becomes."
Liam: How long has that been?
Matt: "Weeks now, I assume. Best that our timepieces can keep."
Laura: Is Velora around?
Matt: "She is, would you like to see her?"
Laura: Of course.
Matt: "Come in. Is it just you two?"
Laura: No.
Liam: No.
Laura: It's everyone.
Travis: Hi.
Laura: And Trinket, you remember Trinket.
Matt: (bear noises) Nudges your arm to the side and comes forward and sniffs out to Devana. She shrinks back a little bit and reaches her hand out to the nose and taps the edge of Trinket's face, and Trinket licks her fingers.
Marisha: Good day.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. They respond better if you say "good day" and if you have your head up.
Travis: If we say "bidet?"
Marisha: Bidet, yes. Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Taliesin: So close. So very close.
Matt: The two guards closest to you, within their helmets their eyes narrow, they look at each other and shake their heads.
Travis: Oh, bidet.
Liam: Your accent is perfect. Don't change a thing.
Matt: Devana goes, "Very well. If you would all proceed to be quiet if you could, Syldor is working. And you may stay outside," she says to the guards. And they both, "We were given orders, milady, to--" "I understand that. But this is already a lot of people in our home. Stay close within earshot, it'll be fine. I trust them." The guards, (sighs)
Laura: I wink at them as I walk inside.
Matt: No reaction whatsoever. You guys make your way into the home and are immediately caught with a very strong smell of cedar. It's a very pleasant-smelling home, and the hearth is warm. It's everything you wanted your home to be, and it immediately hits you to walk in here and see this kind of life away from a life, seeing elements of it that remind you of your childhood, things about it that flag memories to your head of good times and bad, in just a few mere moments. And at that same time, there's a sadness because so much of it has changed, so much of it seems better than the memory. And for a moment there, you feel a little tinge of wondering how different it might've been. At which point that thought process is broken as Devana steps in and goes, "Would anyone like tea, perhaps?"
Sam: Sure, yes, do you have an oolong?
Marisha: Maybe a chamomile, it would be great.
Matt: "Something like that, yes. It's been a little scarce in the Feywilds. More difficult to farm herbs here than you'd think."
Marisha: Oh, here. I pull out some herbs that I brought from my garden. Some glisfoil and other things.
Matt: "Thank you. Appreciate that."
Marisha: They won't scream at you when you pick them. Good. It's good.
Matt: "Thank you. What was your name again?"
Marisha: Oh, I'm Keyleth of the Ashari.
Matt: "A pleasure to meet you again--"
Marisha: Good day.
Matt: "That's, that's really not necessary in my home. You, sir, your name?"
Taliesin: Whatever's available would be just fine.
Sam: I think she means your name.
Marisha: I think she means your name.
Matt: "That's a curious title."
Marisha: But you can call him whatever's available, as well.
Matt: "Very well, coffee table. What's your name?" (laughter)
Liam: It's easier than the actual name.
Taliesin: For you, it is just Percival, and I am another visiting royal from man's world.
Matt: "All right. You, sir?"
Sam: I am called the Kingslayer, Chuck Norris, Burt Reynolds. I have many names. You see, when you've traveled a road as long as I have--
Matt: "Black tea, got it. And you, sir, the large one?"
Travis: Oh, yeah. Bidet. The name is Grog.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return with Syldor once he knows you're here. It may be a while if you don't mind waiting, but the tea will come out posthaste."
Laura: And Velora? Where's she?
Matt: "Let me get her for you, she'll be very like to see both of you, she asks from time to time." She brushes a little lock of hair that's fallen in front of her face behind her ear, and smiles and darts off towards the kitchen. A few moments pass with you guys sitting in awkward silence, looking about the space in the vicinity. Looks to the twins. Eventually Devana comes out and sets tea for all of you across the central table in this meeting area, and behind her you see, clutching the edge of the skirt, you see this tiny, long brown hair that is braided, but the braid's coming undone, tomboyish looking elven girl that peeks around the side of her dress and hides again behind the back. [high-pitched noise]
Matt: Welcome back, sorry about that. (cheering)
Sam: What a battle!
Matt: The technical aspects. We're working through it, but we got through it, thank you for your patience. So the last few minutes, we're not quite sure how much you guys may have missed, but the party wiped. We're rolling up new characters. No, for the Monday episode we'll go ahead and make sure to splice in anything that may have been missed for the past minute. But the party had come to the home of Syldor, the father of Vax and Vex. They had a brief discussion with Devana, his new wife. They were given tea after introductions and then briefly discussed the merits of being a warrior with their half-sister Velora Vessar, and upon discussing apparently a war of some kind, Syldor made his way into the room, and you look and you see the long dark hair of Syldor, his pale complexion, his stern face, staring back at you all from within the doorway as he closes it behind him and steps into the room. You see Devana sits up now and comes over to him and says, "My dear, would you like us to leave you alone?" He goes, "Don't worry, it will be fine. Have a seat. Besides, we're all family. Well, some of us, at least." And he looks over to Grog.
Travis: Bidet. (laughter)
Matt: "Good day, indeed." He comes up and sits, and he's wearing long, dark brown robes with golden and red embroidery on the side, but it's very casual home wear, and he sits down, pulling up a chair across from you guys in this area, and takes one of the cups of tea and sips it. And you can see there's an intensity to his face. He's here, and he looks like he's partially inconvenienced by your presence like he always did, but he also looks like he hasn't slept well, there's some dark circles under his eyes and he seems a little distracted for such a climactic re-meeting.
Laura: Surprise!
Matt: "Surprise, indeed. So. It's good to see you both. Glad you're in good health. You've come quite a ways to come speak with me, being as we currently reside within the Feywild."
Liam: It's a little bit further than we thought we'd have to travel, why... the presence around the city we're seeing? We understand why you fled, but what's going on?
Matt: "Look. We had the entire Fort Daxio army down here and we were to give aid to push into the nearby mountain range where apparently there was an influx of lizardfolk, had been a continuous problem, and apparently a break had been seen somewhere. However, we had sent most of our forces into the mountain range and then received word that three great drakes were making their way straight toward Syngorn after the destruction of Emon. Knowing that, we had no recourse but to flee and prepare when it was time. Had we stood our ground, we would be the same burning crater that your fair city is now."
Laura: So you intend to go back? You're amassing this army to go back and join the fight.
Matt: "That is exactly what we're doing. The remnants of the Emon army we currently have here in the city, we've been building armor and weapons to make sure the most sure-footed and strong-of-arm men and women of our fair city can make it to that battlefield and tear that beast down."
Laura: That's wonderful news.
Matt: "Good. Why are you here?"
Taliesin: We are here on a very similar range of business, to be honest.
Matt: "And you are?"
Taliesin: Ah, yes. Percival Fredrickstein von Mussel Klossowski de Rolo III of the royal house of Whitestone, representative of man's world, here on very important business dealing with dragons. We are looking for some objects: a few things that may help us in our fight against these dragons that have attacked us. We've already made headway against them, and we've already made headway on our quest to destroy them. Any help that your wonderful city could provide would be most agreeable.
Matt: "Well. We currently have all of our resources engaged in our plans of attack. There is not much we could offer you other than, if you wish to stay here within the city, we could provide a place to sleep, food, and when the time is right you may join our ranks into the fray."
Liam: We've come to the Feywild for something specific.
Marisha: We're trying to head to the Shademirk Bog.
Matt: "Why on earth would you be heading to the Shademirk?"
Marisha: We're looking for the bow of Fenthras. It supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree.
Matt: "Right. Well. Good luck with that."
Laura: Do you think it's possible?
Matt: "I think it's a fool's errand to chase a fleeting rumor into a location that is known to devour and destroy anyone who steps within its bounds. But by all means, you've always been ones seeking the darkness."
Liam: He and I are wearing fleeting rumors. That one's got one hidden up his butt. (laughter)
Matt: You hear Velora chuckle. Devana's like, "Shh! Quiet!"
Laura: I want to pull Velora over and sit her in my lap.
Matt: She (raspberry noise) at her mom as you pick her up there. You can see Devana smiles as she does so.
Liam: Syldor, we have killed two of these dragons already. Nothing could please me more to hear that you are amassing forces here to go back; that is possibly the greatest thing I've ever heard you say to me.
Laura: I want to insight check him and see if he's really saying--
Travis: Yeah, do that shit!
Matt: Roll an insight check.
Liam: Him or me?
Laura: 26 on him!
Matt: All right. I'd whisper, but the microphone makes it useless. It's fine. He appears tired, he appears like a lot of his intention and time has been put towards something important--
Laura: Being a giant dick?
Matt: Possibly. But he doesn't appear to be lying or fudging the truth at all, he's just tired. He says, "Look. There are a lot of pieces at work here. If you have your own path, by all means. And while I have heard of some of your exploits, and I am quite impressed, I hate to be blunt, but it's difficult and strange to mingle family new and old. Your presence here brings up difficult memories for me."
Laura: Oh, you poor man.
Liam: Don't worry. We're not here to look for family. That would entail some amount of investment on either our side or yours. There is clearly none. We are here to do business. Do you know where the bog is?
Matt: "Yes. It's duskward of here."
Sam: Duskward.
Travis: Fucking shit.
Liam: Well, some people go this way, and some people go that way, and some people go both ways.
Marisha: It's like being on a ship forever.
Matt: "I have not traversed this land extensively. I've been here working along with the heads of the city to make sure we are ready for this attack."
Laura: When do you plan to attack?
Matt: "A few weeks."
Laura: You're joining other armies. You don't plan to fight Thordak on your own?
Matt: "Well. There is an attempt to join up with the remnants of the Fort Daxio force. They have not gone to Emon themselves and they currently reside camped out near where Syngorn usually is. We have a few groups that are set on the other side of the veil in the prime realm and they are keeping an eye out for this. A few scouting parties are in Emon as we speak, trying to gather intel on Thordak himself. Once we have that information and we can formulate what to expect, then we can attack."
Marisha: So you're trying to go after Thordak himself. That's your first target, Thordak?
Matt: "He's currently the largest threat to our safety, our home, and our return. Don't think this is the first time a red dragon of that size has been felled. There have been ancient ages of various deaths from his people. It's not impossible, but we need to be ready."
Travis: Just a heads-up, pro tip  dragons can fly. (laughter)
Matt: "And I take it you're their leader."
Travis: Of the dragons? (laughter)
Matt: He very slowly sighs while grabbing his tea.
Travis: I've clearly lost your father. It's all right.
Laura: His intelligence is very low, Grog.
Taliesin: In the interest of dealing with Thordak, we are going to need access to libraries, any of your people who may know something about this bog, and accommodations befitting those of us who are titled.
Sam: As well as access to certain parts of the city. We need some items to acquire within the city before we set out.
Marisha: Also, it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled.
Sam: And I had asked for an oolong tea. (laughter)
Sam: This is more of an assam, I would say? A black tea.
Taliesin: This is technically what you do, though, isn't it?
Matt: Devana says, "I'm terribly sorry, I didn't mean that--"
Marisha: No, not you.
Matt: Syldor crosses his fingers together and, "I can give you a letter that will grant you entry to a few of our general storehouses. However, most of you are outsiders and others have been ostracized in their own right."
Taliesin: But you will respect titled entry. Those of us who are court can converse with court.
Matt: "Your title, your court, is unfamiliar with me. I doubt it will hold sway within this town, this city, this entire realm. But you speak of great importance, are you the leader of this troop, he who brings up words of courts and titles?"
Taliesin: For the moment, why not? I will say, I know the Feywild by reputation, and by reputation you are known for your manners, and any kingdom should be measured by manners as the currency that is the easiest to come across.
Matt: "Manners, by the way, are extremely effective in times of peace. This is not one of those times. However, I appreciate that you at least acknowledge the way things sometimes work. So. Daughter. Son. What else do you need of me?"
Liam: Honestly? Nothing.
Laura: We don't need or want anything from you.
Matt: "Yet you still came to my home."
Laura: Oh, well. Yeah. We got what we wanted, which is access to the city.
Liam: We're not here to be friends or rekindle anything, but it seems like we want the same thing, in a roundabout way. We want to end these dragons. We want to return the world to what it once was. Any help you can give in spite of our past, in spite of all the bullshit between us will be appreciated by more than just she and I.
Laura: We know you have no love for us. Think of those you do love. And I hug Velora. Don't you want to make her safe?
Matt: "That's exactly what I intend to do. If you wish to help in that, then so be it. I'll pull what I can within the city. (sighs) Just leave me to my business, please." You see for a moment there, for all the facade, all the front that he puts up, that strong distance facade, you see the fatigue break through, and there's a, like a dark heartbreak. "This is a greater threat than we've ever faced in our lifetime, and many of those in this city have lived quite a while. We have to do things right. Don't be foolish. Too many lives have been lost at the hands of these dragons, some closer than others."
Laura: Do you know of anyone that has traversed more of the Feywild, that would know of what we might expect?
Matt: "One who's seen the most would be the High Warden. I could probably get you passage to see her, but you're going to be heavily guarded." You guys do know the High Warden, Tyrelda is her name, and she is actually of the bloodline of Gynlara who founded Syngorn centuries ago. She currently is essentially the de facto leader, though in terms of public, she is the final decision-maker on most of Syngorn's political and social endeavors. "Will that suffice?"
Liam: It will.
Laura: It will.
Sam: Good day.
Marisha: Good day. (laughter)
Matt: "Curious manners, your friends." He takes his tea and pours another cupful, and leans back in his chair. "Two dragons you say you've killed."
Liam: That's right.
Laura: More than that, isn't it?
Travis: Of the Conclave.
Laura: Of the Conclave, we've killed two.
Matt: "Which ones?"
Laura: Umbrasyl. And. What was the other one?
Liam: Blitzen?
Laura: Blitzen, Donner? What was the name of the other one? Oh, it was General Krieg!
Marisha: Yeah, that one.
Laura: The blue one.
Marisha: And then we've also killed a white one.
Sam: We thought so little of him we didn't even remember his name. (laughter)
Liam: Brimscythe?
Marisha: Brimscythe. That's the one.
Sam: But also we respect him enough to learn his name.
Matt: "Well, your story has charm. I have to admit, I have gotten word of at least one dragon felled on the other side."
Marisha: I pull out a dragon's tooth from Umbrasyl out of my pocket and I toss it to him. That's the result of the doings of your children. You should be very proud.
Matt: "I am proud. I. Am proud. But the city lives differently. Understand the difficulty that your presence puts upon our family with you being here. I mean no disrespect, and it's fine in this trying time. But while you two may have undergone much ridicule in your youth, I saved you from the brunt of it."
Laura: You-- headphones, dear-- you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through, and you expect us to feel sorry for you?
Liam: You should've left us to be with our mother when she died!
Laura: Why? Why pull us away from her if you had no love? We would have been happy with her.
Matt: "Because I had hope that you would be worth more, given that you had my blood in your veins, than to waste away in some small hovel."
Laura: If I could pull the blood of you from my veins and give it back, I would. I want no part of you.
Matt: "There are many things we wish for but we have no choice but to take what we are given and make the best with what we have. Even with this rift, there is still a part of me that cares for you both and is genuinely happy that you live. And that you rise. And that you prove what the rest of these fools in this city said you were incapable of. Yes, I am prejudiced. But I still fight it every day. And I'm not going to lie, every time that my daughter, your half-sister, laughs and plays stealthy Vax and Vex on her own, it makes me smile. You inspire those outside of our city walls with your doings. I think that's rather large of you. As foolish and as damned deadly as some of these endeavors may be, you inspire. That's more than I've done in my lifetime. So. Care not what I think. Care not how your mother died. Just avenge it. For both of us. Show your little sister that you can rise up and destroy whatever comes in your way. Hate me all you want. It's only half-scorn from me. I live with my regrets. I tried to bring you up right. But that upbringing was not right for you. And by the time I tried to return you, it was too late. I'm sorry. That's all I can say." Devana goes, "Anyone want any more tea? Oolong, you said."
Sam: You got it!
Matt: "Right, yes." And she leaves, awkwardly.
Travis: Just so you know, what they did against the dragons was incredible. All of the rest of us were like, "Ah! Oh, we're dying! We don't have anything we can do!" And then they were like "Kill! Stab!" And then--
Marisha: Percy! No, don't die!
Taliesin: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm being blood out of your jugular, just go with it.
Travis: And then they killed them all! It's the only reason we're alive, really.
Sam: It's true. Vax wanted to go inside the dragon, I was like, no! No, let's do it! (laughter)
Sam: Cut his way out, went back and saved me. Crazy.
Matt: "That does indeed sound quite crazy."
Travis: I mean, the balls on this one-- this one.
Matt: "Let's be honest, Grog. They both have--"
Travis: Lord Grog Peanut Butter of Strongjaw. I'm titled.
Matt: "I'd say they've both proven to have more balls than most of those in our city."
Liam: Look, we're never going to be a happy family.
Matt: "No. That is right."
Liam: But if you want to make reparations, help us on our path. It will only help you on yours.
Matt: He stands up from his chair and walks his way back to his study and closes the door behind him.
Laura: Well, fuck. Guess he's not into us now.
Travis: I thought we weren't getting in a fight!
Taliesin: No, this is good.
Sam: Do you want me to take a dump somewhere?
Taliesin: Not yet.
Laura: Oh, headphones, darling.
Sam: Oh, sorry.
Matt: She pulls your hand down, looks at you, says, "Take a dump!"
Laura: Oh, shit. I mean, shoot!
Matt: "I like him."
Sam: That's gnomish. Doesn't mean the same thing.
Matt: She's now transfixed on Scanlan.
Laura: Darling, he takes blue sparkly poos!
Matt: "Blue sparkle poos? Can you teach me?" (laughter)
Sam: Do you have any blueberries?
Matt: "I'm going to ask my mom if we've got blueberries."
Travis: Holy shit.
Matt: She runs off to the kitchen. A few minutes pass, and Devana comes out holding the tea on the cart and goes, "Who taught my daughter to say 'blue sparkly poo?'"
Laura: I don't know what you're talking about.
Marisha: Is that a swear word?
Laura: You should really control the people in this city from talking about that, because it's weird.
Sam: She got it at preschool.
Taliesin: So many soldiers everywhere.
Matt: "Velora, go to your room."
Marisha: I've never heard a soldier say, "Ah, blue sparkly poo!" I feel like she didn't get that from a soldier.
Taliesin: You've never really been in war, have you?
Matt: The door opens from the far study, and you see Syldor walk back in holding what looks to be a rolled-up piece of paper with a seal on it. He heads over and tosses it onto the table. "That will grant you passage through the city. That will grant you a single meeting with the High Warden. That's the most my power can do at this time."
Laura: This is a belt buckle, why are you passing me this?
Liam: (stage-whispering) We're playing pretend.
Laura: Okay, oh, it's a sealed scroll now.
Taliesin: May I see that really quickly? Don't throw it! Pretend!
Marisha: Pretend. I'm pretend handing it off.
Sam: Ooh, good object work.
Liam: Now get in the canoe!
Laura: Yes, yes.
Taliesin: Right, they're all elves. I can't look at them.
Sam: Oh, it flew away!
Taliesin: This grants an audience for all of us, then?
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: You're going to have to amend that one name, though, just to be fair. It's Lady Vex'ahlia.
Matt: "Lady?"
Taliesin: Lady Vex'ahlia, Baroness of the Third House of Whitestone and Grand Mistress of the Grey Hunt. (cheering)
Taliesin: So good sir, despite your relationship with her, do watch your manners.
Sam: Tea spit take!
Matt: "My apologies, Lady Vex'ahlia."
Laura: Well, you didn't know. (laughter)
Matt: You can see, there's confused surprise, but a smile does curl across the corner of his mouth. "I will make the amendment immediately." And he stands back up, takes it from Percival and makes his way back to the room.
Liam: Darth Vader.
Matt: He returns, hands you the amended paper. "Good luck."
Laura: This is a belt buckle-- oh. (laughter)
Matt: It's a gift from your mother.
Travis: You should thank Percy.
Matt: "If you do intend to make your way towards the Shademirk, be careful. Be safe. And if anything comes your way that you feel you are incapable of handling, run. We don't need heroes right now, we need survivors."
Travis: No promises?
Matt: He shoots you a very dark look.
Travis: Right. Sorry. The House of Peanut Butter will continue its bloodline. I don't know.
Matt: "I will send word. Where can I send word to retrieve you when the time is ready for us to attack?"
Sam: Do we have accommodations in the city?
Laura: Yes, but we'll be in Whitestone.
Matt: "I will send word to Whitestone when we plan to return to the Prime Material, and preparing our forces for attack upon Thordak in Emon."
Marisha: If not, reach out to Allura of Emon.
Matt: "I know Allura well, and I can reach to her."
Marisha: I had a feeling you did. (laughter)
Sam: Are you hitting on their dad?
Matt: "Anyway."
Marisha: Does everything look like hitting on people to you, Scanlan?
Sam: It does.
Matt: It's the Scanlan filter. It's on Snapchat.
Marisha: Take off the beer goggles, take them off! Those are plus-two magical beer goggles. Take them off!
Matt: He stands up and at this point Devana enters beside him, puts her hand on his shoulder. He looks to you with his hands crossed before him and goes, "I wish you luck and safe journeys. I appreciate you coming by. It was good to see you both."
Liam: Where did our sister go?
Matt: Turns and Devana goes, "She's in her room for using bad language."
Laura: Poo is a really terrible word to say, I think. Good thing she didn't say any of the other words that she heard in here.
Matt: "Hold on." And she leaves and comes back, this time pushing Velora from the back, and Velora walks up pouting with her arms crossed, holding her little owlbear under her arm.
Liam: Come here.
Matt: She runs up and gives you a big hug. "Are you leaving?"
Liam: Yeah, just for a little bit, though.
Matt: "You just got here!"
Liam: I know. Listen, do me a favor? Keep scraping up those knees, will you? You crawl anywhere you want in this city, the higher the better. And listen to your parents some of the time. But not all of the time.
Matt: "I can already do that."
Laura: Oh, and!
Matt: She gives you a little kiss on the cheek and then runs up and puts her arms around you and almost pushes you back, she's bigger than you remember.
Laura: She is. I pull out one of my owlbear feathers that I picked up with Zahra and I tuck it behind her ear.
Matt: "What's this?"
Laura: It's an owlbear feather. I know! (laughter)
Matt: She steps back down and looks at her little plushie and--
Laura: You keep that behind your ear, and you wear your necklace, and you never forget that Vex and Vax love you very, very much, dear.
Liam: Listen to us. You are not our half-sister. You are our sister.
Matt: She runs up and hugs you both, one in each arm, and then steps back down. "Thank you. Come back soon, please!"
Laura: Of course, come visit me in my baroness... isity.
Matt: She runs back to her mom's side and looks at her mom and goes, "Poo." (laughter)
Matt: Devana rolls her eyes and goes, "Ugh. Thank you. So much."
Liam: Shit's a good word, too.
Matt: Covers her ears.
Travis: Are we doing that now? Penis wiggle! (laughter)
Matt: You see Devana's looking cornered, it's like, (shushing noises). Syldor actually starts laughing. "I hope that's good day, then!"
Sam: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Travis: Bidet.
Marisha: Good day.
Taliesin: Good day.
Matt: "Good day." And Syldor bows, you all slowly leave the door, and right before the door closes behind you hear a little voice go, "Shit." (laughter)
Matt: "No!" The door closes.
Marisha: We're those terrible-influence side of the family, aren't we?
Laura: I run up and I give Percy the biggest hug. Percival!
Taliesin: It's the gift of smugness, it never goes away.
Laura: Wait, is it real-- no. Was it all just to--
Taliesin: No, I actually, it occurs to me that we did kill two of the three barons of Whitestone the last time that we were there. (laughter)
Taliesin: There's no house and there's no money--
Marisha: It's the one Scanlan burned.
Taliesin: It's the one that Scanlan burned.
Sam: Oh, you're the lady of the house that I burned down.
Taliesin: And there's just a crypt and that's being used for other things, but--
Marisha: But you have a title!
Taliesin: But you do have a title, at the very least. And once a year, you have to do something ridiculous.
Laura: Even so, Percy.
Taliesin: You're welcome.
Laura: I thank you so much.
Taliesin: Use it in good health.
Travis: I lean over to Scanlan and I say, did you notice that their dad was saying "bidet" wrong?
Sam: I did. I did.
Travis: I thought he was like a highfalutin type.
Sam: You should just say it even louder to make sure people know the correct pronunciation.
Travis: I know. We could be a force for good in and outside of the city. Bidet!
Sam: Bidet!
Matt: The guards that are waiting for you outside of the house just sigh very loudly. (sighs)
Travis: Change is hard.
Matt: All right, so you have your parchment. Within the next half-hour or so it's not difficult for you guys to go ahead and find sleeping arrangements for the evening within Syngorn. You're met for the most part with standoffishness and curiosity with your approach, but upon showing the paper there is a sudden realization and a formality that is brought to the conversation, and it's, you can't help but enjoy it, the two of you. You haven't walked through Syngorn and been forcing people to show you the respect you've always wanted, and there is something slightly cathartic about that. But you manage to find accommodations for the evening's rest. The guards proceed up into the secondary floor where your room is kept. Will not enter the room, but notify you that they will be staying outside of the doorway to ensure that both you are protected and that you don't do anything crazy in the night.
Travis: What?
Laura: That's stupid.
Marisha: We're respectable.
Taliesin: It's adorable that they think they could stop us if we tried.
Marisha: I know! Are we all in rooms next to each other, are we in one room?
Matt: It's a series of rooms within what looks like it was at one time a military barracks that has since been renovated. It's not really an inn or tavern; there aren't a lot of travelers that come through Syngorn that don't actually live there or have a home, so it's more being used for storage, but they cleared out an area and they put up beds and it looks-- Syngorn storage room is pretty nice by the standards of like Kymal or Westruun, so it's not too bad.
Taliesin: There's some art nouveau happening. That's all I can really ask.
Marisha: Have they already locked us in our rooms?
Matt: No, you've just gotten to your rooms now, so.
Travis: We're a very religious group and we like to have a family prayer.
Laura: Speaking of, wait. Where the fuck is Pike?
Sam: Oh shit.
Marisha: She was right behind us!
Matt: You all, you all realize in the chaos and the tension of meeting your father--
Liam: Must've gotten lost!
Travis: No, she's here.
Matt: You catch a sudden flicker of divine energy in the space of the hallway near you. The guards step back, looking a bit freaked out and grabbing their weaponry, and you see a burst of Pike's face coming through, her divine form, and she says, "I'm sorry--" (static) Disappears, comes back. "The walls--can't maintain--" And her form vanishes once again.
Travis: Fucking Verizon. (laughter)
Laura: Great, now we'll never have them as a sponsor. Thank you, Travis.
Liam: Go T-Mobile.
Matt: Go AT-- No.
Marisha: So can we have like a little family pow-wow in maybe one of the rooms before we all tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we don't sneak into each other's rooms. High school field trip, yeah?
Sam: I don't know any of those words.
Matt: "Do as you wish, we'll be here if you need us."
Travis: Do you need anything, drinks?
Sam: We need to talk to the little fucker.
Travis: Then-- oh, what? Oh, yeah! Well, let's all head inside for prayer.
Laura: Actually--
Taliesin: We'll need food and drink.
Laura: Guard! One of you, could you go get us some food? We're very hungry.
Marisha: And wine? Maybe some wine?
Laura: As a baroness, I'm very used to getting food when I want it.
Matt: One of the guards steps forward and says, "Let me see that parchment once more, please?"
Travis: That's not it.
Matt: That's a belt buckle. (laughter)
Liam: My belt buckle!
Matt: Rolls it back up, hands it back. "I will retrieve your necessary meal, drink, and other requests you may have."
Liam: Chicken, please.
Laura: Thank you. I want anything but chicken.
Matt: "Noted and noted." And he turns around and leaves the three other guards standing outside of your rooms to do about as you please.
Sam: Right, so we pick the biggest room and we all enter it.
Matt: It's a two-bedroom, opposite sides, and there is a window that has a beautiful view of the central lake that sits at the center of Syngorn, the entire city's built around, before it meets the base of the mountain range that it's buttressed against.
Sam: Titicaca.
Matt: That sounds Elvish, but it's not.
Sam: No, I just like saying that.
Matt: Door closes behind you guys.
Travis: Gormidi?
Matt: There's a little flash, a sparkle of arcane light as the satyr form goes, (breathes heavily) "That was a little harrowing. You didn't tell me you were going to bring me into the belly of the beast so soon, we didn't even talk about-- that was really good tea, by the way; that was quite delicious."
Taliesin: You were drinking our tea?
Matt: "Very quietly."
Marisha: I was wondering where my tea went.
Travis: Now, hold on. Did you steal anything while you were in there?
Matt: "No!"
Marisha: Garmelie...
Matt: "No!"
Sam: Insight-check him.
Travis: Insight-check that bitch!
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: He is about as hard to read as anyone you've come across in the Feywild.
Marisha: Can I try?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: I feel like we don't need an insight check to know he was lying.
Marisha: Oh, I got a 17. I'm way more better than Scanlan. Natural insight. 28.
Matt: 28. Through his teeth.
Marisha: I do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets, TSA style. Start giving him the frisk.
Matt: These vines wrap up around his legs and he's like, "Oh, I was just!"
Marisha: Into the pockets.
Travis: Just let it happen.
Laura: Where are the pockets?
Matt: In his vest.
Marisha: In his vest pockets.
Taliesin: There better not be an owlbear in there or I'm going to be very upset.
Matt: No, you reach into one pocket, it's empty. You reach into the other, and your arm goes quite far into the pocket, farther than it should--
Marisha: You little devil.
Matt: "What? This is extremely degrading! We had a deal." It's empty.
Marisha: Is this a pocket of holding? I think about the fancy silverware that I might've seen in Syldor's house.
Matt: Nothing. Just an empty space.
Travis: Come on, keep going.
Marisha: I think of fancy teacups, because he mentioned drinking tea.
Matt: (melodically) Nothing!
Marisha: Goddamn it.
Travis: You've never stolen anything, shit!
Laura: Think of gold. Think of gold, Keyleth.
Taliesin: I cast Friends.
Marisha: I think of gold? Oh, I think of gold. Sorry, I'm not materialistic.
Taliesin: We're going to have to have a working relationship.
Laura: Why do you say that like it was a bad thing?
Marisha: I mean, I'm not. I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie world. (laughter)
Matt: He smacks the side of your arm and is like, "Get your hand out of my pocket!"
Marisha: Ow!
Liam: Keyleth. Check the fur.
Laura: No, don't check the fur.
Matt: "Excuse me?!"
Taliesin: Let's give him a chance to 'fess up.
Matt: "This is not why we're here to talk. We are here to discuss the elements of our agreement. Two things I require your aid in taking, and then I show you to the outskirts of the Shademirk."
Laura: I feel like now we already know where the outskirts of the Shademirk are.
Matt: "But do you know of the dangers that are on your way?"
Sam: Yeah, you told us about all three dangers that we have to face.
Marisha: That's true. I have them written down. (laughter)
Marisha: The Hut of Wodenna, the Last Camp of Sorudun the Happy, and the theatre.
Matt: "And you think those are all the dangers?! There are so many! It's a dangerous place! Stop touching me!"
Travis: All right, hands off him.
Sam: Just tell us what the two things are we that we need to steal.
Matt: "All right. I require a piece of a threshold crest."
Laura: What the fuck is that?
Marisha: Of a threshold crest?
Liam: Giant stones on the outside of the city.
Matt: "Threshold crest." Which you recall are the blue stones that are in the wall around the city.
Laura: That's the stupidest thing.
Marisha: Oh no!
Matt: "Why is that stupid?"
Laura: Because then they can't go back!
Matt: "You don't have to get it from the wall. I'm sure they build it from something and there might be a reserve somewhere."
Marisha: Right, in the other dimension that they came from. You realize Syngorn didn't originate here in the Feywild, right?
Matt: "I understand, but just..."
Marisha: Oh, lord have-- oh, sweet Sarenrae.
Taliesin: Wait, okay, a threshold-- a piece?
Matt: "A piece of a threshold crest. Just but a sliver."
Liam: The same material?
Matt: "The same material enchanted that is functionally able to be utilized in the same fashion."
Travis: No problem. What else?
Matt: "Great. I also want the High Warden Tyrelda's hat."
Travis: Her hat?
Laura: Do we know what her hat looks like?
Matt: You do, actually.
Laura: What does it look like?
Matt: It's a pointed, small tricorn made of green velvet that she wears when she goes on like excursions outside of the city.
Marisha: Oh my god, she's got a pirate tri-corner hat?
Matt: It's small and very long. Imagine a pirate hat with a little more of an elven sleekness to it.
Laura: Wait, like a Robin Hood hat? Like Peter Pan!
Marisha: Oh my god, like Peter Pan!
Matt: Sure, yeah!
Liam: I wasn't looking forward to this moment, but that actually sounds like fun.
Laura: That's it, that's all you need?
Matt: "That's all! And I will fulfill my side of the deal."
Marisha: I have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest, but why would you want the High Warden's hat?
Matt: "Because I have my reasons."
Taliesin: So. Are you going to give us what you stole now? We have an arrangement.
Matt: "We do have an arrangement."
Taliesin: It's only fair. Come on.
Matt: Reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks to be a very finely sculpted bronze statue of Syldor that was gifted for essentially his work with Emon and establishing better trade routes between that city and this city. It's basically a good job, salesman of the year award of Syldor's.
Marisha: They stole his Emmy?
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Laura: No, it's like they stole his gold watch.
Liam: I yoink it out of his hand. I'll take that. I got it right here.
Sam: It's a belt buckle.
Liam: Right on my belt.
Travis: So weird, you pickpocketed the thing that wasn't even expensive.
Laura: Why did you take that?
Sam: He can't help it, he's a klepto.
Matt: "No! It was there and nobody was looking."
Marisha: Because it ultimately doesn't matter. You know how awards work. Come on.
Matt: "Regardless, we have business to tend to. Come, we have a hat to catch!"
Liam: Oh, you want to come along?
Marisha: Oh, hang on, before we all leave. Vex and Vax, what did your dad do back in the day? Because he knows Allura and he talked about knowing Thordak.
Laura: He's an ambassador to the city.
Marisha: Does he have any type of fighting capabilities?
Laura: Ugh. If he does, we never saw it.
Liam: Yeah, he'll bore you to death.
Laura: Yeah, he can talk a lot.
Marisha: Because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in Thordak 11 or so years ago.
Laura: What? No way.
Marisha: He mentioned that he's been down this road before.
Laura: He knows Allura because he knew the Council members. He was the one that sent us off to find...
Liam: He's a traveling salesman that sells politics. He's not anything all that fancy.
Marisha: Well, if he sells politics, there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon. I'm not trying to be a dick, but your father was kind of a dick so I'm just questioning it.
Laura: No, he's an asshole. That's totally fine.
Marisha: I'm not trying to talk shit about your family.
Laura: No, feel free.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: Y'all should totally fight right now. Just fight in the room while we're all here and take off your clothes.
Marisha: I'm just saying.
Travis: Only way to solve it.
Laura: Totally, totally.
Travis: Yep.
Taliesin: No, that's a very dark and disturbing thought. I'm very impressed.
Marisha: Thank you! I've been learning from you.
Taliesin: Thank you. Now I feel guilty.
Marisha: I don't mean to question to him, he just said a few things that raised a few hairs on the back of my spine.
Laura: Well, maybe we can ask him about it?
Travis: You have hair on your spine?
Marisha: About this time I use Alter Self to go a little half-Minxie and get those-- like when a dog is pissed off and it puffs up the hair, towards Grog.
Matt: She shows you this emerging patch of fur that is like, shh, pushing out the back of her shoulders.
Laura: That's real sexy.
Travis: Pretty sweet.
Laura: Pretty hot.
Taliesin: It is a very fair point, although I would say I think it would be best to talk to Allura about your father rather than talk to him again, I think he's possibly had enough of us for a while.
Travis: So we have the meeting, we go get the tricorn hat from her, like, boudoir and then we go get the crest on the way out, right?
Sam: Maybe we can even find a clue about where this crest thing is from the meeting.
Matt: "Grand! That's a great idea! That's a great idea."
Laura: Should we sleep before the meeting?
Taliesin: I think the meeting is actually tomorrow.
Laura: Yes.
Sam: It just says we get one meeting, I don't think it's been "sheduled" yet. Should we go "shedule" it?
Laura: Let's "shedule" the meeting.
Travis: Or maybe we could send one of the shitty guards to go "shedule" it for us.
Laura: Is he back from getting us food? Oh no, I hope he's not, because I want to send a second one out there.
Sam: Ooh! Because you're a lady.
Laura: Because I'm a baroness.
Travis: I don't think they're going to leave us all alone.
Taliesin: I have made such a terrible mistake. (laughter)
Matt: You go and check, you check the hallway, and the guard hasn't returned and the three suddenly spin around as the door opens.
Laura: Hello! We require a meeting with the High Warden.
Marisha: I do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind. (laughter)
Matt: "I need to take this with me. To make the meeting schedulable."
Taliesin: Yes, of course.
Laura: "Shedulable."
Matt: "Shedulable."
Travis: Bidet!
Sam: When would we like the meeting? Tonight or tomorrow?
Laura: Tomorrow.
Liam: Tomorrow.
Matt: You guys did wake up about four hours ago?
Liam: Did we?
Sam: Today! Later today.
Taliesin: We'll take the meeting today.
Sam: Right after siesta.
Liam: It's like northern Alaska.
Matt: "Very well. I'll return." He turns around and leaves and the two guards look at each other like, thank god it wasn't us. They both stand at the ready as he goes.
Taliesin: Let that be a lesson to the two of you about making fun of a foreigner's accent. I'm watching you.
Matt: As the door slowly closes.
Taliesin: Schedulable!
Matt: The faun, of which is currently-- Garmelie is up on one of the beds right now, stretched out. "So! What are you waiting for?"
Laura: That's your bed, Keyleth.
Marisha: Aw, man.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Brings up one leg.
Laura: Trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in with him.
Matt: "No, don't, ugh!" (bear noises)
Marisha: Aw, they're shedding on it!
Matt: (creak, crash) The bottom cracks and the bed actually falls flat on the ground. The springs destroyed.
Taliesin: It's all right, it's a futon now. It's like college.
Travis: Have we seen any of these threshold crests on our way in?
Liam: Yeah, we walked past some.
Marisha: They're those little blue stones that are keeping the city here.
Travis: Don't say it like it's obvious. I don't pay attention to shit.
Laura: But we just need a sliver of one.
Travis: Right, so like, I could take Vax's head and smash it against one and then pick up the pieces. No, that's a bad thing from your frown.
Marisha: Although Grog doesn't have the worst idea. And I don't mean smashing Vax's head. That's not what I mean. But don't we have some hidden gems, because I'm really terrified if we start hacking away at these stones what might happen.
Laura: They might not be able to return.
Marisha: So maybe we can do something kind of fakey.
Sam: He's in the room. (laughter)
Marisha: Is he asleep? He's asleep, right?
Matt: No, he's currently partially crushed by Trinket on the bed and goes like, "I can hear you!"
Travis: I mean, we have jewels and shit, just stuff hanging around, but what does that do?
Sam: No, how do we know if we can chip a piece off without ruining it?
Laura: I wouldn't risk it.
Liam: I think we should talk to some people and ask a couple of questions around town first.
Laura: Yeah. Maybe somebody, maybe the High Warden knows. Maybe we can sneak it out of there or something.
Liam: Just drop it in passing.
Travis: Ooh! Like a souvenir. "Can we have a piece of your threshold crest?"
Laura: Exactly like that, Grog, exactly like that.
Travis: Shit, I have got all the good ideas today. (laughter)
Travis: I'm the leader. So what do we do until the guard comes back?
Matt: The door opens, the guard comes around with food and hands it out to the rest of--
Laura: Does anybody have money for a tip? Because I think you're supposed to tip them.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "You're not supposed to tip your guards." (boof) Slams the door behind.
Marisha: That's an Emon tradition. We're overseas, remember.
Taliesin: I like it here.
Matt: All right. You finish your meal.
Laura: It's delicious!
Matt: And prepare yourselves for an excursion into the city of Syngorn to seemingly steal a piece of the threshold crest and the High Warden Tyrelda's travel hat.
Marisha: I turn into Minxie and resign to the idea that I'm going to be sleeping with Garmelie and Trinket and just cuddle next to them in Minxie mode.
Laura: Are you coming with us, though, Keyleth?
Marisha: Oh, we're not sleeping?
Sam: No. It's like one in the afternoon, so we'll probably just go.
Liam: But you know, blow a couple more spells.
Matt: So that's one use of your beast form.
Laura: Just come on, then.
Marisha: I'll come on.
Liam: Just save it. You can stay like that, just walk close to me.
Marisha: Am I going to freak people out if I walk around like this?
Taliesin: God, I hope so.
Laura: Fuck them, that's what I say.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way outside into the city streets of Syngorn to hopefully wait for the other guard, who returns about ten minutes later to tell you, "It has been 'sheduled.'"
Travis: Ah, very good.
Matt: "As soon as you wish, attend to the central palace and there you will be greeted."
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: "Are you leaving now?"
Sam: Yes.
Travis: Well, we waste no time.
Matt: Makes a big whistle and the other guards come down, and collectively you now have four guards watching you guys.
Travis: Four?
Laura: Yeah. There were four of them.
Marisha: I drop Minxie form, because that seems very aggressive.
Sam: As we walk I say to Vax  Oi, Vax. What is the reason for this meeting? When we get in there, what do we say to her?
Marisha: Can we have your hat?
Liam: I don't think we should lead with that. Maybe work our way around to it. Well, I would like advice other than this little hairy man for how to get to the bog.
Laura: And also what we might face.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: And how we can fight what we might face.
Marisha: She might know about Fenthras and the bow.
Laura: Yes, exactly.
Travis: Wait, Scanlan, can't you go invisible too? What if you two little buggers just went off and like found it on your own while we were distracting Captain Fancy Hat.
Sam: Find Fenthras on our own, what?
Travis: Yeah, you go invisible along with Fauny Tim over here and you just go find the fucking hat.
Sam: Oh, the hat.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: What if she's wearing the hat? What if the hat is on her head?
Travis: We kill everybody. (laughter)
Taliesin: To be fair, that usually is the plan.
Matt: And thus ended the story of Vox Machina, murdered terribly in the streets of Syngorn by their own people.
Taliesin: Clutching a hat.
Travis: Tarantino film.
Matt: As you guys make your way towards the palace, formulating your plan, we're going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom break here. Guys, about ten, 15 minutes or so, we'll be back here in just a little bit. So use your restrooms, stretch your legs and come back. We'll see you all here in a few minutes. [no audio] (cheering)
Matt: That's a lot of people. Welcome back. First off, I want to say a big thanks to Amanda Mclean for making our awesome graphic for our intermission, thank you Amanda, appreciate that. (cheering)
Matt: We are back. Brought to you by Loot Crate. Let's dive back in, as you guys make your way through the city of Syngorn towards the palace to what would be the northern side of the city. Eventually you come upon the large, slightly swirling stairs that lead to the front of the large brass and ivory surrounded doorway that leads to the interior. You guys have not actually been inside this palace before; you've only seen it from a distance, as your father would not let you in too close to the center of the city. As you make your way up the stairs, you can see guards, the Verdant Guards step out in an aggressive and defensive way, but the guards to your sides immediately put their hands up and signal them to put their arms down and to stand at ease. You guys are brought to the front, the doors open, and a small elderly elvish gentleman comes out, his long white hair almost touching the ground as he shuffles up. He brings a small monocle up to the side of his face. "Yes? Do you have business in the palace?"
Liam: G'day mate.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: We do. We have a meeting with the High Warden Tyrelda.
Matt: "Let me see your papers. Oh, I see they're right here. Very well. Follow me, please." He turns around and walks his way into the building. You all follow suit and are led through the main entryway to the palace itself. On the inside you can see these giant archways that the pillars that hold them up look like trees that spread to the top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy made of marble with beautiful portraits and long artistic renditions of the creation of Syngorn, the people, each bloodline that has progressed and taken on the central political structure of the city. As it goes, you can see busts of people who have been of historical importance to Syngorn, and eventually you're brought to the very end of this hallway. Amongst a series of other offshoot hallways and doors, there is the next portion of this journey, this large central chamber. The door is already partially ajar. You are led into what seems to be the equivalent of a throne room, but it appears that there is a half-circle table in the center of the room and a series of chairs that now sit empty across from one side. Your side. The other side of the table, you see sitting quietly and patiently, an older elven woman, you can see the grey in her hair and the crow's-nests at the corner of her eyes, which in elven years means she's quite old, she's probably close to 150 or 200 years old, by your gathering. They can live quite a long time. She would be in the equivalent of her late 50s.
Sam: Not old enough for our party to kill mercilessly.
Matt: No, that's a whole different gauge.
Liam: Throwback Thursday.
Laura: Is she wearing a hat?
Matt: She is not wearing a hat.
Travis: Shit. All right, she lives.
Matt: The guard behind ushers you guys forward toward the chairs. You all get the idea that you should sit.
Sam: We sit.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Are there chairs for all of us?
Matt: There are chairs for all of you but Trinket, who currently, one of the guards is helping to put his hands out in front to keep back, like.
Laura: No.
Liam: That's a good way to lose a finger.
Laura: I wouldn't mess with him if I were you, just to be safe. And I walk up and I give Trinket a kiss on the nose and I put him in his Pokeball.
Matt: The guard leaps back for a second. "That's much easier."
Laura: Just watch closely, buddy.
Matt: You step back, you all find your seats.
Laura: Just talking to my boobs. No big deal.
Liam: Buddy, buddy. (laughter)
Matt: This meeting room pavilion, and as you all have your seat, you see the High Warden waiting there patiently, smile on her face but definitely an expression that shows both intelligence and guard. As you all sit, she looks about the group, asks, "So you've all come and made arrangements to meet with me. You've come quite a ways and with very short notice. I'm curious as to what your reasonings are. Please, state your business."
Liam: You probably recognize the two of us even if you don't know us. We're Syldor's children. This is my sister Vex'ahlia. I'm Vax'ildan.
Matt: "Strange. It has been some time since you've been within the city. Welcome."
Liam: Thank you.
Laura: We're back because we're searching for a certain bow, Fenthras? Said to be within the Murk something?
Liam: Bog of Eternal Stench, I believe.
Marisha: Shadowmurk Bog. That's the one.
Matt: "The Shademirk?"
Marisha: Shademirk. That's it.
Liam: It's not on a lark. We're not a bunch of fly-by-nights. We've already stopped to see Vex's and my father. Over the last several months, we have been dealing, a little more closely than most would want, with the Conclave, these dragons. We know that you are struggling to do the same. We have felled two of them, and I don't say that to brag, just to impress upon you how serious we are. We've come a long way, and we are in need of help. Thank you, darling. I think that the city's intentions are in the best possible place. Brings me a great deal of personal satisfaction, actually. I would like to offer our aid in service of the very same purpose, and that bow, in my sister's hands, will go a long way to felling more of these beasts.
Matt: "Well. You stroll in here with a great deal of arrogance and an air of self-importance. Not in a way that is negative, more in a way that means you aspire, and I hope, not reaching beyond your means. If you have indeed felled these two members of the Conclave as you say, then perhaps this errand to the Shademirk is not as dangerous as one would expect. I would not deny you this, and if you indeed have these capabilities, you should have no issue surviving the Mirk, you and your companions."
Laura: Syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the Shademirk.
Matt: "Well. The Shademirk, as far as I understand, was once a very beautiful landscape. That once was the fountain heart of the Gilded Run that provided the flowing rivers that spun throughout this entire region. There was an archfey many years before who was turned on by his beloved, who had been growing so spiteful, so full of angst and anger and vengeful thoughts that it turned his heart dark and black and he began to spill into the fen around him. It was there that these lands became the Shademirk. It was there that he became one with the land and corrupted it and turned it. Dryads turned foul and shadowed. Other creatures began to crawl up from the bog itself, and to this day feed off the life of those they can reach. The only thing that holds its spread at bay is the Gilded Run, the rapids. Now, it's found balance, and we watched it spread, as those who've lived here for a long time do. It does not force any sort of immediate threat to any of us, and it serves its own purpose. It has its new-- I shouldn't say new, it's been hundreds of years now-- but its own life, its own biome. And we could not be ones to mess with that, if you will. But it is dangerous, and it is, for those who have scouted far enough to see it, say it is akin to wading through an oil slick. It is to walk into a hungry swamp that never gives up its need to feed."
Laura: Sounds lovely.
Matt: "Yes, quite."
Laura: You say you've lived here. I know the city goes back and forth between the Feywild. Do you travel more freely?
Matt: "I haven't in my older years. When I was younger, perhaps. It is important to maintain an idea of the current state of the Feywild. Every few decades, perhaps every generation, just to be certain when we have to undergo this transition that we don't come into the middle of a war zone in its own right. But I grow tired in my older years, and find myself chained to politics more often than not."
Laura: How did you make that transition so easily? I know that the threshold crests are how the city gets around. (laughter)
Matt: "Well, there are thin areas between the planes, there are doorways, and we have magical means to send small scouting parties between this veil."
Sam: Go on.
Laura: Well, I don't want to be a bother, yes, but. Do they entail any part of those threshold crests? I'm wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling, as well.
Liam: We know we're strangers. But we read much wisdom and experience in your eyes, and it would seem that you have encountered this place yourself, or have experience in the past with those who have, and we're just looking for an edge, really.
Matt: You make a persuasion check.
Laura: Oh, do I want to roll this one or do I want to roll--
Travis: Oh, just pick one.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The ever-plight of Laura Bailey.
Laura: Ooh! That's a good, that's a good, I'm glad I switched!
Travis: There are 300 fucking dice on this table.
Laura: 27.
Liam: Ooh.
Matt: "We have refined the art of creating the threshold crests. We have personalized enchantments that can be utilized for our trained spies, our trained guides, our trained scouts. We keep them under lock and key, but when an endeavor requires the transference between planes, we do on occasion allow these to go into the hands of our greatest guides."
Laura: If a party would be in search of an item that would be of great use to your survival, would that be worthy?
Liam: Listen, we know we're bastards.
Laura: Stop bringing up the bastard part!
Liam: Clearly. Look into my eyes, we share the same goal. Half of my blood is yours. I want to kill the threat to your city and to all cities. I ask with complete humility. I know what I'm asking. Please.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Laura: Which one? Him or me?
Matt: Him.
Laura: Fuck, can I give him advantage, can I help him?
Liam: Using Luck.
Matt: No, he's got Luck. He has his own.
Laura: Come on, you motherfucker.
Liam: Ouch. I rolled the same thing. Low number twice. No, that's a big five.
Laura: Wait, no, everything's ten. I thought everything was a ten!
Liam: No, that's right, you're right. So that is a--
Laura: 12.
Liam: No, 13.
Sam: Oh, that's better.
Matt: It's better.
Laura: Why did you talk? I think she would've listened to me. (laughter)
Matt: "I appreciate your intent, and I understand that our current paths will hopefully align in the near future. However, such artifacts are very important to us and the business within Syngorn, and I mean no offense in saying that you are no longer residents of our city. As such, no, I cannot provide you with these crystals. However, when the time comes, and you retrieve this bow which you say you seek, I hope that we can count each other brethren on the battlefield."
Travis: Can I look around the room? Are there any doors open, ajar, leading into a bedroom with a hat on a rack?
Matt: Make a perception check, Grog.
Sam: Are there any guards in here with us?
Matt: Yeah, the guards have led you in, they're just back by the front door you entered.
Taliesin: There's a hat rack and a Starbucks, that's what's in the room right there. It's a hat rack and a Starbucks.
Travis: 19. Natural.
Liam: I'm rusty on my rules. That should've been a 17.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Liam: I rolled a three, but because of reliable talent, anything lower counts as a ten. Ten plus my persuasion of seven is 17. I'm just rusty.
Matt: I understand. Same answer. (laughter)
Liam: That is racist!
Matt: No, that is a very closely guarded item that would've required a roll of 20 or higher to succeed.
Liam: The whole time I was like, that seems wrong to me; that it's so low.
Matt: Yeah man, reliable talent's good for that reason.
Laura: Why did your luck suck that time?
Matt: It's all right. Grog, glancing about the room, your suddenly strangely keen giant eyes in an elvish realm, you who can read patterns in rock and mountain faces, but when looking at finely crafted marble it's just a big mess. You see at the very back of the chamber what appears to be an imprint into one of the sculptures, one of the almost silver and brass latticework that tends to look like climbing roots and vines across the back of the room. There is a door that is recessed within that, though it's hidden in the sculpture itself. "Now. Unless you have other business?"
Sam: I have a little bit of business.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Good, carry on. Sorry.
Sam: Everyone who meets me knows I am a collector of hats. (laughter)
Sam: I take out my beret and I put it on and I say, why, this one was a very special beret I got by defending Whitestone against an invasion of vampires, singlehandedly freeing the city from the scourge.
Matt: "That sounds entirely believable."
Sam: Yes. It's a fine garment woven by a master craftsman. I hear you have a fine hat, as well, that you've been seen wearing about town. Is that true?
Taliesin: I wish I could say this isn't true, but it's actually true. He is genuine.
Matt: "I have been known to have a few garments based on where I'm going, yes."
Sam: As a fine appreciator of the haberdasher arts-- (laughter)
Sam: A connoisseur, really. Could you humor an old gnome like me and show me... I hear tell of a green hat. A tri-tip hat, right?
Marisha: I thought it was blue.
Sam: Blue hat?
Marisha: Might be green.
Taliesin: He's also colorblind, I should mention.
Sam: Tri-tip, triangular-- I just hear it's fantastic, I've never seen one quite like it up close. I was wondering if I could take a look-see.
Matt: Make a deception check.
Sam: With disadvantage.
Matt: Yeah, because you didn't sleep.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't sleep, Scanlan!
Sam: Well, that was a natural 20. But the first one was a six. Luckily, it's plus 14, so 20. (laughing and cheering) [no audio]
Matt: Bards! "From political requests to a hat collector, this is indeed a very strange afternoon in the palace. Yes, I can have one of my servants show you."
Sam: Thank you so much, it would mean so much to me. I've never met a hat I didn't like.
Matt: "Then I am certain you will be fulfilled."
Sam: Should we just wait here, or is it going to be a while?
Matt: "No, I'll have a servant bring you up." And she puts her hand up and the guards open the door and you see a servant walk out who looks to be a younger elven man. Actually probably about the age of Vax there. Short tattered hair comes across in front of his eyes. He enters. "Yes, mother?" "Could you please show this strange little gnome man to the hat room?" "Yes, of course. Yes. Follow me."
Sam: There's a hat room? I have a hat room in my place, too!
Matt: "That's splendid. Now, is there any other business?"
Taliesin: Just to be clear, you would say that the river is probably our safest mode of entry into the bog?
Matt: "It surrounds the bog and runs past the southern portion of it, so you'll most likely come upon the river one way or another. Lest you wish to traverse the Green Sea, but that I would not recommend, either."
Marisha: So there's no real easy way into the bog, is what you're saying?
Matt: "There's no easy way to anything in the Feywild, my child."
Marisha: Got it.
Laura: Have you seen the tree yourself?
Matt: "I have not."
Taliesin: Are there river men who run boats on the river?
Matt: "No, the river tends to run itself." (laughter)
Taliesin: I had that coming. That's fair.
Travis: That's good.
Matt: "Do you wish to inquire about my shoes? My coat perhaps..."
Marisha: Oh my god, they're so cute, though. They're amazing shoes. I didn't notice them until you pointed them out, sorry. No, continue on.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Taliesin: I think that's all, yes.
Matt: "All right. Good luck. I wish you safe--"
Marisha: Oh, wait, wait, lady!
Sam: High Warden, High Warden.
Marisha: High Warden. I'm sorry. I was just curious. It's my first time to Syngorn, and it's in the Feywild. It's special, right? Is there a gift shop? A visiting the temple and sights of Syngorn type of shop?
Sam: I went to Syngorn and all I got was this lousy shirt?
Marisha: Right!
Laura: We have to make that shirt!
Liam: Shirt after this one.
Matt: "I'll see what Braum can do. Braum, please escort them to some semblance of a gift shop."
Marisha: Oh, thank you!
Taliesin: Good luck.
Matt: "Now, I have important business to tend to. Good luck. Safe travels. Don't die. Let us see each other on the battlefield soon to slay a dragon. Now, please, be on your way."
Laura: We appreciate your time.
Matt: You guys get up and leave, Trinket goes--
Laura: Trinket's in my necklace.
Matt: That's right, Trinket is in your necklace, so Trinket does nothing.
Laura: Trinket does nothing but stare outside of the necklace.
Matt: You make your way out of the room, the guards following suit. You can see the lightish brownish reddish tousled hair of the elven boy who's waiting, he's wearing very fine clothing, though very baggy on his scrawny frame. As you all step out, he says, "All right, so, I'm to take you to the hat room, I believe. Oh, you're going to be very happy. It's quite the room."
Sam: The room I could care less about, it's those hats!
Matt: "Well, I think you'll still be pleased. Are you all coming?" (noises of agreement)
Liam: Traveling with Scanlan, we've all become amateur hat enthusiasts.
Laura: I pull out my hat and I put it on.
Travis: Yep, I pull out the rhinoceros horn.
Liam: (gong) (laughter)
Matt: And he pulls out a little masquerade mask and goes like, "Oh my goodness!"
Sam: You're a hatter, too!
Marisha: Do you get the monthly newsletter?
Matt: "Well, I used to, until we came to the Feywild. It's very boring these days. Well, come, please!" And he darts off excitedly down the hallway. The guards groan loudly behind you. You make your way through the second hallway on the left of the palace, down a flight of stairs into a storage room. To the left you can see what looks to be the entrance to some sort of a heavily barred metallic doorway, about ten feet wide, about 12 feet tall. Further down you come to two doorways. He pulls out a keyring, goes, "No, not that one. Ah, here we are." It opens up into a small room, you can see in here, it's a display room. In here you can see ornamental armor and helmets and all sorts of classic Syngorean designs, which change often because, well, elves when they don't have a lot of things to fill their time with, it's all about designing new outfits and new armor. There's a whole display of very classic designs for the guards, for the watchers, for the people who first founded Syngorn. It's like a history walk through. But there is a section that is primarily helmet designs for different stations and, "This is as close to a hat room as we have. This here is part of the original Temple of Ioun design. It is a delightful piece." He keeps going on and on.
Laura: Do we see the hat that we're looking for in here?
Matt: You do see there is a small rack to the side which is for more just things that are used and you can see there are like wide-brim, rainy-day, carriage-driving hats, you can see there are far-brimmed cloak hoods that are used for horse-riding beneath the rain, you can see there are a few more curved up to one side archer-based hats, and you can see there a nice green velvet hat that is resting across.
Liam: Is that the one area with hats?
Laura: Are they all just jumbled in together?
Matt: They're all jumbled in together in that corner and then the actual helmets are against the wall in different setups.
Liam: Go ahead.
Laura: I nudge Vax and I point it out.
Liam: Scanlan, look at all those codpieces across the room!
Laura: Are the guards in here with us?
Matt: They are, yes.
Laura: I prat-fucking-fall. I pratfall right in front of the guards, on the opposite side of the room.
Matt: Which one?
Laura: I walk to the other side of the room and I just fall over.
Liam: Eat shit, knock shit over.
Matt: Make a perform check.
Laura: Oh, shit. Can it be acrobatics, though?
Matt: No, acrobatics is avoiding the fall.
Laura: Shit. Okay. 19?
Matt: 19!
Laura: I want to take some shit down with me.
Matt: And you do, delightfully so. You fall over, trip, go into a tumble, grab arm over pieces of metallic armor, (crashing sound).
Laura: Ah, oh god, did you see that--
Marisha: Oh my god, Vex, are you okay?
Laura: I think there was a marble on the ground.
Marisha: Oh no, what? Keyleth turns to the guard. (laughter)
Marisha: That was Lady Vex'ahlia, the Baroness of Whitestone. I could sue you! I could sue you for negligence.
Matt: Make a sleight-of-hand check.
Sam: Hold on, he's making a check.
Liam: 24.
Matt: All right. You take the hat. You place it away. Everyone seems to be focused on the currently yelling Vex'ahlia--
Laura: Ow, I think I hurt my wrist!
Marisha: You will get a letter from me, good sir. You will get a letter, okay?
Matt: "This was, look, I apologize if your friend is clumsy, but this wasn't part of our job description, okay, it's been a very--"
Marisha: Your five-star review just went to a four, okay? I just want to say.
Matt: Braum pushes his way in and goes like, "I am so terribly sorry. I didn't mean-- I hope this hasn't ruined your opinion of the hat room."
Laura: If we could just see a gift shop, I would be thrilled.
Travis: And I say to the side, I go, (coughs) pinch my knee, is that the one?
Marisha: What?
Matt: "Are you feeling all right, sir?"
Travis: Yeah, no, (coughs) pinch my knee if that's the one. No, to the little, to the little satyr.
Taliesin: Let's just find a gift shop, Lady Tyrell doesn't need to hear anything about this. Let's just move on.
Matt: "Lady who?"
Marisha: High Warden Tyrelda.
Sam: High Warden Tyrelda.
Taliesin: Tyrelda.
Sam: Yes, well, there's another lady named Lady Tyrell, who's...
Taliesin: No, this is amazing what my handwriting does.
Liam: What did you put in that tea, Percival?
Matt: "Well, I'm glad to see this hasn't ruined your opinion of the collections here."
Liam: Just the safety codes, really.
Marisha: If you took us to the gift shop, it might fix things. Okay?
Matt: "Then come, come! You two clean this up!" And the two guards go, "What?" "Yes, my lord." And the two guards eye you very intensely as they walk over and start picking up all the pieces of armor--
Laura: Ow!
Marisha: I start pretending like I'm doing a Cure Wounds spell to her wrist, you know?
Matt: All right. As you guys make your way out, with two of the guards now; two of them are now left behind.
Taliesin: As we walk out, I just make sure the two guards are, I hope this didn't interrupt your schedules for today.
Sam: "Shedule."
Taliesin: Yes, schedule.
Matt: Somehow their chin goes higher. It's impressive, really. You make your way through, down another set of hallways, back towards the beginning of the palace, he goes, "It's not really a gift shop, the closest thing that we could ascertain based on your request is, we do have a small collection of gifts and knick-knacks we've received from allies over time that really aren't much use to us."
Marisha: Wait, you're taking us to the lost and found? Please! This is the high baroness Lady Vex'ahlia!
Matt: "Perhaps you'll find something you like."
Laura: No, lost and found is a wonderful place to go.
Matt: "It's a combination lost and found and just... gifts from political allies that didn't understand the High Warden's aesthetic. Yes, no, please, this way please." And he leads you back to the main hallway you guys walked through, a little ways towards the entrance, and then another hallway to the left, he unlocks and this is straight-up like a dark storage room, it is just boxes and boxes that are sealed and he lights a small lantern on the side. It flickers to life, and the flame itself, as opposed to a low oil lantern flicker is like a bright glowing light, you can see this is a magically set lantern, as most of the lights in the city are just everlit torches or things that flicker on and off as a light spell. It illuminates the room around you and you can see no one's walked in here in a while.
Liam: These are for sale?
Matt: "No, these are for the taking should you wish."
Laura: Awesome.
Sam: Well, what do we see?
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigation check.
Marisha: Can I ask a logistical question?
Matt: Sure.
Marisha: Is Garmelie with us or did we leave him behind?
Matt: You don't know.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: You don't know.
Sam: Grog might know.
Liam: 18.
Marisha: Grog.
Laura: 19.
Matt: 18, 19, are you searching, Grog?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: What'd you get?
Travis: Nine. (laughter)
Marisha: Wait, is this an investigation?
Laura: Come on, natural 20!
Marisha: Natural one.
Liam: Oh, propeller beanie!
Matt: Keyleth is distracted by the pretty light in the fixture.
Sam: Natural one. (laughter)
Matt: Scanlan comes up next to her and is equally distracted by this wonderful magical light. Like two moths to a flame. Percival?
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: Nine. All right. The two twins, you guys spend some time looking through the nearby riffraff and Braum is in the back, hoping you find something to satiate your need for gifts. The twins find their way through a few boxes, and you open up and there's small porcelain dolls, dressed up in ancient Emon's outfits and designs. You can see what looks to be very dusty Kraghammer designed weaponry, you can see what looks to be a bunch of small game pieces that half of them have been lost, like a chessboard of some kind, but only part of it's there. This is really the junk room. This is where all the really bad Christmas presents get put every year. "No, thanks, it's great!"
Sam: Is it like Storage Wars, where there might be something?
Matt: It could, it could be depending on how well you search.
Sam: Well, I searched terribly.
Matt: You did.
Marisha: Keyleth starts talking up Braum. Braum?
Matt: Okay. Braum.
Marisha: Braum. So, Braum. Where're you from?
Matt: "Syngorn?" (laughter)
Travis: Good start.
Sam: We don't have to distract him, he said it's all for the taking.
Marisha: Oh, it's all for-- really, oh.
Sam: No, that's fine, we don't have to.
Marisha: You didn't see any distraction. You didn't see anything.
Matt: "I am so confused by all of you."
Laura: Can I try to do an arcana check to see if there's anything magic in the room?
Matt: Sure. Make an arcana check.
Travis: I'll join you. Two.
Laura: Oh shit, I just rolled off the table. How did I do that? 16.
Matt: Your untrained, though natural arcane instincts reveal to you that--
Laura: I can speak with animals.
Matt: Yes, you can. And there are no animals here. Nothing even remotely magical seems to cross your attention span, unfortunately, and you guys spend a good hour in here sifting through--
Liam: As, as we're digging in the corner, I say, I thought maybe coming back here I might like this city a little bit better, and I was fucking wrong.
Laura: This place fucking sucks.
Sam: Let's get out of here.
Travis: Yeah, there's nothing in here.
Sam: No, let's leave.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, sure. Yeah.
Travis: Let's go.
Taliesin: Pick something pretty.
Marisha: Your four-star rating just went down to a three.
Taliesin: I am picking something random from the room.
Marisha: And I'll also pick something random out of spite. I'll take this.
Matt: You have a fine tobacco box at your disposal now, Keyleth. You can write that down.
Marisha: I like it. I chose it on purpose.
Matt: Percy, you find half of a jeweler's kit.
Taliesin: That's perfect.
Marisha: That's awesome.
Taliesin: I am excited. Was it literally cut in half, like literally?
Matt: Half the supplies are there.
Marisha: And did you say I had a half a tobacco box? Or no, just a tobacco box?
Matt: You had an older tobacco box.
Marisha: An old tobacco box. All right. Yeah, sure.
Matt: Braum at this point goes, "I hope you've all found something you liked."
Laura: All right, I grab something random, too. I mean, if we're all doing it.
Matt: All right. You reach into the Syngorean Wal-mart gift bag on the way out.
Liam: Come on, secret Santa.
Laura: Come on. Roll for value.
Matt: No. I'll do that.
Laura: No whammies.
Matt: You bring out what looks to be a really intricately carved music box made of dark wood.
Laura: Ooh, that's neat.
Matt: As you shake it, you hear (ting-ting) little remnants of the last winding come through, and it seems to still play.
Laura: Mine. I'm writing it down.
Travis: All right, I want to reach in and grab something out of there too. All right, fine!
Matt: You reach in and you pull out a potato. (laughter)
Matt: But it's been there for a while, so like the roots are growing out and everything.
Liam: Oh, with leaves coming out of it.
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I take a bite out of it.
Matt: That is a stale potato.
Liam: Make a constitution check.
Marisha: Keyleth takes the potato. Okay, give it to me, give it to me.
Travis: Oh here you go. And I squash it in my hand.
Matt: (squelch) up the sides of it. Braum goes, "If you could clean that up?" And the guard goes aww and starts picking up the potato chunks off the ground.
Laura: We're down to one!
Liam: Hey gang, I feel like we've lost focus here. (laughter)
Liam: Maybe we should--
Sam: --get out of here.
Laura: Oh, do we find any broken threshold crests?
Matt: You do not.
Laura: Damn it.
Marisha: Okay, wait, do we find any pictures of threshold crests? Or a postcard?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Laura: All right.
Travis: We leave.
Marisha: We'll just go.
Sam: We got the hat.
Taliesin: We have a plan.
Matt: Braum leads you out of the room, closes and locks it behind, you guys walk back to the hallway that split off, you go past the large metal door again, find your way up into the foyer area at the front of the palace, he goes, "Well, I hope I've been of help to you. I hope I've delivered your interest in seeing our fine selection of helmets and hats here in Syngorn?"
Sam: I am more than satisfied. I will write a five-star review.
Matt: "I don't know what any of that means, but I assume that's good, and I thank you for that. Goodbye."
Laura: Thank you.
Taliesin: Charming.
Marisha: Good day.
Laura: Good day.
Matt: The guard that was cleaning the potato follows suit, you guys now have two guards, the other two have not returned. So you have two guards following you.
Travis: I don't know if you guys noticed, but there was this recessed door up in the queenie's room, but I don't know if maybe she would have some fancy stuff back there. Can't shake these guards.
Sam: Well, some of us could slip in anyway, but what do you think we will find there?
Travis: Well, I don't know. I just noticed, because I wasn't paying attention to all the talking.
Marisha: I think Percy and I can fake them out.
Sam: Fake them out? What do you mean, fake them out?
Marisha: Wait, is he around? Don't say it out loud.
Taliesin: There's no fake. It's not faking. I've got a plan. It's not fake, I've got a plan. It's a good plan. But we should sit, recuperate, go somewhere quiet and figure out how we're getting to the bog.
Marisha: How long have we been awake at this point?
Matt: You mean since you guys woke up this morning, I'd say six hours?
Laura: That's it?
Travis: We don't want to go try and bust one of the crests we already saw?
Laura: We could seriously like fuck it up, what if they can't get back?
Travis: Who gives a fuck?
Laura: They have an entire army to help fight Thordak.
Travis: I didn't think that far ahead, I'm sorry.
Sam: Well, Vex, they could repair it; they have magicians here and stuff.
Travis: Thank you, Scanlan.
Taliesin: How do you repair a--
Sam: With arcane juju.
Laura: You make a very good point. A very good point.
Marisha: But they said they got these stones from the other side, from our realm.
Laura: Maybe we should just go fucking check them out.
Liam: The two guards are here to whole time, right?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Yeah. We should really go take a nap, I think we should go take a nap.
Laura: This dusk is really making me--
Matt: Vex. You hear muttered under the breath of one of the guards, "Thank god." (laughter)
Matt: Very low; nobody else hears it.
Marisha: I've got plenty of energy.
Laura: I mean, is, is anyone else super duper tired? Are you guys tired?
Marisha: I'm--
Marisha: Tired.
Taliesin: Tired.
Marisha: So tired.
Laura: I look at the guards. I mean, are you guys tired? I mean, how do you even know what fucking time it is, right?
Marisha: Right?
Matt: "Do you wish to be escorted to your quarters, then?"
Laura: I would love to get some sleep.
Matt: "Please follow us." And they both lead on, leading you back to the rooms you guys had set for the evening's rest. Eventually you get to your rooms, the guards stay stationed outside, and you are led into your individual spaces.
Laura: There's windows though, yeah?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And the guards leave us in our rooms, obviously.
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: So wait, are we all in our own individual rooms?
Taliesin: We have earrings, we could just talk on the earrings.
Matt: You all go into a room together, then.
Laura: Super duper happy, all together.
Matt: You have four rooms at your disposal and you all say, we're going to go sleep, and all go into one room with a broken bed.
Sam: We're a close-knit family.
Liam: You can make your own assumptions.
Marisha: We can go into our own rooms and I can fix it if we don't want to tip people off.
Sam: No, we do what we want.
Travis: Yeah, we're fucking close, man.
Matt: All right, you guys all enter the largest room where you met before, and as you all find your way in there, one of the guards goes, "You're going to sleep--"
Marisha: It's for prayer. We have to pray. Remember, right, Grog?
Travis: Oh yes, we're very holy.
Laura: Yes, it's been quite a while. I'm rather hungry.
Sam: We all sleep together; it's a polyamorous thing. (laughter)
Travis: I told you we were holy.
Matt: Scanlan and Vex, make deception checks, please.
Laura: Perception?
Matt: Deception.
Liam: Deception.
Laura: Deception. Oh. Ten?
Sam: 21.
Liam: (cackles) That's the lie that goes through.
Matt: When you say you're tired and ready to rest, the guard goes, "Mm-hm." And then when you say polyamorous, the guard goes, "Oh." (laughter)
Sam: Yeah, man. We are freak-ay.
Liam: I grab Grog by the circlet thing and say, come on, I'm tense. Let's go. (laughter)
Matt: The two guards, the two guards look at each other and take two steps away from the room. "We'll keep a close watch."
Marisha: Keyleth says, we're totally polyamorous--
Taliesin: You! No!
Marisha: And I turn Percy and Vax into squirrels with Polymorph. See? Polyamorous.
Matt: The two guards look at each other, very disturbed and say, "You've already shared too much, we don't judge, just please go 'sleep'." They both hold their blades at the ready, both just like, "What is my life right now?" All right.
Sam: We may need you to clean up for us later.
Matt: "Please! Go! Sleep!" You guys are now closed off inside your room.
Laura: And the squirrels.
Matt: As squirrels. What are you going to do?
Marisha: Okay, I drop Polymorph. That's what polyamorous means, right, guys?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Garmelie, show thyself.
Matt: He appears and goes like, "Was that true?" (laughter)
Matt: He has his sketchbook at the ready and is like, "Because I mean..."
Taliesin: No. No.
Sam: You don't know.
Matt: "Well." He closes the book. "So. I believe someone here took a hat?"
Liam: I might have a hat for you. The other adventure didn't turn out so well, and I really want to give you this hat. I'm wondering-- fuck it, I don't have anything to say, take the fucking hat.
Matt: And he puts it on. It's a little small. But he goes, "Ah, it's fine." Smiles back.
Liam: So worth it.
Laura: Yeah. That was definitely worth it.
Matt: He seems extremely proud and happy that this hat is now in his possession. "One of two. Now, the second part."
Sam: Any ideas there, Garmelie?
Matt: "No."
Laura: You passed by those threshold crests several times, I'm assuming.
Taliesin: Let me get this straight, Garmelie. You require of us a piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes."
Taliesin: Any threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Taliesin: Just as long as it's a threshold crest.
Matt: "Yes!"
Marisha: And looks like a crest.
Taliesin: It's a threshold crest.
Matt: "A threshold crest."
Taliesin: Okay, Keyleth. The thing we talked about.
Marisha: And I start casting Stone Shape right under the threshold of the door to the room that we're in, and I cut out a crest from the threshold.
Matt: What crest do you create? What does it look like?
Marisha: A Whitestone crest. From the threshold of the door.
Taliesin: We break it.
Marisha: There's a piece of your threshold crest. (laughing and cheering)
Taliesin: Don't cast Friends on people. It's not nice.
Matt: You watch as his ears, his pointed ears slowly slink back and his hair stands up all across the back of his head, his beard almost bristles out into spines as the hat goes (poink) and pops off and hits the ground. He snatches it up. Grabs the piece.
Taliesin: That's your threshold crest. Piece of a threshold crest.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: Yay!
Matt: "Well, it appears that our deal has been kept." (laughing and cheering)
Matt: He snaps his fingers and you feel like this sudden, this almost unnoticeable pressure at the base of your neck that you had felt since you made the deal release and absolve, on both of you. "All right, so. Well, at least I got the hat out of it. So. The Shademirk, then? Come, follow me, grab your things." (laughs)
Marisha: Let's go.
Taliesin: I cannot wait.
Matt: "Now." He vanishes. And Grog, you feel a little tug on your finger to pull you forward.
Travis: I fart. (laughter)
Matt: "I had that coming. We now have even more of a reason to make haste. This is a very small room, and I've been following behind him for quite some time. Let's go. Now, quickly." And you see Grog being pulled forward by the finger, and you guys get the feeling that he's leading you out of the city, invisible, by Grog's finger.
Travis: We're going this way. Follow me, chaps!
Marisha: Follow the finger.
Sam: Are the guards following?
Matt: The two guards are following, yes.
Laura: Woo, that was really fun.
Marisha: My hair is messed up.
Sam: Good sesh.
Laura: Good. That was really...
Liam: Thanks, Grog. (laughter)
Liam: I feel loose as a goose. Let's go see this bog.
Marisha: And I transform into a goose and come out as a goose.
Matt: "You-- (frustrated noise) Never mind." The guards follow at a very healthy distance now, both whispering to each other as they watch you walk.
Laura: I think we made a really good impression on this city coming back.
Travis: I'm going to kill you later.
Matt: You guys are led back through the main portion of Syngorn, towards the front gates where the watchers reside. The doors are opened for you, and you are escorted out the front gate, where the guards very happily leave you to be. And both turn around at each other and go, (heavy sigh) and they walk back inside the confines of the outer Syngorean wall. You guys are now back out in the wilds of Syngorn, the finger tugs lead you out past the front of the city, through the marshlike mandrake fields that you initially traversed when you made your way to Syngorn, and then find your way back into the Ever-Shifting Grasses, heading duskward, towards where it seems the dusk sun will set.
Laura: Duskward.
Taliesin: Duskward.
Marisha: Always duskward.
Sam: I hate that direction.
Matt: There's also nightward, seaward, or tangleward. Which would you prefer?
Sam: Are those different directions?
Matt: Yes, those are different directions.
Laura: Tangleward? Did you say tangleward?
Matt: Tangleward. It was mentioned before, yeah.
Laura: Oh. I just thought of the Disney movie and I think I spaced out there.
Matt: I'm pretty sure that the people in the Feywild haven't seen that. Not yet. They're waiting for it to come out on Blu-Ray. All right. So you make your way towards where the grasses get heavy again, and you see Garmelie (foosh) once again take visible form again and be like, "Ah, sorry, that concentration for a while really gets to you, I'm so glad to be out of that stuffy place. So! Shall we?" Rights his hat. And even in righting it, it's a little crooked to one side and he begins marching duskward.
Laura: Onward to the theater!
Matt: "No! No theater! We are avoiding the theater! No."
Travis: Garmelie, how far of a journey is it to this bog?
Matt: "Say about four times since we met?"
Laura: Okay.
Travis: That doesn't mean anything to me.
Laura: Four times since we met.
Liam: I'm just curious, why are you so worried about the theater? I love the theater.
Matt: "I have my reasons." And he continues walking forward.
Liam: Thanks, great. Good talk.
Laura: It's been 14 hours since we've met.
Sam: Can we travel any faster than that? Can we mist, can we tree, can we...?
Laura: Wait a minute, you could-- if you know a tree is-- that would be pretty stupid, to just pop out of the cancerous tree, but if we know a tree is there, couldn't you potentially just fucking do it?
Liam: You've had a lot of good ideas. That's not one of them. That's a bad idea.
Marisha: She's not wrong.
Laura: Wait! Keyleth, what if you just open up the cancerous tree, we reach through, we grab the fucking bow, and then we're out.
Marisha: Well, you're not entirely wrong, I don't know if I can Teleport via Plants because generally that takes knowing the plant. However, I do have Tree Stride, which means we can-- nope, never mind, I can only do that on myself.
Matt: Wah-wah.
Taliesin: We are not sending Keyleth the goose into a bog to retrieve a bow from an angry cancerous tree.
Marisha: But I'm loosey! I'm a loosey goose.
Matt: That would look amazing on an epitaph, I'm just saying.
Marisha: We can mist there.
Sam: Would that save time, I don't remember how fast we go.
Marisha: I might have to take a hot nap.
Travis: A hot nap?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Didn't you guys just take a hot nap? (laughter)
Marisha: Yeah. The answer is yes. I can do all those things.
Taliesin: Well, let's travel for a bit and then we'll take a proper break.
Marisha: If we can get to the edge of the bog, then we'll take a sleep.
Laura: Wait, I think the edge of the bog is kind of far, though.
Taliesin: We'll start our journey, and the next leg of our journey.
Travis: Yeah, let's get going.
Marisha: We'll go until we're tired.
Matt: "I like the sound of that."
Laura: Oh. (belches) (laughing and cheering)
Matt: "Most impressive for a lady."
Laura: Thank you. That's a baroness burp.
Marisha: Robert Durst shit.
Matt: As you guys push on further northward at the behest of Garmelie, you push for another two hours or so through the Ever-Shifting Grasses, and as you get further and further north, the color of the grass seems to go from that deep verdant green to almost a maroon purplish color.
Laura: I pop Trinket out of the necklace.
Matt: He attacks some of the grass and chews it up.
Laura: Yeah, get it!
Marisha: Don't touch the grass, it'll get angry at you! It'll yell at you for a week!
Travis: I don't think that applies here.
Laura: It's okay, darling. It's okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: What?
Laura: Do not yell at my bear.
Marisha: I was just trying to protect him.
Liam: I give him some grass.
Marisha: Don't!
Sam: It's fine.
Taliesin: It's fine.
Matt: And just keeps going forward through the grass fields.
Marisha: Does the grass seem angry?
Matt: No, it just seems to be changing color.
Marisha: Suck it, grass!
Matt: As you say that, the grass goes from a purplish color to a deep, deep red around you.
Sam: Oh god.
Marisha: Because you... suck out the joy of all of us living around you, and you're so amazing.
Travis: That makes it even worse.
Sam: Not a compliment.
Travis: You're still going in the same direction.
Marisha: I mean, you suck out bad--
Liam: I grab Keyleth's hand. Let's take a walk.
Matt: All of you, as you're walking, the actual grasses around you are getting more and more dense and are catching on your feet and you're finding that your progression is getting slower and slower.
Laura: Wait, no. I have Landstride, which means I don't slow against any land.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine, you just coast ahead. The rest of the party, it's like they're going through waist-high thickets. The grass looks gentle, but as soon as it hits your body, it rakes across it almost like very fine serrated plants, and it's catching on your clothing and pulling you back. It's almost like since those statements were made... (laughter)
Travis: I have a hooded lantern. I could set this whole fucking thing ablaze.
All: No!
Matt: The red goes to a deep cinder-like red.
Sam: Are we going to have roll initiative on grass?
Laura: No, wait.
Taliesin: Does no one-- I'm going to take a moment.
Marisha: I feel like the grass feels our emotions.
Sam: Your emotions. Because you yelled at it.
Taliesin: Lovely field, I apologize for the rudeness of my compatriots. We will be gentle trouncing through you. We will make as little mark as we can and enjoy the splendor of your ever-changing colors. You are majestic, you are windswept-- I'm flirting with grass-- you are everything I could hope for in a beautiful view.
Sam: I sing a song.
Matt: What do you sing? (cheering)
Sam: (singing) Keep growing. Keep flowing, knowing you can always count on me.
Travis: (singing) For sure.
Laura: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) For sure.
Sam: (singing) That's what Scanlan's for. (cheering)
Matt: Percy, I want you to make a persuasion check against the grass? Adding the d10 inspiration die.
Taliesin: Oh, d10 inspiration. Come on.
Marisha: I do an interpretive dance.
Sam: Come on, persuade that plant.
Taliesin: That was leaning.
Sam: That was a leaner.
Taliesin: That jumped, but that's still fine, okay, it's. Persuasion check? Oh yeah, that's not bad. 24.
Matt: What was it?
Taliesin: Eight plus six plus seven. (counting) 21.
Sam: It's more than that.
Matt: Between the interpretive dance of Keyleth amongst the tattered angry grasses, the beautiful vocal stylings of Scanlan Shorthalt, and Percy speaking out a wondrous poem towards the Ever-Shifting Grasses, you watch as the deep bright red subsides into the relaxed purple, and eventually goes back to a dull green, and you find your traveling no longer impeded as it once was.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Good job!
Laura: Good job!
Matt: You successfully parlayed with a field.
Travis: First doors, then grass.
Liam: Don't talk shit to grass!
Sam: How do you want to mow this? (laughter)
Matt: So. About another half an hour of travel before in the distance ahead of you can see the dark edge of what looks to be another forest ahead of you, wide and almost end-to-end, you see it. A lot of these wooded areas almost meet the horizon, it's like you're stepping into just an endless wall of trees. As you begin to approach closer to the edge, Garmelie looks up and says, "All right. So we have choices now. We have the Moonbrush before us, or we have the Green Sea, which is far seaward of here. I would recommend the Moonbrush."
Sam: Then we should go the other way. Because we don't trust a fucking thing you say.
Matt: "Very well."
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: No, the High Warden did say--
Marisha: -- to avoid the Green Sea.
Laura: Why do you recommend the Moonbrush?
Matt: "Because it's the only real route to get to the Gilded Run."
Laura: What is the Gilded Run?
Matt: "The Gilded Run are the rivers that surround it."
Laura: Right, those.
Matt: "Yes. You're looking for the Shademirk. You have to get through the Gilded Run to get the Shademirk. You have to go through the Moonbrush to get to the Gilded Run."
Liam: Where's the theater?
Matt: "No theater!"
Travis: Right, so we're going through the brushy moon?
Matt: "Yes! Come, come."
Laura: Yeah? Are you okay with that, Scanlan?
Sam: I'll allow it.
Marisha: How long have we been awake?
Matt: You are... you've been awake for about 12 hours now, I'd say.
Marisha: If we want to mist there, then we have to sleep. But we'll press on for a few more hours.
Matt: Certainly. About another 40 minutes of foot travel before you begin to hit the edge of the Moonbrush Forest. As you approach, Garmelie says, "All right, so things you should know about the Moonbrush. One: it is home to a number of denizens." And as you look overhead, you can see it's a thick fog that permeates the entirety of this forest. You can see the outline of every tree trunk towards the outer rim of this entire brush. The canopy of the trees themselves are like long weeping willows that sag and give this very ominous feeling to the entire forest. You can see small mountain spires breaking through portions of the tree line in the distance occasionally, miles between each other, sometimes a cluster far closer together. He says, "There is a clan of sorts that lives amongst the forest, we'll try our best to avoid. They are natural hunters and they are of the lycan persuasion."
Sam: Oh.
Taliesin: Oh.
Matt: "So, best that we avoid interaction. They are well-read, they have a society; we should touch none of it."
Marisha: Question. You mentioned we are going into the Moonbrush with lycan hunters?
Matt: "Yes. It's a necessity."
Marisha: Yeah, no, it sounds like it. Yeah.
Matt: "Yes. But they do have natural enemies. There is a faction of pixies that live within, known as the Wishers, and they are forever locked in a struggle. So avoid both, do not get involved at all, and we'll be fine."
Laura: Do the lycan tend to populate trees, or if we stay up high can we maybe avoid them?
Matt: "Actually, they travel mostly in the trees. That's the easiest way for them to hunt, is unseen."
Laura: Well, there you go.
Matt: "They are ruled by a singular lycan lord, who goes by the name of Ukurat."
Marisha: What?
Sam: Ulurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Marisha: Ukurat.
Laura: Ukurat or Udurat?
Matt: "Ukurat."
Laura: Ukurat.
Liam: Ukurat.
Matt: "U-K-U-R-A-T."
Travis: Bob.
Matt: "He is to also be avoided."
Taliesin: Is that an elven name? Is that an elven word?
Matt: "It was, once."
Laura: Wait, he used to be elven? He used to be elven.
Matt: "They all used to be many things. He happened to be elven at one time, yes? So. Anyway. We'll avoid them, and avoid the Wishers, and also those things, the little plants that you saw before?"
Laura: Mandrakes?
Matt: "Mandrakes? Also everywhere. Avoid them."
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "And we'll just avoid the other things I mentioned, so. Shall we?" And he begins to step and march up to the edge of the Moonbrush.
Taliesin: Okay.
Sam: It's fine. We've killed dragons, we'll be fine.
Travis: I'm so stoked right now.
Marisha: Did we-- okay, yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way into the dark Moonbrush itself and as you walk into the forest, immediately you can hear the swell of distant crickets, thousands upon thousands, sourceless, fill the air around you.
Sam: Audience, please. (cricket noises, laughter)
Matt: That works, I was going to look for cricket sounds here. That's also totally doable.
Marisha: Someone's got a really good one.
Matt: As you walk in, the actual dusk light that has permeated the Feywild begins to give way to the first signs of night. You can look up through the different breaks in the tree line, you can see stars for the first time. And you can see what looks to be a very dull white glow of moonlight hitting some of the trees and breaking through some of the treetops themselves. The underbrush itself is very soft and spongy, with a lot of leaves that have fallen and given this soft setup. As you guys push forward for another half-hour or so, you in particular, Vex'ahlia, come upon what looks to be a series of stones, what looks to be a series of small structures, almost. Not like buildings per se, but intently placed obelisks of raw, rough stone. And as you come across and look on that side, you can see what looks to be the base of one of the mountain spires that sticks out, a large cave.
Laura: Do I see any kind of markings on the obelisks?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh. Get out of here!
Matt: What'd you get?
Laura: Natural one.
Matt: Natural one.
Laura: I know!
Matt: They just look rough and old. They've been placed there. It's old magic.
Liam: God, you're so bad at D&D!
Laura: I suck!
Matt: But you do see around the ground right out in front of this cave what appears to be hundreds and hundreds of small objects, piles, what looks like fruits and flowers and bones and stone carvings, all sorts of things placed in front of this cave.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on one of the bones to see if I can identify where it came from?
Matt: Okay. So you head out and take one of the bones and look at it. Go ahead and make a nature check.
Marisha: Yeah, the closest bone, I don't want to, ooh. Yeah.
Taliesin: That ain't nothing to sneeze at.
Marisha: No, it's not. 28.
Matt: 28. This bone belongs to a larger bird, like a great eagle, you can't quite specifically make out what it is, but it's been carved with small letters into it of a language you can't understand. It looks like it's some sort of a ritual item that's been placed there in the ground. But as you pick up and make this moment noticed--
Liam: I'm going stealth just because.
Matt: You all hear a giant, echoing roar coming from the cave.
Liam: Was I fast enough?
Matt: (roars) What'd you roll?
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30. Okay, yeah. You just (bip) out; you are gone. The rest of you are right at the outside of this small clearing where all of these small objects have been placed, you hear this rumbling loud roar come tearing through.
Marisha: I step back with the bone.
Matt: Okay. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Laura: I pull the broom out from behind my back.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Can I lean the bone over to Vex'ahlia and be like, is this Draconic?
Laura: Is it Draconic?
Matt: It is not Draconic.
Marisha: God fucking damn it.
Laura: Is it anything that I recognize, though?
Matt: What languages do you know?
Laura: Elvish, Abyssal, Undercommon.
Matt: No, none of those.
Laura: Shit.
Matt: However, at this time the trees behind you two, because the rest of you guys were staying back--
Laura: Who's you two?
Matt: Vex and Keyleth. The trees (fwoosh) shift and close off the exterior. As you turn towards the entrance of the cavern, you can see emerging from the front a giant-- it's hard to really tell the first moment that it appears, but you see what looks to be a gargantuan dire bear-like entity made of crackling blue ghostly energy, shimmering, translucent, not actually a physical form, but massive in size. (stomping noises, roar)
Marisha: Wait, did we get cut off? Did Vex and I get cut off from everybody else?
Matt: Yep. From everybody else.
Laura: Shit! I grab Keyleth's wrist and I fly into the air.
Marisha: I hold on for dear fucking life.
Matt: As you grab her wrist as you fly up, the trees, swoosh, close off and you go slamming into the tree boughs (crashing sound). You lose the broom for a second. Go ahead and hold your grip. Go ahead and make a strength check.
Laura: A strength check!
Sam: We can't even see them, Matt?
Matt: You guys can't see them and they just closed off in the trees.
Laura: Come on! Is that a saving throw or just a check?
Matt: Just a check.
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five? You lose your grip on the broom, and both Vex and Keyleth tumble down about 20 feet, you both suffer seven points of damage as you slam into the center of another pile of what looks like knick-knacks and things that are gathered on the floor. It's at this point that your mind hits that these are probably offerings, these are things that are left as some sort of offering to this bear-like spirit entity that exists in this cave. The bear, which is now, (stomping sounds), coming up towards you on the ground. Looks to Keyleth, (roars).
Marisha: Hi!
Laura: I cast Speak With Animals!
Matt: Okay, you cast Speak With Animals.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Like I taught you!
Laura: (weak growling sounds) (laughter)
Laura: And I say, we mean you no harm, great ghost bear! In fact, we brought you an offering and we just accidentally touched the other offering of yours.
Liam: Où est la bibliothèque? (laughter)
Laura: The cheese is old and moldy.
Matt: None of the bear's face moves at all, but an echoing voice, in Common, not animal speak, comes blasting into both of your minds, and those of you guys outside of the trees, trying to find a way through, also hear this echo, "You have entered the domain of Orlan. You destroy and disgrace that which was gifted. What do you offer in response to your travesty?"
Laura: Yeah, well, I--
Sam: We have a hat. A really good hat.
Marisha: I've got an old tobacco box I got from lost and found.
Laura: Ooh, yeah, that's pretty good. I offer him a tea set.
Matt: As you pull the tea set out, the bear claw reaches out and smashes it out of your hand and goes scattered and breaking across one of the stones and goes, "You walk into the realm of the wild, unwatched, unrespecting. The beasts of this land hold no kinship with you. You will prove offering yourself." And the tongue licks the lips.
Marisha: What? I turn into a giant scorpion.
Matt: The scorpion takes its form, as it does the bear, (growls).
Marisha: You want an offering, you can have mine.
Matt: Make a persuasion check on that.
Marisha: Oh god.
Liam: By the way, am I hidden in or outside?
Matt: You're outside.
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Good job, Keyleth!
Marisha: Thank you!
Matt: "I sense you have kinship with beasts. You may pass, though I will not forgive this infraction. You."
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: "You shall be the prize."
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Matt: The giant bear is looming over you now, and its size is so immense, probably 15 or 20 feet to the top of its shoulders.
Laura: Trinket! I call Trinket.
Matt: You call Trinket?
Laura: I call Trinket.
Matt: Leaps out of your necklace and lands right beside you and just roars, (roars) up to the spirit. The spirit pulls back, (roars), roars back. And Trinket is so tiny by comparison and is up to the elbow, but Trinket lashes out at the giant bear, just leaps up towards it, pushes into it and starts tearing at its throat. The giant bear takes Trinket with one claw and slams him into the ground. Trinket rolls and gets back up, (growls), you can see a little bit of blood at the corner of its mouth, and just lunges again, this time jumping up onto the bear's back and clawing up onto its, onto the top of its torso. The bear (growls).
Laura: He's pretty cool.
Matt: The bear head looks up at Trinket now gnawing onto its hide, (gnawing sounds), seemingly to no real effect, and the bear reaches up and grabs Trinket and plucks him off the side and sets him down next to you. The bear now begins to speak in the language of bears, which only you can understand at this moment, says, "You walk with this one. Is she your charge?" And Trinket voices back, you hear the (bear noises) up to the bear, as you hear coming out, "She is everything. Her life is mine. You take her, you take me, or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul." The giant bear looks down, "Very well. If you are at her side, I take your charge, as well." And the spirit bear steps forward, passing through you, and passing through Trinket's form, and what feels like this rush of warm air. And then disperses into a series of sparkles. You watch the energy slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you, and everything gets quiet. The trees slowly creak back and open the perimeter of this forest around you, leaving you alone. And Trinket comes up and licks your face.
Laura: Oh! (cheering)
Matt: As he's looking at you, you look down and you can see the necklace that you hold is actually shimmering with a blue light that passed through you, and it slowly fades to its dark normal form.
Sam: You're part bear now!
Matt: So. That's your new item card for Raven's Slumber. (cheering)
Audience member: What's it do?
Laura: I don't know.
Matt: So. I've got to finish this quickly because we've got to get to the Q and A, but as of this point in time, and I'll give you an ability card, but Trinket now benefits from your Hunter's Mark. (cheering)
Matt: And has an ability called Primal Fury you can use once per short rest that I'll get to next episode. As you all gather around this moment of silence, this quiet tension that has now dispersed, you see Trinket lift up Vex from the base of her cloak and put her back on her feet, nuzzles the side of her, and you can see the trees overhead open up a little wider than they were before, leaving some moonlight to hit the two of them. And that's where we'll go ahead and leave this session this week. (cheering)
Matt: Thank you, guys! (cheering)
Audience member: Is it Thursday yet? (cheering)
Matt: Thank you. (laughs) Thank you guys so much for joining us here live, this has been an awesome and incredible first experience for all of us. Thank you so much for tuning in and watching with us this week. We're looking forward to the GenCon show in a few weeks, so some of you guys over on that side of the US can hopefully come and see us here as well, and join in this fantastic energy that tonight was just filled with. So hopefully we'll do more of these as time progresses.
Travis: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Laura: Thank you, Loot Crate!
Matt: Thank you Loot Crate for supporting us and being so awesome, being a fantastic sponsor, and yeah, I guess, is it Thursday yet? We'll see you guys in a couple weeks.

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons! Tonight's going to be an interesting episode, but before we get to that, a couple of quick announcements and a couple of cool things we wanted to show you. One, our friend of the show, Kiki, who we saw previously made the awesome Fenthras bow replica for Laura over there recently decided to go ahead and also create Cabal's Ruin. Taliesin, do you want to come over here and try this on?
Taliesin: No, I'm getting into that.
Marisha: It is on your body.
Matt: Come attune to this shit, boy!
Marisha: Go sit in the corner with it for 30 minutes.
Liam: Put it on. Oh my god.
Travis: Stand in front of this table. Stand in front of this camera. No one can see you over there. Why are you getting totally naked?
Liam: It looks just like Tom Cruise's!
Travis: Stand over here!
Matt: Go over there.
Taliesin: Where?
Travis: In front of the table, you dicklord! Yes!
Sam: Someone get a camera on this guy.
Taliesin: I don't know which camera is--
Travis: Put your butt against this table! Kneel down, Taliesin!
Marisha: Taliesin, you work in film and TV. You know how this works! Get behind where we are.
Laura: No, he wants to be right there.
Taliesin: I know. (laughs)
Liam: Oh my goodness.
Taliesin: Our plan's going to go so well.
Matt: And she also made a fantastic replica of Whisper, the blade that was previously attuned by our dear rogue. Will you pass that over to Liam?
Travis: And will you hold up that mini?
Laura: You get to have that because you took two Vestiges.
Travis: This amazing mini was done by Eric Blumkiss-- I'm sure I'm messing up the name-- from Sweden. It's an incredible Grog mini that's so detailed and amazing, and I had to have it, so I promised our firstborn child to him.
Laura: Oh, good times.
Matt: That might make an appearance tonight as a proxy Grog for battle.
Taliesin: I would break everything on the way back here.
Matt: And also, since it was recently Sam's birthday.
Sam: What? A present for me? On stream?
Matt: It's from me and Marisha.
Taliesin: Happy pineapple day.
Sam: Oh, this is so exciting. What did I get? It's a great gift! Shirt-ception!
Marisha: Yay!
Sam: Part four!
Marisha: Must keep it going!
Sam: (yells) Oh man! This is the best gift! It's the gift that keeps giving.
Travis: The four of them stacked are pretty fucking incredible.
Marisha: I know, I think you've aged through the process.
Sam: Yeah. I'm going to take a picture of me. Someone can put that on a shirt. Oh man, this is amazing.
Matt: We are slowly folding into infinity. Sam's shirts will be the end of all existence.
Sam: That's so great. That's my favorite gift I've ever gotten.
Liam: That's what's inside the black spinning marble underneath Whitestone.
Sam: Oh man. Thank you, guys. That's so sweet.
Matt: Happy birthday, Sam.
Marisha: So sweet.
Matt: All right, announcements for the evening. First off, our fantastic sponsor Loot Crate is back. Sam, do you have anything?
Sam: I prepared a history lesson tonight. It's a history of crates. Ancient Greece: Zeus presents a lovely crate to the first woman on earth, a lovely gal named Pandora. It contained death and evil, corrupted the world forevermore. Egypt: 1957, the Ark of the Covenant-- sort of a crate; it carried the Ten Commandments-- is opened by Colonel Dietrich and Dr. Rene Belloq. Ghosts fly out, and it melts the faces of several Nazis, while Indiana Jones hides his face. Los Angeles, California, 1995: Rookie detective David Mills, played by Brad Pitt, receives a cardboard crate from murder suspect John Doe! It contains the head of his girlfriend, Gwyneth Paltrow. Your town, present day: you receive a small, expertly constructed crate that contains geek chic gear and apparel from The Walking Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween! Now, which would you rather get? The Ark of the Covenant? Pandora's box? A box with Gwyneth Paltrow's head in it? Or a Loot Crate, which you can use code CriticalRole to get 10% off your monthly crate. Guys, I think there's only one choice.
Marisha: That might be my favorite one. That might be my favorite one you've done. That was good.
Liam: We've got to slow you down or Loot Crate is going to poach you for ads.
Sam: That would be fine! I would much rather do these! I would do these for money every day! (laughter)
Matt: Curses! Thank you, Sam. And thank you, Loot Crate. Head up: me and Taliesin will be flying out tomorrow to be attending a convention this weekend called Another Anime Convention. Another Anime Con is in New Hampshire--
Liam: Florida.
Marisha: Boston.
Matt: No! I looked it up.
Marisha: You're not sure.
Matt: (giggles) We'll be doing panels and signings and all kinds of other fun stuff this weekend, so please come and say hi, ask questions, bring things to get signed. Come meet us; we would love to see you. It'll be a lot of fun. Also, Marisha, you have a new Signal Boost run coming up you want to talk about?
Marisha: Oh yes! We're doing a Halloween special edition. Two runs, starting Tuesday, and we're bringing back all the hosts! Taliesin and I are the first episode, and I know you guys love us, so for everyone who's like, "I'm not watching anymore because Taliesin's not the host anymore!" Now you should watch again.
Taliesin: I'm back. What are you going to do?
Marisha: You're good at the spooky stuff. You basically built our list. It was amazing. It's all good stuff.
Matt: Liam, you had a new project you want to talk about, as well?
Liam: Yes. I am continuing to be Doctor Strange in various Marvel animated things, and on digital HD, they've got a new animated feature called Marvel's Hulk: Where Monsters Dwell, and I am still the sorcerer supreme, where I say things like "eye of Tamagotchi" and "sphere of Esperanto" and other such spells. Check it out.
Laura: I'm in that.
Liam: Are you?
Laura: I'm in that with you.
Liam: Can you say who you are? Who are you?
Travis: How about no. Probably not.
Matt: The glory hosts of Hogwarts.
Laura: You'll hear me.
Liam: My name was in a press release. Laura will play some confident kickass someone or other. Like you do.
Laura: Whoa, that was double ones!
Matt: Good, you got them out of the way! Stop rolling, Laura. Save it for the battle.
Sam: Battle? Wait, we're going to battle?
Travis: Yeah, rap-battle.
Matt: I guess it depends. All right, so! Now that our announcements are out of the way, tension builds--
Laura: No! Gears of War came out this week!
Matt: Let's go ahead and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back. So! Picking up where we left off, Vox Machina, in their journey to destroy the Chroma Conclave, a gathering of chromatic dragons that have torn through the Tal'Dorei countryside and taken up residence and calling it their domain, they've defeated Umbrasyl. They have their sights set on the next series of dragons. In the process of setting up a timeline in which they had to bait the white dragon Vorugal in the ravine outside of the ruins of Draconia, hopefully to jump on and destroy the dragon. They were approached in Whitestone by an individual that apparently was not Seeker Assum, an ally of theirs from long ago. Instead it was one of the dragons of the Conclave: Raishan, the green dragon, who had come to parley and actually offer an alliance, seemingly unhappy with the current set of rules and lack of interest from Thordak in making up his side of the bargain which was struck. Raishan has asked for your aid in destroying the swollen, dangerous red dragon. You guys asked, as a showing of faith, to have Raishan come with you to the ruins of Draconia, gather the Ravenites, and destroy Vorugal alongside you. As such, you gathered Lady Kima as an ally in this endeavor. You transported yourselves to the snow- and ice-covered ravine. Just now have taken up in Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion, and are laying down for an evening's rest. So. As you guys wake up the next morning, or before you do--
Laura: No.
Sam: We don't sleep?
Marisha: We don't sleep?
Laura: No.
Sam: Why're you waking me up?
Laura: Because I was thinking, maybe it's a bad idea to go jumping into this tomorrow. Don't you think maybe we should wait a day?
Sam: Sure?
Laura: I mean, we could watch Vorugal, see what's going on, see what his behavior is, and also prepare a little bit more with the Ravenites. But, that happening, you might have to inform them that he's not actually going to have a--
Sam: An attack?
Laura: Tomorrow.
Sam: But we literally just got back from telling them to be ready to move tomorrow morning.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: Percy, how are you feeling? You know, he seems all right.
Laura: No, he would have extra day to recover! Percy's not himself yet.
Taliesin: I am sleeping in the corner, I would assume.
Travis: He does look a little weak, even for his standards.
Marisha: A little pale.
Laura: I just don't think it's the best idea to jump into this.
Travis: (burps loudly)
Sam: So we have to go back and tell them--
Liam: Literally just got back.
Sam: And they were pissed. They were super pissed that we were there. We could go back.
Laura: Do you go back in the morning or do you go back now?
Marisha: I feel like time is of the essence here. Probably not best to wait until morning.
Sam: Tooma is not going to be pleased.
Marisha: Look, she already hates us.
Sam: That's true.
Travis: Yeah. Can't get any worse.
Liam: It could.
Travis: What, we're freeing them from a dragon. We are bearers of good tidings.
Marisha: Are we?
Travis: Yeah!
Marisha: (groans)
Travis: Now do we totally trust Tooma and the Ravenites? Do we want to give her all the details or just that we're going to be checking it out for one day more before we ring the dinner bell?
Sam: What are the details?
Travis: Well, if we have an extra day, what does that get us?
Marisha: We can maybe try and get Pike.
Travis: Ooh.
Marisha: Gives us an extra day for Pike.
Travis: How do we do that?
Sam: I don't know.
Marisha: I can go get her, theoretically, if we have an extra day.
Travis: Which I think we do. But I think we need you here, right?
Marisha: She does have the stone, right? She does have the stone? I think she has the stone.
Laura: Yeah, she has the stone.
Marisha: Okay.
Travis: We're going to be setting a trap, right?
Laura: Yes.
Travis: So maybe we make that trap more better?
Laura: What exactly did you tell Tooma was going to happen?
Sam: Be ready to attack tomorrow morning. We're going to deliver a giant beast for the dragon to hunt, and that her people should be ready to strike. That's it.
Laura: Did you tell her to tell Vorugal anything in particular?
Liam: No, but we don't know if she has or not. They've got their necks on the line. I know they're not to be trusted, but they're in a precarious position, as well.
Marisha: Well, we don't want to necessarily have them jump in right away. We want them to set Vorugal on Yenk, correct?
Laura: Yes. Shouldn't she inform Vorugal that the monster is coming?
Marisha: Glorified messengers at this point.
Travis: Who's Yenk?
Laura: The big monster that we're setting for him.
Marisha: The goristro.
Travis: What's that? He's like a ram?
Laura: Yeah, a giant ram. Haven't you seen the picture? Did you see the picture?
Travis: No. I'm the only one that really appreciates pictures, and I haven't seen it.
Marisha: Oh, that's unfortunate.
Laura: I'll go grab the book from Percy as he's sleeping.
Taliesin: Roll for it!
Sam: You don't get to say roll!
Laura: You don't get to say roll for it!
Liam: I've said that, and he's ignored me, so you don't get to say shit!
Taliesin: Matt! Dad, make her roll for it!
Matt: For?
Laura: I'm just trying the big book of beasts away from Percy as he's sleeping.
Sam: He's not sleeping on it, is he?
Taliesin: It's in my possession.
Matt: Make a perception check with disadvantage.
Taliesin: All right. That'll do.
Travis: Say it so confidently.
Laura: Subtract some, because you're still really tired from being dead!
Taliesin: That's disadvantage.
Matt: And minus two on both of these rolls.
Taliesin: Oh, and minus two. That's 14.
Matt: Yeah, she slips it off you.
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: This is what you see.
Laura: That's what we see, Grog!
Travis: Wait. Is that like this, is it like me?
Sam: We don't know! We haven't seen this thing.
Matt: It's clustered around a bunch of other art pieces of other demonic-looking entities, and it is by and large about twice to four times the size of anything else on the page depicted.
Travis: That's really big.
Marisha: Two Grogs? Is it like two Grogs?
Matt: There's no picture of Grog in there. You have no sense of scale.
Sam: Quick! Draw a picture of Grog, and then we'll know.
Travis: I'll draw it full scale! I put my hand on the page.
Laura: Oh, he's tiny!
Travis: Yeah, I think he's hand-held. Maybe we need like a few Yenks. Everyone can do with a few Yenks. (laughter)
Liam: Jeez. We're all about to die tomorrow or the day after.
Travis: Wait! Vax and Scanlan, when you're within, did you see Vorugal in your travels?
Sam: No, we kept out of sight in the caverns and Vorugal we don't think saw us, but we also didn't see Vorugal, either.
Travis: Do you think you could replicate your path in the daylight?
Laura: I think he would see them. What if you became a fly or something and flew down? Would he notice you?
Sam: Wouldn't see me. I don't want to speak for Vax, but if we're going back tonight, you no longer have the ability to fly, is that true? But you do, Vexy?
Laura: I do. And I can speak Draconic.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Well, that would've been helpful last time, actually.
Laura: Sorry. I didn't think about that last time.
Sam: But yes, if I were a fly-- I assume any of us can avoid his detection if we stay low and invisible. Well, yes.
Laura: All right.
Sam: Right?
Laura: Can you make me invisible?
Marisha: I can't. He can.
Sam: I can make you invisible.
Travis: Are we going to go now, or are we going in the morning?
Laura: We'll pop down tonight to talk to her one more time.
Travis: All right.
Marisha: So you're telling them?
Laura: Hold off a day. She's going to be so pissed.
Marisha: Are we going to go back and see them again? Okay, we'll just say: next morning, then you go say, "hey, we got an awesome thing for you." Okay.
Travis: Yeah. If we're summoning a few good Yenks, do we have a spot that we want to say stay away from?
Marisha: Well, they gave us a location of the stones.
Sam: She told us to release Yenk--
Travis: Oh, on the summoning stones.
Sam: The summoning circle or something like that. All right?
Travis: I've got to go pee.
Liam: Also, when we were there, we weren't allowed to bring any weapons in, so you're going to have to dump--
Laura: Nothing?!
Sam: I'm leaving mine in the mansion.
Laura: (groans)
Sam: Bring something that you don't mind putting down.
Liam: Yeah, don't bring your best.
Laura: Fenthras.
Sam: No, leave that at home.
Liam: I'll take it. I'm not going to use it; I don't know how! Barely. Woo-hoo!
Laura: Now you've got three Vestiges! Should we go, then? Can you make me invisible and we go?
Sam: I can make you invisible. You can fly us down through the cavern, but you're going to have to be super stealthy.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on us.
Sam: Okay. Don't know how that'll work if we're flying, but okay. Doesn't that cover our tracks? Oh, that's the stealth rolls thing? Okay, good. Wait, Keyleth, will you hold onto my Mythcarver sword for me?
Marisha: Sure!
Sam: I can trust you.
Marisha: Of course! (giggles)
Sam: Oh boy. That's a big smile.
Marisha: You can trust me.
Sam: Okay. Don't kill anyone with it.
Matt: Keyleth finally has a Vestige.
Marisha: I do! I was the last one, you guys! It feels-- doesn't really feel like anything.
Laura: Once you attune it to yourself--
Marisha: Sure.
Liam: Scanlan feels the same way, don't you Scanlan?
Sam: I feel nothing. Sometimes I have to hold it with my left hand so it feels different.
Marisha: I switch hands. (laughter)
Marisha: Still nothing.
Travis: When you call it the stranger--
Matt: So as you cast Pass Without a Trace on yourself and Scanlan, the shadows of the mansion cling to you a little darker, a little more crushed. You wish to cast Invisibility on Vex, you said?
Sam: Yes, I will use yet another 3rd-level Invisibility spell to make us both invisible.
Matt: All right. You both jump onto the back of her broom.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And just to double check here--
Travis: The way he said that--
Laura: No, he said it really terribly.
Matt: What do you mean? I didn't say anything!
Travis: You sure did.
Laura: Sure did!
Matt: I'll say technically you're carrying the broom, so the broom will also be invisible. Okay, so as you're holding the broom, you both leap onto it, the two of you and the broom vanish, and you guys are free to exit the mansion at your disposal.
Sam: Yeah, so we made a right here and left here and right at the big rock.
Laura: Is anybody going to keep track of us like you kept track of Vex-- Vax. I just called my brother me. I just did that.
Sam: Vex is the girl one. Vax is the boy.
Laura: Is somebody going to be around in case something goes horribly wrong?
Liam: I'll go with you if Kiki wants to turn me into a crow or a fly or something. I'll stay back and watch.
Laura: Stay up like Kiki did before.
Marisha: I mean I could do what I did before and follow you as Minxie. Worked last time. I still have my one last shape, as well.
Sam: Isn't Minxie big and spottable?
Marisha: It's a mountain-based tiger. I'm a white snow tiger.
Sam: That's so hot.
Marisha: It's actually very cold in the mountains. That's why they have thick coats.
Travis: You don't think Vorugal is going to think that's a midnight snack?
Marisha: Who, me?
Travis: Yeah, you. Big white tiger?
Marisha: He didn't see me before.
Travis: Oh okay.
Marisha: Let me see something. Hang on, because this'll tell me because Polymorph-- you might go out of my range. Is the only problem.
Sam: Polymorph just lasts. Wait, no.
Matt: Nope, concentration.
Sam: So he has to stay within range.
Marisha: Range is 60 feet.
Matt: No, that's just to cast it. I'm pretty sure he can go off on his own as long as you maintain concentration.
Marisha: Okay. Can I? He can go. Do you want to go? All right. What do you want to be?
Liam: Something white.
Laura: Something very small. Like a moth, a white moth.
Sam: It's got to be something that can go as fast as we're going.
Laura: He can sit on my shoulder. No?
Liam: Yeah, but then if you guys get fucked I'm dead, as well.
Laura: I'll just smack you and then you'll become you again.
Liam: So it'll just be like every day. All right, yeah.
Marisha: It's true.
Laura: Right? If I smack him, it's not going to kill him, he just turns back into--
Sam: If he were a black crow or something he could fly back on its own. A moth can't travel a mile.
Laura: Make him a white crow.
Liam: Yeah, can you make me an albino crow?
Marisha: Sure! I don't see why not.
Sam: With one yellow eye and one black eye.
Travis: Oh get on with it, fuckers! (laughter)
Marisha: I do that. With one yellow eye and one black eye.
Matt: All right. And as your form shifts to the first probably albino crow to wander the landscape here in Wildemount, you are able to follow them, should you so chose.
Marisha: To match Vex, I give him one little blue feather, just off the side. Little blue streak.
Liam: A little bit; this isn't Percy's, but (caws). (laughter)
Taliesin: (caws)
Laura: Come on, let's go. Come on.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: You guys make your way outside into the heavy snowfall, across the top of the ravine. You go ahead and make a survival check to try and follow the tracks of Minxie to the outskirts of where you guys were last time.
Sam: Do I also get to give her any assistance, like "we went this way, go that way?"
Matt: Yeah. You know what, giving you the assist, go ahead and roll with advantage on that.
Travis: Oh, that's lucky.
Sam: Dice jail already?
Laura: Yeah. Definitely already. 17.
Matt: Okay. Takes you a little bit of time, but you manage to find your way back through the heavy snowfall. It's freezing cold and your teeth are starting to chatter a little bit, but you manage to make your way to the top of the ravine, dipping down where you find the cavern entrance at the bottom, leading into where Tooma and rest of the Ravenites at least seem to have the central portion of their society within the mountain itself. You guys come down. It's a little warmer the further into the rock you travel. The snow turns to slush, then to damp ground, to dry rock and stone.
Laura: I get off the broom and put it behind me.
Matt: Okay. Both still walking invisibly, with you now (whoosh) walking behind them, hopping as the white crow.
Sam: We should do the same thing we did last time. I know you weren't here. We turned visible, asked to guards to go-- It's going to be really shitty when we get in there, because she's going to hate us.
Laura: All right. Ow! Fuck you! Stop it!
Sam: I will drop invisibility. Are the guards around?
Matt: You guys are just on the outskirts of the entranceway.
Sam: Oh, we'll stay invisible until we get to the guards.
Matt: To the center of the town, or outside of Tooma's--
Laura: Oh! I thought we were already in the cave.
Matt: You're inside the cave. There's a path in there and it opens up into the actual subterranean village, and then in there, across from this fountain area, is where Tooma's tent is.
Sam: Where did we meet the guards last time?
Matt: As soon as you entered the main village area.
Sam: That's where we want to meet them again.
Matt: So as you both drop your invisibility guise, with your white crow friend hopping behind you, the same two guards are still patrolling. Only one of them notices you. Turns around and gives an odd look, his head cocked to the side as he grabs his spear and puts it towards you again.
Sam: Yep, same routine. We'll leave our weapons here. This is my friend Vex. We'd like to see Tooma again. I know it's very upsetting that we have to make these night calls like this but it's very important.
Laura: I speak in Draconic. I say  Sorry, my friend rambles.
Liam: (hacking spit)
Laura: My broom takes off behind me.
Matt: Yeah, exactly. Vanishes forever. Keeping the spear there, yells out (foreign word), and the other soldier who's wandering, turns around, looks and sees, steps over, puts his spear down, and they both have a conversation briefly. You can, as I recall, speak Draconic and can read lips, is that what it was? Yeah. They're both discussing why these stupid people keep coming back and bothering Tooma, as well as the coming tension of tomorrow's activities, and how they can't keep interrupting Tooma if she's going to be keeping her mind straight. But one of them leaves. The other one steps, circles around, and begins nudging you both forward, telling you in Draconic, "Then go, make it quick."
Laura: We will.
Matt: As you guys stay at the outskirts of Tooma's tent, the interior light has been sufficiently dimmed, as it was before, with a little bit of the embers that are still there in the fire pit in the center. Now, barely cracking ember. Tooma is passed out and curled up inside her throne-like chair, as one of the other dragonborn soldiers comes over and nudges her gently, "Tooma. They return." She rakes towards his face. He barely ducks out of the way. Unnatural speed for a creature as old as she is, per se, but then the hand recoils back with a snapping sound, and she wakes up, "You come again?"
Sam: Yes. We offer profound apologies for waking you from your slumber again.
Matt: Snaps her arm back into place. (cracking)
Laura: In Draconic  we apologize for waking you up. Unfortunately, I sent my brother here before with our compatriot, and he spoke out of turn. We're actually planning the attack the day after tomorrow.
Matt: (sigh, foreign words) Which you recognize as, "Tell the others: wait a day." And one of her servants wanders off behind you guys and exits the tent. She turns back to you. "Then what is to be done?"
Laura: We'll be releasing a very large fiend.
Sam: At the spot where you told us.
Matt: "At the stones, yes."
Laura: The stones. We hope that you will inform Vorugal that it's going to happen. He'll head over, fight-fight-fight. He becomes much weaker, we jump in, fight-fight-fight.
Matt: "It'll be done. Do not mess this up."
Sam: Question, before we go. Typically when you've done this in the past, you inform Vorugal and he heads on over right away? Does he need to see evidence of a hunt? How does it work? Do you typically inform him?
Matt: "I do not inform. Skork does the informing."
Sam: Skork?
Laura: Yes, Skork. I remember him.
Sam: And is there some sort of hunt horn or anything that signals the beginning of this, or does it just happen?
Matt: "Depending on where the prey is, whether it be nearby forests or presented in chains to the cinder stones of which I've sent you, Vorugal begins the chase."
Laura: He won't be in chains, exactly. Is that all right?
Matt: "Just keep it there."
Laura: Oh, okay.
Sam: I don't want to mess this up. If Vorugal were to see anyone near this summoning circle, would he be suspicious, or would he be okay with it?
Matt: "If it is not a Ravenite, it would probably make them part of the hunt."
Sam: Okay. Good to know.
Laura: Good news. Good. Great.
Matt: "Is that all?"
Laura: That's all. Be pleased. We will see you in a couple of days.
Sam: There's like a 50/50 chance we'll come back again tonight.
Laura: No it's not. We're not.
Sam: No? 60/40.
Laura: Let's just go.
Sam: We're out of here.
Matt: "Leave me!"
Sam: Sorry.
Laura: Again, I apologize for my brother. He's an idiot.
Matt: She doesn't even pay you guys any mind, just curls over, takes her heavy robes and like wraps them around her and curls up into a small little bundle of old dragonborn woman. The rest of the soldiers close in, cutting you off from her, and they all give you the very stern look that you have seen many times that tells you, "get the fuck out."
Laura: Okay. You make us invisible?
Sam: Oh yeah, invisibility yet again. I'm out of 3rd-level spells.
Laura: Is Pass Without a Trace still active on us? It's up to an hour.
Matt: Yeah it'd still be active.
Liam: As they're leaving, not wanting to get left out, I fly down from the air and land in my sister's hair and like a cat (growls) into the top of her head five or seven or 12 times.
Laura: Thank you.
Liam: (caws)
Marisha: So tangled.
Matt: Instantaneous bedhead. You can't even see it, but you can feel it and it bothers you. All right. You guys both are invisible, the bird clutching to your side. You take the broom back up into the snowy storm. I need you both to make stealth checks with advantage.
Laura: I thought we were invisible. We're invisible.
Sam: Yes, I've made us invisible again.
Liam: Big bonus.
Laura: Okay, stealth checks.
Sam: With advantage?
Laura: Plus ten to whatever you roll.
Sam: Oh snap! 12, 22--
Laura: 36.
Sam: 24.
Matt: All right. You guys make your way up out of the ravine, up onto the top of the snowy banks at the top of where the cliffsides are. Eventually, over the next 20 or so minutes, finding the shimmering outskirts of Scanlan's doorway, joining the rest of the party.
Laura: Get the fuck off my head, you piece of shit.
Matt: Polymorph lasts for how long?
Marisha: An hour.
Matt: As soon as you get to the top of ravine, the white crow (impact) face-down in the snow.
Marisha: I think it's an hour.
Liam: Speaking of which  hold still, there's a little bit of bird shit right there.
Laura: Aw, I thought you were serious.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: Thankfully, that doesn't transform, either. (laughter)
Matt: You make your way back into Scanlan's mansion.
Marisha: While they were gone, I, with Fenthras and Whisper, was playing make-believe archer Vex, like a 12-year-old in the bedroom with a Nerf bow.
Matt: As you enter the front of Scanlan's mansion, you see Keyleth in the corner, who's pulled Whisper back in Fenthras, and it goes (dagger impact) into the wall.
Marisha: It worked! How did it go, guys?
Laura: Give me the bow, right now.
Travis: Oh, busted.
Marisha: It might be like a cool combo move.
Laura: I'll think about it. Thank you.
Travis: She take it well?
Laura: She did! She said she'd wait.
Sam: She's a night person. She's okay.
Travis: Great.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You did catch on the way up, Vex, that even through the dark sleet-covered snow blaring night, there is the faint hint of light blue sunrise in the distance.
Laura: Oh shit. Day's coming. We didn't sleep! We need to sleep!
Travis: Wait! Should we see if we can get Pike first?
Sam: First? Do we have any spells to do that?
Marisha: I can try and scry.
Laura: What if you take the stone, pop over to her, then use Tree Stride and come back?
Marisha: That I can do, yeah.
Sam: You have another Tree Stride in you? Didn't we get here today?
Marisha: We did, but if I burn a higher-level spell, then yeah. What does it matter, at this point?
Travis: Yeah, let's get all our ducks in a row.
Marisha: All right. I'll be right back. See you guys in a minute.
Liam: Bye! A minute passes.
Marisha: A minute passes. This is like when you walk the same direction, you say bye, and then you walk the same direction to the car.
Matt: Awkward quiet. You hear Kima snoring with her back against the foyer wall, just (snoring). Until eventually, the stone begins to glow and pulse like a dull frozen heartbeat. (pulsing) Keyleth, your eyes open, and you see it flashing in your hands again, and you look up real fast and before you can say anything, your mouth opens to say goodbye before she vanishes in a swirl of glitter and blue light.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: Now, Pike! Come sit down! (cheering)
Ashley: Hello!
Marisha: I like your jacket! It's really great.
Ashley: Oh hi! Okay.
Matt: Just flew in.
Ashley: Yeah. Here we go. (laughter)
Matt: So. As the day has gone by and through the chaos of getting Whitestone ready, trying to assemble the followers of Sarenrae that you've gathered, and protecting the remnants of the city as Vox Machina went off, a moment hits you and you close your eyes and pray to Sarenrae and hope that all shall be well with your friends, and you wish that you could be there to help them. And there's a sudden warmth in your proximity, and then a sudden flash of blue light, and then nearby, you see a somewhat cold, damp Keyleth just appear in the space next to you as you're preparing to lay yourself down for an evening's rest, it being later at night now, clutching the stone.
Ashley: Hey! I was just about to go to bed!
Marisha: Were you sleeping? This is so awkward!
Ashley: I was just saying my prayers.
Marisha: Oh my gosh.
Ashley: I do it as much as I can.
Marisha: You know, I never thought about having poor timing with these gate stones. I'm so sorry!
Ashley: (stammers)
Marisha: I thought you were on the toilet.
Ashley: I know. I'm so glad I wasn't.
Marisha: Yeah, me too.
Ashley: I'm so glad you're here.
Marisha: I missed you.
Ashley: I missed you.
Sam: We saw her literally today.
Marisha: Yeah, but it seems like I went around the world and back!
Ashley: I was thinking today and I was like, "Oh man, I should've just gone with them."
Marisha: Yeah, we got all the way there and we were like, "oh, we forgot Pike!"
Ashley: I know. It's okay.
Marisha: Do you want to go?
Ashley: Or I will be there now. Let's go.
Marisha: We can go now.
Ashley: Let's do it.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Is that a new set of dice?
Ashley: I had to go buy some because I left all of my stuff in New York. Let's see how this goes.
Sam: You stopped on the way here to buy dice?
Ashley: No, I got those a little earlier. We're okay. We're here. Okay.
Marisha: Okay. So we Tree Stride back.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you gather your materials, your armor, your weapons. All things that you feel would be necessary for this type of a conflict. You rejoin with Keyleth. The two of you find your way back to the Sun Tree.
Marisha: Right. So yeah, so the leader of Ravenites, her name is Tooma, and we went there, and we were talking to her, and I think we have a plan, but not really a plan, so we're going to figure it out as we go. All right? Let's go. That's the plan; you're caught up.
Ashley: Okay, great. Hey, guys. (laughter)
Matt: So as the spell finishes, the Sun Tree opens, you step through the portal into the slow crawling sunrise. The sun hasn't quite crested, but you can see through the snowfall, which is lessening at the moment, the distant light blue is getting lighter and lighter. You probably have another 30 minutes before the sun hits the actual horizon line. But as you step out of one of the trees that you created previous, when you had journeyed to the ruins of Draconia, you do see about 150 feet off, the shimmer of the outside of Scanlan's mansion door.
Marisha: (whispers) Let's be quiet, okay? Let's do this.
Sam: Oh, great. Pike's good at quiet.
Marisha: We stealth there.
Matt: Both you guys roll stealth checks.
Sam: Oh Jesus.
Liam: This is so great. Now we can all die together!
Matt: You have disadvantage, Pike.
Marisha: Oh, that's a natural one.
Sam: Wait, what?
Ashley: I don't think I can get worse than that; that is a one.
Sam: Two natural ones?
Matt: Two natural ones?
Marisha: No!
Sam: Oh my god. The dragon's going to fucking kill us right now.
Marisha: Oh my god, Pike. The plan hasn't even started!
Laura: Dice jail!
Liam: We're all about to lie down for a three-hour nap. What are you talking about?
Ashley: Off to a great start.
Matt: As you guys begin stepping through the snow, Pike, you take a step and you hear this strange (cracking) sound and you feel this slight shift beneath your feet. And you watch as some snow begins to trickle off the side of the cliffside.
Marisha: Pike?
Ashley: I'm going to not move.
Marisha: I don't move, either. Do we not move or do we run?
Ashley: We should run. We should run because it's probably coming down!
Marisha: Run! (laughter)
Matt: As soon as you both push off running, (whoosh) a portion of the cliff actually shears off and begins to slide down the side. Pike, if you could go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw real fast.
Laura: Oh my god, Matt! Why are you trying to kill her right when she gets here?!
Sam: Yeah, Matt. Why did you roll two natural ones?
Ashley: Wait, what did you say it is?
Travis: A dexterity saving throw.
Matt: A dexterity saving throw.
Ashley: Wait, I get nothing, okay. A four.
Matt: A four. You begin to see Pike slide down off the edge.
Marisha: I cast Grasping Vine to grab onto her.
Matt: With that, some of the reeds, some of the nearby frozen plants on the edge that were largely covered with snow that were revealed as the rest of the snow began to crumble off, a large vine shoots out, wraps around you, and pulls you back up onto the side of the cliff: fine. The rest of the rock and snow and ice, you hear (crashing) clattering into the ravine below.
Ashley: Go!
Marisha: Go!
Matt: All right, you guys run. You see the doorway shimmering before you, you get closer and you hear in the distance, this strangely familiar distant echoing (growls).
Ashley: Aw, come on! What is that noise?
Marisha: Go, run!
Matt: You both just get to the doorway in time. The snowfall's still there though gentler than it was in the night. You both dart inside, slamming the mansion door behind you, into a warmer, comfortable, quieter atmosphere. (panting)
Ashley: Hey!
Laura: What just happened?
Liam: Jeepers.
Travis: Hey!
Ashley: Hey!
Travis: Hey, buddy! Why are you out of breath?
Liam: You all right? You look white as a ghost.
Taliesin: Have I had a full night's sleep, at this point?
Matt: No, not yet.
Taliesin: Goddamn it.
Marisha: Dragon might know we're here.
Travis: What, why?
Marisha: Well, there might've been a rockslide. And it might've been our fault. I'm not sure.
Travis: You just walked through a tree. Why was there a rockslide?
Marisha: I don't know, Grog!
Liam: The door is easy to see.
Sam: The door is shimmery and shiny?
Matt: No, nobody can see through it.
Marisha: They can see a shimmering door.
Matt: Only if you let them. Only individuals that you choose can see the entrance.
Laura: That's great!
Ashley: So whatever that was just saw us disappear.
Laura: Oh shit! Grog! Open the door! Dust of Tracelessness! Out the door! Right now!
Travis: Oh! Yeah, I open the front door and I take big handful of the Dust of Tracelessness and I (whack).
Matt: Okay, make a strength check. There's a mild wind here you're fighting against with dust, so we'll see.
Travis: 14.
Matt: 14? Okay. You take a big old heaping handful and (whoosh) another one. As you send it out there, all the snow crusts over and any signs of footprints, both half-elf or gnomish, turn into a gentle, untouched solid surface of snow, as you begin to hear in the distance another echoing (growl).
Travis: What is that?
Ashley: What is that?
Laura: Close the door.
Sam: Close the door.
Laura: Close the door, Grog!
Travis: I just want to see what it is!
Ashley: I slam it shut with my gauntlets.
Travis: Hey, pushy!
Ashley: We don't know what that was! Well, maybe you do, but I don't know.
Marisha: I'm assuming that was Vorugal.
Sam: The dragon.
Travis: It's a dragon.
Ashley: It's a dragon!
Travis: Yeah, a big white dragon.
Marisha: Big white. Big dummy dragon.
Travis: And you let it know we're here! (chuckles)
Ashley: Well, that was an accident. I was going to surprise you guys. And we almost died.
Travis: But hey, we're not, so we need to get some sleep, right?
Sam: Yes, everyone sleep now.
Travis: We sleep.
Matt: Okay. You guys all go to rest?
Travis: Yes.
Matt: All right. A full rest is taken for all of you. Everyone's healed back to full. Spells are recovered. Percy, you are now down to a minus two, I believe, penalty to your rolls.
Liam: Wake up and it's two in the afternoon?
Matt: Technically, yeah. It's mid-afternoon by the time you guys finish your full rest, except for Percy. Percy is up before everybody else and is pacing about the mansion by himself probably.
Sam: The mansion will last 24 hours, so it'll be dark again by the time it wears off, so we can stay in here as long as we need to.
Liam: All right.
Sam: But do we have things we need to accomplish today?
Taliesin: How about making a quiet cavern, not too far away from the summoning circle, where we can hide?
Laura: That might be smart, actually.
Marisha: At the pace in which that cliff fell apart last night, I don't know about the structure of the topography here.
Taliesin: That's fair.
Laura: But we're also up high and the ravine is down low. That could make a difference.
Liam: Yeah, we could get piled on.
Laura: Oh! I understand.
Sam: But with Percival's engineering skills, he could maybe find a good little spot of granite for you to dig into or something.
Marisha: I can try and do a Commune With Nature and see.
Travis: These islands float, right?
Matt: Oh, they once did. All the islands of Draconia were disabled, the arcane essence that let them stay up, and they all crashed into the ravine.
Liam: Also, when shit goes down, we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the past. A) we don't want to teleport inside the dragon's belly.
Sam: I'm keeping all options on the table.
Travis: Only stupid people do that.
Liam: Clearly. B) We don't all want to be all grouped together.
Laura: We don't want that.
Liam: I'm eating one of these magic candies.
Laura: Those chicken candies?
Liam: Yes, there's chicken. We want to spread out so we're not all blasted at the same time.
Taliesin: Vex and I at a distance.
Liam: Separately, though, so you can hit from different angles.
Travis: So two caves? Four caves?
Marisha: I'll have to think on the caves.
Sam: They don't have to be giant caverns. It's just a little nook. A little foxhole.
Liam: Cubby-holes. Up high for anyone who can take to the air, down low for anyone who can't.
Marisha: Honestly, I'm not going to know a whole lot until we scout out the location.
Taliesin: Let's go scout out the location.
Sam: Okay, how do we do that? In broad daylight.
Marisha: I've got something I've never done before!
Laura: What is this?
Sam: It's called Invisible Reconnaissance.
Marisha: Almost. It's called Animal Shapes. And it's basically Polymorph, but for all of us. I can turn us all into whatever we want.
Laura: So we don't just look like cows.
Laura: We are cows.
Marisha: We are cows.
Travis: Quick question. In all of our time here, when we were scouting before, and when you two jokers were going to go see Tooma, did we see a bunch of animals around?
Laura: I have not seen very many animals, I don't think.
Matt: Within the ravine, there's been very few. What animals you have seen have been a few flying owls, other carnivorous birds that are generally scavengers. You've seen maybe a few small wolves that are picking through the ruins and eventually scattered off. White snow wolves.
Travis: As long as being animals isn't going to make us a mid-day snack, versus being Ravenites.
Sam: I will say this  I love the sound of this spell, but wouldn't travelling mist be really undetectable? Could we mist around?
Marisha: It's almost debatable. Because we look like an unnatural mist.
Sam: There's a snowstorm out there. We're just going to be one with the clouds.
Laura: Is there a snowstorm?
Matt: If you guys glance outside of the mansion and look, it is not a snowstorm, but there are heavy winds. (wind blowing) You can hear multitudes, a cacophony of off-harmonies of winds, of different portions of the distant ravine that are all howling together. There is a faint snowfall, but the clouds are dark and heavy, and more of a storm coming your way.
Laura: Does snow get thrown up to the wind?
Matt: A little further down in the ravine, it does.
Liam: And as long as we're not synchronized swimming in mist form and spread out, then it should be fine.
Laura: Behave like wind, you guys.
Travis: Can we do both animals and the mist?
Matt: No, they both require concentration.
Sam: My worry about animals is don't we also have the intellect of the animals that we become?
Matt: Actually, Wind Walk is not concentration. In theory, you could do both. Wind Walk is not concentration.
Marisha: We can be misty animals?
Matt: You can be misty animals.
Marisha: That's dumb. (laughter)
Marisha: That's a lot.
Sam: So we keep our own intellect?
Marisha: We always keep our intellect. Animal Shapes last for 24 hours.
Taliesin: Can you go back and forth?
Marisha: I'm going to find that out right now.
Taliesin: That's a question.
Marisha: Because if we were a flock of birds, Vorugal's not going to give a shit about birds.
Sam: A flock of hawks, they don't go together. But a flock of pigeons do, or a flock of geese.
Taliesin: I don't want to be food. I want to be something that eats.
Liam: While they're debating, I pull Whisper out, and I chuck it into a wall and teleport to it. I pulled it out of the Blink-Back Belt.
Matt: Yeah. So you chuck the dagger. As you're talking, you watch as Vax takes the blade, flings it across the room. It slams into the side of the foyer. You look back to where he was, and he's not there anymore. There's a flash of dark shadow energy where the blade is, and Vax's form appears right there, holding the blade where it landed in the wall.
Laura: That is so cool!
Liam: It didn't go into my belt. I went into the wall, and I'm holding it, still. I was a shadow for half a second, and I traveled with the blade. I am fucking Nightcrawler. Holy shit. And I throw it again across the other side.
Matt: Okay. This time make an attack roll because you're excited, not concentrating.
Liam: Okay. Sure, that's 27.
Matt: Yeah. It goes a little more elevated, lands about ten feet up. As it impacts, you guys watch. As he releases the blade, his form almost is pulled along, almost like it's caught on a tether and then just turns into dark smoke and vanishes with the blade. As the blade sticks into the wall, he reappears at the side, clutching the edge, and you drop a few feet and land onto your feet.
Liam: Aw, suck it haters! This is the coolest dagger I've ever had!
Sam: Tell me this, can you not do that? If you throw it and don't want to travel where it is?
Liam: I throw it right next to his head, and I don't go anywhere.
Matt: Roll an attack roll.
Sam: Go right in my neck.
Liam: 24?
Matt: 24. (dagger impact) Right next to him.
Liam: Does it go to my belt?
Matt: It returns to your belt.
Sam: Oh! You get to choose?
Marisha: That is awesome.
Sam: Maybe don't ever do that again, please.
Laura: Sure you're okay, Grog, that you don't have the dagger? I know you wanted it.
Travis: I just want to be able to move faster, but it's all right.
Liam: We can't all be all things, Grog. You are the strongest thing on the planet. You are going to take Vorugal all by yourself--
Travis: Yeah, if I can get next to him.
Laura: Which he probably can't.
Liam: You shut the fuck up, you trouble-maker. You bust my balls on a daily basis. What is that about? What is that about? What have I ever done but support you?
Travis: Pipe down! Calm down! Listen, how are we getting down there? Can we hurry this up, please?
Liam: Throw my dagger at the ceiling. Travel with it.
Matt: All right, so you watch his form vanish again. About 40 feet up, (impact).
Liam: Can I land on my sister?
Laura: On me?!
Matt: Make a dexterity saving throw. This would be acrobatics, right.
Laura: What about me?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: I was looking straight at him.
Liam: I rolled a 27.
Laura: Perception? 20.
Matt: You make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: (sighs) You piece of shit.
Liam: Quit starting with me.
Laura: Dexterity. 28! 30!
Liam: 30. She beat me.
Matt: She dodges right out of the way, and you slam onto the ground. You feel your ankles and knees (ping) a little bit. That sharp pain hits you in both joints and you're like (moans).
Liam: Worth it. (groans)
Marisha: So anyway. Back to the plan-- (laughter)
Marisha: So with Animal Shapes, I can actually decide what animals each of you can be, so we can all be different animals. Furthermore, on my action, I can use it to transform you guys into a different creature.
Laura: That's pretty cool.
Liam: I like how excited you are about this.
Marisha: I'm so excited.
Laura: I'm wondering if the mist form would not be better. But the animals are really cool.
Taliesin: Can we go in and out of mist form? That's a thing we can do?
Sam: It takes a while, but yes.
Liam: But we're not in the middle of a fight, hopefully. The animals, Kiki, save it for a rainy day?
Marisha: All right.
Laura: If we're not all dead come tomorrow.
Liam: Yeah, we probably all will be dead tomorrow, but it's a really cool idea.
Marisha: Thank you for your validation.
Sam: Two questions. Are we all going? And question two, when we get there and find a suitable location for carving caves, are you going to do this right now, or are we just scouting?
Taliesin: We're going to do this, as well.
Sam: We're going to do this right now?
Marisha: I imagine it depends on how scouting goes.
Sam: Well, we can't communicate when we're in mist form, so you just have to go do if you feel it.
Laura: Maybe scout and then go back. Because mist form stays for eight hours, so at least that way we can communicate not next to Vorugal.
Taliesin: If we scout and it's clear, and then we come back and then go back, it might not be clear again. If we scout and it's clear, then we do it. It's done.
Matt: You guys hear this faint gargling sound as Grog is currently gargling his own spit and staring at the ceiling.
Liam: I didn't follow that, either. We should do something.
Marisha: All right, let's go scout. I cast Wind Walk on everybody.
Matt: Okay. All of you begin to feel your form buzz a little bit with the instilled power of wind. As you all each step out onto the snow on the outside of the mansion, you can concentrate for a moment as your form then meshes into a mist-like billowing cloud.
Laura: Do we look natural?
Sam: Yeah, what do we look like?
Laura: Do we look pretty obvious?
Sam: Are we a yellow cloud, a white cloud?
Matt: I'd say it's more of a whitish cloud. I wouldn't say it's supremely obvious right now, but the wind is pushing you about a little bit. If you try and focus direction of move, you can get a better idea how well your movement is.
Taliesin: I'm trying to move in a very windy way, yeah.
Travis: And Kima is with us?
Matt: Kima is with you, yeah.
Liam: I am the fart.
Taliesin: I am the fart.
Matt: Kima, as you guys are doing this and it gets cast, Kima goes, "So what am I doing?"
Marisha: Do you want to come scout? We're going to scout. Or you can just stay.
Matt: "You know, I'm going to stay. You've got a big kitchen here."
Marisha: It's mainly filled with chicken.
Matt: "I love chicken." (laughter)
Travis: There's also a training room several levels down if you want to go smash some shit.
Matt: "I'm going to get some chicken, and I'm going to go smash some shit."
Marisha: And there's the spa under that.
Matt: "I don't think I've been to a spa. Does that also have chicken?"
Laura: It could if you wanted it to.
Ashley: You could bring it down there.
Matt: "This is the best place ever!"
Sam: It is. It really is.
Matt: "Come back when you need me." She goes and runs off to the kitchen area. All right. You guys, stepping out, keeping the focus on the spell, you move half-speed through this weather in mist form. So your 300 feet per round speed, whatever it is, is reduced to a mere 150 feet.
Marisha: It's okay. It's more for appearance.
Matt: What are you guys doing? Are you coasting through the ravine, are you heading directly, or trying to go overhead?
Marisha: I want to go to the summoning stone. I'm going towards there.
Sam: But we discussed before we left that we would mainly stick to the lowlands and the ravine to get there, yeah?
Laura: Yes, we did.
Taliesin: Hugging the walls, looking normal.
Marisha: Sure. I follow the crowd.
Matt: Okay. Who's leading?
Ashley: I am! (laughter)
Laura: I'll lead the way.
Liam: This is the quietest you've ever been.
Taliesin: I volunteer as tribute!
Sam: Shouldn't Laura lead?
Taliesin: Let Laura lead.
Matt: Okay. So Vex and Pike are leading the way.
Ashley: No, I was kidding.
Taliesin: Too late. No take-backs.
Travis: We all die together.
Matt: As you guys slowly drift down into the bottom of the ravine on the outside of where the mansion doorway is, you crest down to where a large portion of the rubble is currently buried by snow and ice. The wind is whipping snow up into the air, and you're finding little spirals and little snow devils that are making their way through as different clusters of wind tend to swell and subside. You make your way over to the opposite side of the ravine and start heading to the north way, crawling around.
Laura: I'm going to keep an eye out to make sure nobody seems like they're-- especially towards Vorugal's plateau to make sure he's not there.
Matt: Need you to go ahead and make a perception check if you could. And I need everybody to make a stealth check, please.
Marisha: Do we get some sort of bonus because we're mist?
Laura: Perception is 30.
Marisha: Jesus.
Ashley: How can you be loud as mist?
Liam: Natural 20!
Marisha: Stealth and what?
Taliesin: Just stealth for us.
Sam: Do I get to add Jack of all--
Matt: You can. As long as you're not trained in it, you can add it to it.
Sam: I'm not. Okay. 18.
Taliesin: 16.
Marisha: 14.
Matt: 20.
Laura: 15.
Ashley: Eight.
Travis: Four.
Matt: Okay. It's fine. It's a group check, so successes outweigh the failures. You guys as a group begin to move forward. It's fine. As you guys are slowly moving your way, you keep an eye out. You can see there are some Ravenites in clusters that are out, currently poring through the rubble. There are crews that are basically excavating, trying to pull out what's worth anything from the remnants of Draconia. You make your way around this large, familiar curvature from before that leads towards the center area of Vorugal's now-claimed lair at the bottom of the ravine. As you turn the corner and you guys keep watch, you can see on the icy platform, with these spikes that jut out at various places throughout this larger central area here. On top, you can see perched and curled up the massive form of the white dragon itself, claws curled up under its chin, its chin slightly turned askew to the left, eyes closed, wings wrapped up around and gently flapping over the sides of the top of this icy platform. It sits there quietly, breathing in, and you can hear the breath itself, deep and guttural, just echoing. (snoring) The wind occasionally sneaks in and seems to almost carry the echo farther than it should be audible. And you can see there are two packs of about five Ravenites that are armed and are sitting at the base of the platform, that are looking out. Some of them are sitting, some of them are eating some small rations, some are just keeping an eye out. These appear to be essentially assigned guards to Vorugal here at his lair. So. You guys continue past?
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Matt: Heading which direction?
Laura: Towards the summoning circle.
Matt: You recall which direction that was?
Liam: It's east.
Matt: All right, so you head a little northward, following the curvature of this part of the ravine in an eastward direction. Eventually, you all move past an uncomfortable proximity of about 200 to 300 feet of Vorugal, seemingly not catching anyone's attention as you slowly move, following the pattern of winds. It takes you a little longer to get through, but you figure it's best to look as natural as possible with the moving terrain and weather. Eventually, you turn around and begin making your way eastward, away, following where two more portions of the ravine clump together. Anywhere between 80 to 100 feet in width, it expands a bit, shrinks in a bit, but it seems to be pushing into a very slight grade upward, like this portion of the ravine is making its way, over probably the next mile or so, to breach and hit surface.
Liam: So from Vorugal?
Matt: From Vorugal, heading eastward, it is slowly heading up. You get about a quarter-mile in before you begin to see the very thick ice being broken by occasional snow-covered dead trees that are breaking through. As you saw before, there are not a lot of trees in this central area of the ravine, but they're becoming a little more common as you progress forward, though many of them dead, thin and broken in places. Make another perception check, Laura.
Laura: Okay. 16.
Matt: Okay. It's fine. Pushing forward in your mist form, you do see that certain portions of the upper ravine have an element of erosion to them that have broken down, and there are some large stones that have dropped and are jutting out of the ice formation on the snowy platform floor. You glance around, and you can see that there are a loose circle of maybe five, six stones forming an oval shape in the center. And even looking about, you can see this area seems to have seen some scuffles. It looks like portions of the walls have been scraped and clawed apart. It looks like some heavy impacts have hit the side. If there was a place for there to be a setting ground for some sort of a conflict of previous hunts for Vorugal, this is probably what Tooma was referring to.
Laura: I look down towards it. Does it look like anything is around it?
Matt: Currently, no. It looks pretty--
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Ooh.
Laura: Oh no! Tree's down!
Liam: It's an earthquake. The trees fell down! Keyleth! Your spells are too powerful!
Marisha: (laughs) I can save them! I can save them all!
Sam: Wow, Matt.
Ashley: It's so pretty!
Laura: It is so pretty.
Matt: This circle of stones here--
Ashley: Did you make the--
Sam: It's Arendelle!
Liam: He's been carving it this week.
Matt: So this circle of stones, the clusters of rock that have broken down and are sticking out, you don't know what the cultural significance of them are. They appear to have been there for a long time; these were not a recent series of landmarks that were presented here. These have been here for a while. But you do see a series of claw marks and damaged bits throughout the space in the area that is uncharacteristic of the rest of the ravine floor that you've been traversing.
Sam: Can Vorugal see this spot?
Liam: Curved away?
Matt: You make a perception check, Scanlan.
Sam: Oh, I'm great at those.
Liam: We just traveled about a half-mile?
Sam: Six!
Matt: About a quarter mile. You don't see Vorugal from here, so probably not.
Laura: I would be looking for Vorugal too, though.
Matt: Perception check.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: From this perspective, it's a little ways in the way the ravine has crawled in this northeastern direction from where the lair center was. This area is not directly visible from Vorugal. You cannot see, for quite a bit, that area.
Liam: Wind fingers for Vorugal.
Laura: All right. Can I float down and get a closer look at the weird marks you were talking about?
Matt: Yeah. Make an investigation check.
Sam: While she's doing that, I'm going to fly through Pike a few times.
Laura: 13.
Matt: It tickles. But not in a good way. Glancing about, you can see there is some snowfall here and some ice that has sealed off this area. A lot of the snow that's hit here gets blown away by the wind that's coming through, so there hasn't been a lot of snow packed in this vicinity. A lot of these large claw marks are indicative of dragon claws, especially those of an ancient size. You do see bones scattered about-- many of them have been picked clean-- of varying sizes. There appears to be a half-eaten large insect-like carapace that's shoved off to the side. A number of creatures have fallen here and have been mostly eaten, devoured, or left to be picked apart by the other birds of prey that exist in this area.
Taliesin: We have cover from either side of the top. That's right. I'm going to fly over to the top of the far right of the ravine.
Laura: Behind those rocks right there?
Taliesin: Above them, all the way up here. And I'm going to take a look around and see if anybody, anything's around, anything living that looks suspicious.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: You'd think I'd be able to do this. 18.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, you can see every now and then, a few birds fly overhead. Appear to be hawks, light gray in color. They're just looking around, circling and vanishing in the distance. You do see a few small furred critters; looks almost squirrel-like, but it's too far away to make out the details, and you're not very specifically detailed-- make a nature check, actually.
Liam: Check for critters.
Taliesin: Nine.
Matt: You have no idea. It's furred, it's small. It probably creeps you out a little.
Marisha: (giggles) My friends.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to survey. Would I think it's safer above the ravine or within?
Matt: I'd say within here, it's probably safer within the ravine, up at the top. This is not indicative of the true height; we'll say this is more of an example. The ravine height is probably closer to maybe 80 to 100 feet up.
Travis: Yeah. Got it.
Matt: I just didn't want to build Styrofoam that high.
Taliesin: Actually, that works out perfectly for me. Then I'll jump down to behind that rock and I will de-mist behind that rock.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: I'll see him doing that and join him.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll watch as they do that.
Taliesin: I think a cave entrance right here to somewhere where you can hide after you do the summoning and dive in and get about 25 to 30 feet away.
Sam: Question, Percy. There's this annoying wind. (laughter)
Liam: Vax flies around them.
Taliesin: I'm not responsible for what you ate for breakfast.
Sam: Here's a question. Rather than scouting here, digging a hole, and going back to our mansion, should we just have a new mansion here?
Taliesin: Yes, that's actually-- well. Kima.
Sam: Kima.
Taliesin: That's all right. Somebody can mist back and bring her.
Sam: I could technically drop that mansion and she'd be on her ass. (laughs)
Taliesin: I think she's already so delighted with you. That might be a terrible idea.
Sam: Well, someone could go back and get her. We don't have to do this right now, but when we're done here, maybe we want to camp here so we have a place to hide inside a mansion.
Taliesin: That's a very good idea, actually.
Sam: And we don't even really need to make tunnels, do we?
Taliesin: We do. We want to have places to hide.
Sam: Yeah, that's true. We want to spread out.
Marisha: I'm going to mist down next to them.
Taliesin: We want to have a place to hide, and place to shoot from that has cover.
Marisha: Hey, guys. What are we talking about?
Taliesin: Digging a hole and moving the mansion here.
Marisha: (laughs) God, so windy tonight.
Sam: I know, it's so annoying.
Taliesin: It also means that if something goes horribly wrong, you can run downstairs and hide.
Marisha: All right, well, here's the problem. I need to figure out what all of this is made out of. I can't work with it if it's just ice. It has to be natural stone. So cover for me? I'm going to drop down and start meditating.
Sam: I'm going to scan the sky.
Marisha: I'm going to do a Commune With Nature spell. Do we have any other questions, before I do this, that we want to ask the land?
Travis: We're wind; you're good.
Matt: Everything seems fine.
Laura: We're still wind.
Marisha: In general, I guess.
Taliesin: How strong are the ravine walls, and can we dig into them, as well? Not just the ground, but the walls themselves. Small tunnels, just big enough for one person.
Sam: And there's these rocks here. We know there's some rocks. We knows that there's tons of ice.
Marisha: Do I need to figure out how far exactly Vorugal is from us?
Sam: We saw him on the way over. We know exactly where he is.
Marisha: I have three good questions.
Liam: Weather forecast is not a bad idea.
Marisha: No, it's not. The weather forecast.
Taliesin: Yeah, for tomorrow.
Sam: What sorts of things can you ask nature?
Marisha: Nature-y things. I can ask it about--
Liam: Where's the closest Erewhon?
Marisha: Yeah. Is there a Starbucks nearby?
Matt: Three questions. What you got?
Marisha: Oh, I was asking-- yeah. I can ask it about topography, I can ask about locations of people nearby. Things like that.
Laura: Ask about what the rock is, so you can find where to dig.
Taliesin: And where's the green dragon.
Marisha: Oh, that's a good idea. Where the fuck is Raishan? Okay.
Laura: She might be with us right now.
Marisha: She might be. Okay. Now I do this.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: First and foremost, what is the geological makeup of this land around me? This ravine. Cliffside.
Matt: What is the geological makeup?
Marisha: What is it made out of, yeah.
Matt: Stone.
Marisha: And all of this stuff on the edges?
Matt: All of this is stone with about a foot layer of ice on the outside of it. Portions of it that have been broken or struck, you can see some exposure to it. This ravine is not normally covered in snow and ice; Vorugal's presence has brought a persistent blizzard and icy atmosphere to it. So all the ice and snow you see here is technically not natural to the terrain, and most of this ravine has a very strong foundation of solid stone, natural rock, and other various geological layers beneath.
Marisha: So it is fairly sturdy and not apparently going to collapse at any moment?
Matt: Correct. It appears like what happened with you and Pike earlier was an anomaly that only happens when you roll two natural ones.
Marisha: Sure. Okay. Can I get a sense on what the weather is going to be like for the next 24 hours?
Matt: Reaching out to the vicinity and picking up what you can, it's hard to get specifics, but it looks to be at least a coming sleet storm. Not hail; nothing too heavy, but it looks like it's going to have some times of limited visibility, and very cold.
Marisha: Bummer. Okay. Good to know. And do I sense Raishan?
Matt: Within three miles? You get the essence of the surrounding terrain that there is another large dragon presence nearby, though you don't get a specific location.
Marisha: Bummer.
Taliesin: It was a good thought.
Sam: No, that's good to know.
Marisha: She's within three miles.
Laura: She's here, or it's Thordak.
Marisha: Well, no, he's said another, aside from Thordak.
Liam: Aside from Vorugal.
Matt: No, you asked for Raishan. Raishan was confirmed to be within the vicinity.
Marisha: Okay. That's it. Those are my three questions.
Matt: As that question fades, you do get a little better bit of location of Raishan's current presence. Raishan is currently on the very south end of the ravine, on the outskirts of the three-mile radius of near where you are right now. Close to where you guys first came to the ruins of Draconia, where you were first discovered by the Ravenites. That's all you know about her. Just that location.
Marisha: Close to the ruins of Draconia?
Matt: Where you guys first arrived when you first came here.
Liam: Not near us right now.
Marisha: And not where the library and the ruins of Draconia were.
Matt: Yeah. South of all that.
Taliesin: All right. I like the idea of someone going back to get Kima. I think one tunnel on this side, one tunnel on the other side, and one tunnel on the top of the ravine on either side, if you can do that.
Marisha: And do we want them to connect so we can get through? Little half loops, semi-circles?
Sam: Does this make noise? Will it vibrate the ground?
Marisha: I'm pushing out earth. Yeah.
Taliesin: Not a ton of noise.
Marisha: Vex and I mentioned that.
Taliesin: How loud will this be, do you think?
Marisha: How loud will this be?
Matt: As loud as moving large pieces of stone and earth would.
Travis: Loud.
Matt: Not stealthy work.
Sam: We saw a storm coming. Has it hit yet?
Matt: No, you've got a few more hours.
Sam: We can wait until the storm comes. It'll be super windy and loud.
Travis: Not nearly enough to move tunnels of earth and rock.
Sam: Can you do something to ice? Melt it? That's silent.
Marisha: Yeah, but it's only a foot of ice.
Sam: Yeah, but we could carve out ice tunnels.
Liam: No, the ice is only a foot thick, coating what is normally a temperate region.
Travis: We got the house. We got the mansion. That's it.
Liam: But it's one spot.
Sam: We can hide behind rocks.
Marisha: We could do a test.
Sam: Can you make new rocks that are hollow? I guess it'll still make noise.
Marisha: I could make walls of stone. I can make little-- But also keep in mind, anything that I do, he'll notice. And the whole point to this is to not make our presence known at all.
Laura: And ice dragons burrow. I remember that much.
Marisha: So we could pop in our tunnels and they could be like, "what's up?"
Sam: How important are these tunnels? Because if we want, while you're doing this I can go distract the dragon?
Marisha: On the other end of the ravine?
Sam: Sure, why not?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: No.
Travis: Why would you do that?
Sam: To distract the dragon so you can dig.
Liam: Because we can use your mansion, and when the time is right, we can all scatter in different directions quickly. Many of us can fly. I would rather have these cubby-holes, as well, but it's too risky, and it's too risky to let you go running your little ass off around and get that dragon to eat you in one bite. You're overruled.
Travis: How do we go get Kima?
Laura: Somebody that can turn invisible has to go get her.
Marisha: Well, you're still mist-form. That lasts for eight hours. You can mist back.
Laura: Yeah, but she can't turn into mist, so you can go get her and turn her into mist.
Sam: We have the stones. What about the stones? Stones. Someone can mist back with the stone, then mist back to us and give her the stone.
Liam: Yeah.
Taliesin: That'll work.
Ashley: I'll do it!
Sam: Ooh!
Travis: Wait! Does the stone make any sound or light?
Taliesin: No, just goes poof.
Travis: Really? Then sure.
Taliesin: Little bit of a poof.
Laura: It's a little bit of light, but we can hide behind something when she does it. She can poof from within the mansion before you make the mansion.
Travis: She can poof from within the mansion.
Taliesin: You can't poof within the mansion.
Matt: You can't poof within the mansion. It has to be on the same plane of existence.
Laura: But it's daylight, so it should be fine.
Marisha: The mansion's considered a pocket plane.
Sam: If Pike is going back as mist-- no offense, Pike-- can you find the mansion?
Laura: Why don't you go with her?
Sam: Okay. Gladly.
Ashley: Oh, okay. You'll know your mansion better.
Travis: Send the two bitties. And we're going to hide out. I'm still in my mist form.
Sam: Did you guys de-mist-ify?
Laura: Well, we've been talking, so I'm going to say yes.
Sam: Hey, clever elves, can you scout around, make sure we're not being watched?
Liam: There are no elves here. My mother was a human. Do you want to go right now?
Laura: I've been keeping an eye out, but yes, I will keep watch.
Sam: We're not being watched? You sure those hawks are hawks?
Laura: Is anything watching us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 28.
Matt: 28? Looking about, there are a number of birds in the distance. There's some that have flown overhead since you've been here. Nothing that seems to be acting erratically or out of the ordinary. There's a couple that have come in a little close to watch, and then went off their own way, curious as to what's going down in the ravine.
Liam: Those are some birds.
Laura: I think we should all be mist, though, while we wait for them to get back. Just in case.
Taliesin: I'm going to spend some time in this form just studying to see if there's anything odd about this circle at all. Studying the stones.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Where is the circle? Oh. Thank you.
Matt: Right, so Pike and Scanlan, you guys go mist form, make your way over back towards where the mansion was placed. Takes you a while. Are you going through the ravine, or are you going over the ravine?
Ashley: Over.
Matt: Okay. So the two of you guys coast up to the side and over the top of the wall. There is some heavy dead forest area here, but you coast on the side of it, keeping an eye down. Both of you guys make a perception check.
Sam: Terrible. 11.
Liam: Ashley's got this.
Ashley: 21.
Sam: Ooh, my girl!
Matt: As you guys are pulling around and the weather has gotten a little better for the moment; the storm hasn't hit yet. Pike, you glance off and you can see some stirring down in the bottom of the ravine. You see two white wings (wingbeats) and you watch as Vorugal takes off like a bat out of hell up out of the ravine, past both of you, and you can feel the wind shake and the actual ravine quakes slightly at the presence as Vorugal shoots up into the air, spirals up, then wings go out and then coasts off westward, away from you guys.
Marisha: Oh, away from us?
Matt: Away from you guys in a western direction.
Ashley: Away from them, too?
Liam: Away from us.
Marisha: He's going west.
Liam: We're east.
Ashley: So you guys are fine.
Taliesin: Wait.
Ashley: I try to make wide eyes.
Marisha: (gasps) Does this mean we can dig?
Laura: Did we see him go in the air from where we are?
Matt: Make a perception check, actually, Vex.
Ashley: We should take his loot.
Travis: (laughs) Yeah. That ends well.
Laura: 20.
Matt: You do hear what sounds like heavy wings echoing through the ravine towards your direction. You see a faint movement in the sky, and then it vanishes and you hear the sound getting more and more distant. You gather Vorugal has at least left the lair. You're not sure how long.
Laura: I come out of mist form. Vorugal's not here right now. If you're going to dig, do it. I'll keep an eye on the sky.
Marisha: What do you guys think, should I do it? Over the earpiece.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: I think we should.
Travis: No.
Taliesin: I think two crow's nests for the shooters.
Laura: Do it quickly, if you're going to do something.
Taliesin: I draw out, really quickly in the snow--
Laura: I draw out an intricate map. Blueprints.
Matt: Meanwhile, Scanlan and Pike, you guys make your way back to the mansion? Coasting over, you find your way. You make your way into the mansion. The servants are rushing two platters out of the kitchen down to the stairs that lead to the subterranean portion of the mansion.
Sam: Okay. Kima, sorry to interrupt lunch--
Matt: You come downstairs and her armor is off, her maul's at the side. She is on the ground in the process of doing one-handed push-ups and scarfing chicken with the other hand. She's getting ready for a fight today.
Sam: Disgusting.
Ashley: That's amazing!
Matt: She stands up. "Damn right, it is. Stringy."
Ashley: We came back for you because he's going to build a mansion somewhere else.
Sam: We need to move.
Matt: "Okay." She takes one of the pieces of chicken and pockets it.
Sam: That will disappear when we leave here.
Matt: (groans) Pulls it out. Sucks it off the bone and throws it to the ground. It clatters off to the side. "All right, let me grab my stuff." And she goes and gets her armor and starts putting it on. "Do you want to help me?"
Ashley: To hold some stuff?
Matt: "Put the armor on! You know to put on plate. Come on." You help get her armor on.
Sam: Do you need me to help, as well?
Matt: "No!" You help her get all armored up. She gets the rest of her stuff. She came relatively light, other than the materials she needs for combat. She's ready to go in the next 15 minutes or so. "All right. So. Where's this going down?"
Sam: I produce one half of the stones that we brought, and I say-- oh wait, does she know how to do this? I guess you just think, right? You just think. You have to think. I know that's hard, but you're going to have to hold this rock and want it to be reunited with its pair. I'm sorry about that. And then you'll be bamfed back to where we're going, all right? Here, take this stone. All right, so we'll just step out of the mansion. I won't drop it yet, because there's no need.
Matt: All right.
Sam: And we're going to mist back, but after she's bamfed. All right. So think happy thoughts, click your heels together.
Matt: Steps out in the snow, crunching sound of her boots, closes her eyes for a second, opens one back at you, Scanlan. Focuses and concentrates. The minute progresses. She clutches it and touches the actual stone to the outside of her holy symbol. You see the small platinum outline of Bahamut's head. As it hits, it begins to glow. The blue glow is also surrounded by the bright white glow of Bahamut's light, and as her outer form begins to shimmer, it blinks out with a spiral of a glittery white light dust, and her form has vanished.
Ashley: She's the coolest.
Sam: She's okay.
Ashley: She was doing one-handed push-ups and eating chicken in the other.
Sam: Can you do a one-handed push-up?
Ashley: Yeah.
Sam: Can I see?
Ashley: Yeah. (laughter)
Matt: And with those gauntlets, she does easily, fully armored and all. She's leaving this little Pike shape in the snow right there.
Sam: Can I try a one-handed push-up?
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: Seven. (laughter)
Matt: (grunts) Two-handed push-up.
Travis: On his knees.
Sam: I'm carrying a lot of stuff. Without my gear, I could probably do it.
Ashley: I understand. You're also carrying a mansion or something.
Sam: Yeah. Magic weighs on you.
Ashley: Magic weighs a lot.
Sam: All right, let's go.
Matt: All right. You guys mist back, begin cresting over to return.
Sam: Scanning the skies for any sight of a flapping white dragon.
Matt: Okay. While that's happening, what are you guys doing?
Taliesin: I'm making ice plates.
Laura: I'm keeping an eye out for Vorugal or anything suspicious.
Marisha: I guess I'm making tunnels.
Matt: Using Move Earth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Let me see here. Move Earth is you can reshape any dirt, sand, or clay in the area. Not stone.
Taliesin: Not stone?
Matt: Cannot manipulate natural stone or stone constructions.
Travis: Or a budget rental center. (laughing)
Laura: So you can make walls.
Taliesin: Can you manipulate ice?
Sam: She can manipulate ice.
Taliesin: Can you manipulate ice?
Marisha: I can melt ice.
Taliesin: But you can't create ice.
Laura: Even if she did, it has to be something not noticeable.
Taliesin: I think that we could--
Marisha: I can make some more plant life.
Matt: Do you have Stone Shape prepared?
Taliesin: Stone Shape?
Marisha: No.
Matt: Yeah, Stone Shape would've been the spell to use in this circumstance.
Marisha: Cool.
Taliesin: If we pull some of the ice, I can try and make sheets of ice--
Marisha: But how long does Stone Shape last? I thought it was just for a little bit.
Matt: Stone Shape is instantaneous. It just affects something.
Marisha: I know, but how much? It's only like a five foot cube, right? So I can't make a tunnel.
Matt: Not a heavy tunnel, no.
Marisha: Right, so no.
Taliesin: We can alter the topography just a bit by taking out some of the ice and then opening it up to make hiding places.
Marisha: I can make a little trench, like a trench wall-line for you guys at the top of the ravine, for the shooters.
Liam: Yeah, half-bubbles almost.
Marisha: Yes, exactly.
Travis: 80 to 100 feet up, right.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Laura: Yeah, I can shoot from that height.
Marisha: Right along the ledge.
Laura: Actually, after you do it, I can try to disguise it, so it's not seeable from the air.
Matt: Okay, so what are you doing? You're making a small ledge?
Marisha: So yeah, I'm going to do Wall of Stone. Fuck.
Taliesin: We don't need a ton of space, because we're never going to move more than six.
Marisha: Yeah, I basically want a little almost half wall for cover here and here, just extending the stonework.
Matt: Just out this way?
Marisha: Upwards. So that they can--
Matt: Oh, okay, I see.
Taliesin: Give us cover.
Marisha: Do the Gears of War.
Travis: Can I raise a point, Taliesin? Do you have anything to keep you from falling if he attacks you on that ravine?
Taliesin: It would be hard to fall if he attacks us. The best thing, actually, if he attacks us up there would be to jump.
Matt: So you're using it twice? Then over here, you said?
Marisha: You know what, let me flank it. Let me do one on that side and one over here. Yeah? You think?
Sam: Why a hundred feet up?
Travis: That's how tall the ravine is.
Sam: Can we just do 20 feet up?
Taliesin: You have a broom. I have a rope.
Marisha: Is this excessive?
Sam: Yeah! Why a hundred feet? Why not 20 feet? Why not 30 feet?
Laura: We can't do it in the middle of the stone. We have to do it at the top.
Sam: Why?
Matt: You could, technically.
Marisha: I guess I could, actually, because I can do a flat one. Okay. All right. You know what, I could make little pod bubbles for you guys on the half edge of the cliffs.
Taliesin: Make some pod bubbles.
Marisha: I'll do that.
Travis: Aren't those going to be obvious?
Taliesin: I'm going to start pouring water on this stuff, and it's going to be ice again so quickly.
Marisha: Yeah, if we try and camouflage it. Spend the rest of the day camouflaging it.
Taliesin: I've already started working on camouflage--
Marisha: The DM keeps looking at us like we're crazy.
Matt: I'm trying to figure this out, guys.
Marisha: All right. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to make (stammers) little balconies.
Liam: Spit some lyrics, girl.
Marisha: (giggles) So smooth. Yeah, little balcony ledges that they can go on.
Matt: Okay. We'll say...
Laura: He's like, "I spent a really long time carving this shit, you guys, and you're going to be altering it."
Matt: It's all good.
Liam: Is there any point to having you sharpshoot from behind that wall down below?
Matt: So right there is what you're saying? A little shelf.
Marisha: Yeah, little ledge. Yeah, a balcony. I want to make a cliff balcony.
Matt: How far up?
Taliesin: I would take it to the far edge. Even further.
Liam: If we're fighting, I'm not bound by shit, man. I can be anywhere.
Matt: Where do you want this to go, Marisha? Right there?
Marisha: One there, and one-- yeah.
Matt: Okay, so those are the two.
Marisha: And about what, 40 feet up? 50 feet up?
Taliesin: I'd say about 50 feet up.
Marisha: How about halfway up the mountain? I want to make it look rough, I want to try and camouflage it, and then I'm also going to help Percy and the rest of this excavation to use my Gust and little Create Water spells over top of it to start covering them with ice.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm creating a breakable ice shield for when it's time, but I'm just giving the nice cover.
Marisha: Yeah, cover it with ice to make it look like the rest.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and just roll a wisdom check. Roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: He normally only asks me that when we're making a terrible plan.
Taliesin: I know. Ooh! Check out the big brain!
Marisha: Check out the big brains on Brad! 23.
Matt: Okay. As an Air Ashari, you have a very firm understanding of airflow, temperature of air, and how best it can quickly freeze water. Over time, utilizing the spells at your disposal, over the next 30 minutes or so, you do manage to coat the visible recently created stone with a layer of ice that in some regard would help, hopefully, camouflage it.
Marisha: Oh, he let us do it!
Taliesin: I'm just going to spend all my time also trying to keep hiding it, keep reinforcing it. Once the mansion's available, I'm going to take water and slowly add layers.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan and Pike, you guys do manage to return, as you watch the party preparing these small little ledges outside of the ravine interior.
Sam: Hey, guys. Did you see the dragon leave?
Laura: I saw him fly away, yeah.
Sam: Should we be concerned at all?
Laura: That what? He's going to get help?
Liam: Well, maybe.
Sam: That he's going to meet up with Raishan? And fuck us?
Marisha: He was heading west, right?
Taliesin: Which is not the direction where Raishan is.
Marisha: Raishan was south. She was far south.
Travis: Can you do your detect dragons thing?
Laura: I guess. Yeah, I can.
Matt: Kima, at this point, by the way, has been off to the side, keeping watch, goes, "You guys expecting anyone?"
Sam: Oh shit.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Matt: You see Kima drops the maul to the ground and points down. And you see, stepping up from the ravine from this side, this way, you see a small, stout-looking dwarf character walking up (footfalls). Bulbous red nose. You can see a thick winter coat over, cloth tied over the top of the head, a crossbow to one side. Walks up and goes, "Hey. Larkin, the one you hired. The mercenary to help you with this exchange."
Sam: We hired somebody?
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: When was this?
Laura: Back in Whitestone. We hired somebody to come help us fight.
Sam: We did? Why on earth would we do that? We're super strong.
Marisha: I kick Scanlan a little bit.
Sam: Oh shit. Sorry.
Matt: "So. Glad we've all gotten together. I see you've begun your plans, so tell me. What is your plan?"
Marisha: Larkin, was it?
Matt: "Larkin, aye."
Laura: Larkin, do you have any spells you can use?
Matt: "I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, aye. Let's see how it pans out."
Ashley: I'm going to talk to him in Dwarvish, and I'm going to ask where he's from.
Matt: Okay, you ask him where he's from? "I don't feel comfortable speaking our language in front of people who don't understand it. It's impolite."
Marisha: She's good.
Laura: It is quite impolite.
Matt: Watch as Larkin's expression gets very dire for a second like, "what are you doing?"
Laura: I whisper to Pike.
Travis: Larkin, are you ready to help us kill a dragon?
Matt: "That's what you hired me for, isn't it?"
Travis: Aye. Don't you think dragons are just the biggest dick-fucks ever?
Matt: "To be honest, yes."
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Oh! Oh, Larkin!
Laura: Just fucking got it?
Sam: Oh, yes! I totally remember you, Larkin!
Marisha: I kick Scanlan again, for sheer joy this time.
Taliesin: We're setting up camp. The attack begins tomorrow morning. There's going to be a beast. There will be a fight.
Liam: Yeah. We kind of have a plan, but fucking dragons.
Taliesin: We'll see how it goes. We're going to try and tire him out.
Matt: "All right. I'll keep an eye."
Taliesin: Once he's tired out--
Matt: "So I'll go on your signal, then?"
Sam: Will you be joining us here at the battle or providing support from afar?
Matt: "I'll be providing support from a comfortable space."
Sam: What kind of support? Long-distance attacks or healing?
Liam: What's your style?
Matt: "Oh. Let's just say, in the beginning I'll go ahead and bring some pain from a distance and only close that distance when things get real nasty and hot."
Sam: And Larkin, the reason we hired you, now that I remember, was for your extreme knowledge of dragons and their behaviors. Tell me this: should we be concerned when this one leaves his lair about hobbling its lair or somehow preventing it from returning?
Matt: "Do you know when it's returning?"
Travis: No.
Sam: Well, we know that it'll be coming here for a fight.
Matt: "If you don't know when it's returning, don't step into its lair."
Sam: Is there a way to prevent it from getting back to its lair?
Matt: "Killing it."
Travis: Real simple answer, I think.
Taliesin: It's not like a vampire.
Matt: Kima leans into you Scanlan, "Who's this?"
Sam: Mercenary.
Marisha: Larkin.
Laura: We hired him.
Travis: Yeah, he's a real dead-eye.
Taliesin: There's also going to be a field of--
Sam: Ravenites.
Laura: Potentially.
Liam: Yeah. Told you it was complicated, yeah?
Matt: Kima crosses her arms for a second. "You also told me you had another ally coming."
Sam: We did?
Taliesin: We did?
Taliesin: I wasn't there.
Sam: Who?
Travis: We have a hard time keeping track of everyone that we hire and fire.
Taliesin: That's why it's going to be a great plan.
Sam: You know why? We have Pike! That's our other ally. She's here now.
Ashley: Here I am.
Matt: "I'm so confused right now."
Travis: Yeah, it's all right. Listen, all you've got to do is smash dragon with us tomorrow, yeah?
Matt: "Which dragon?"
Travis: The white one.
Laura: The white one that's here. That will be here.
Liam: The only one that's here.
Taliesin: Let's make the mansion right now. Please make the mansion.
Sam: I'll make the mansion behind a rock outcropping. Kima, I need your help to make sure I'm not spotted while I do this ritual.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: So this is great. Tomorrow, you pop in, you summon, we all pop back into the mansion. We're hiding in the mansion while the fight's going on.
Sam: Well, someone has to be on the outside watching to find out what's happening.
Laura: Right.
Marisha: Should we have someone near where the dragon is, so we can get eyes?
Sam: Someone who can be invisible, someone who can be a hawk or Ravenite?
Liam: Scanlan, what are you going to do? You going to pop this thing out and then hop in the mansion?
Sam: Tomorrow, we're talking about? Yes, absolutely!
Laura: So Keyleth could be a hawk over by Vorugal--
Marisha: Watching?
Laura: Is there any way to let us know, though?
Taliesin: Not if we're in the mansion.
Marisha: Yeah, because the earrings don't work through the mansion, right?
Matt: From the inside to out, no. They have to be in the same plane.
Sam: Well, someone would have to be next to the doorway, pop their head in and say, oi, it's on. But we also have these bubbles of watching around, don't we?
Taliesin: Which would be you and I before the fight.
Sam: Or I can just drop the mansion.
Marisha: Well, the mansion could be good if things go terribly wrong.
Liam: That's true. If the mansion door is open and hidden behind that outcropping of rock there, you leave the door open but behind it, Keyleth could take to the sky, I could find somewhere low and be hidden. I can dart inside. I can be inside in a second.
Sam: And at the very least, Kima can be waiting inside the mansion, as can our lesser stealthy friend Pike. At least keep them in there.
Laura: Yeah. Sounds great.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: It's a plan.
Sam: It's something.
Taliesin: It's a plan! Anything more complicated would immediately fall apart when anything shifts, which will inevitably happen.
Laura: Actually, can I do Primeval Awareness and search for dragons to see if Vorugal's even in the area at all?
Matt: Sure. As you concentrate, you get a very strong nearby presence.
Marisha: She came in the mansion with us?
Taliesin: No.
Sam: There is no mansion yet. I haven't done it yet.
Marisha: Oh, you haven't done it yet. Never mind.
Matt: And you sense a closing dragon presence. At which point, you hear in the distance (wingbeats).
Taliesin: Mansion.
Laura: Mansion. Right now.
Sam: All right, I will cast the mansion behind a rock.
Laura: And run into it.
Taliesin: We will see you in the morning.
Matt: To?
Travis: Larkin.
Matt: To Larkin? All right. He goes, "Right."
Taliesin: Thank you. Truly.
Laura: Seriously, get in the mansion! Right now.
Matt: You glance off the side, and you can see Larkin looking off into the distance, and the white dragon Vorugal is curling in the air, currently wrestling with something, and then shoots down back into the ravine to the lair.
Marisha: Can I get like a glimpse of it before I run in on what it is? 27.
Matt: 27?
Sam: It's Yenk. (laughter)
Marisha: Damn it!
Matt: What brief view you have, it appears to be, by its size comparison, small-looking, but glancing at it, it looks to be some sort of a dire bear or dire wolf. Some sort of large furred entity that is currently being torn apart mid-air.
Marisha: So it went hunting.
Matt: Apparently. May have been hungry.
Liam: Snack.
Matt: You guys make your way into the mansion for a bit of a respite. Kima carries out the end of it, steps inside. "I don't trust that dwarf."
Taliesin: Excellent. That's why you're here. That's why he's not in here.
Laura: He can't know that you know.
Matt: "Good to know."
Sam: Kima, if it would help, I can erase your memory of this whole thing--
Matt: "You finish that sentence, and I will destroy you where you stand, Scanlan Shorthalt."
Sam: I'll let it alone for now.
Marisha: Good idea.
Matt: "Come near me--"
Taliesin: We wake up early. Before the sun rises, those of us who have to hide, hide. Once we see them bringing him to the summoning circle, we call the beast and we wait. We are going to be in the most danger, because we're going to be right in the thick of it.
Laura: What if he sees you, Percy? I'm better at hiding myself.
Taliesin: We're both going to be hiding in an ice-covered cubby-hole.
Laura: A lot of white.
Taliesin: It's not possible to get to those cubby-holes without a difficult climb, is it?
Laura: I could always bring you up on the broom.
Matt: If you get dropped off by broom, it's easy. Where is the mansion door, again?
Sam: Behind the bigger rock where Percy's stationed right now.
Liam: Yeah, we should wake up before sunlight.
Matt: Guess we'll say, as you guys all vanish from there, the entrance is right there, to the mansion.
Marisha: Who's going to keep an eye on Larkin?
Taliesin: I think it's hilarious that we can think we can.
Sam: Larkin can take care of--
Liam: Also, we've no fucking idea where Raishan is or what she's going to do, if anything.
Taliesin: We know that the one place she isn't is in here.
Laura: Larkin is Raishan. Really?
Travis: Holy shit. I even got that. (laughter)
Laura: You're the last one to realize that?
Travis: You're the last person in this room and on the internet.
Laura: No!
Liam: It's me. I'm the last one. I had no idea.
Sam: Hey, it took me five minutes.
Taliesin: Wow! Oh my god, we're going to die.
Marisha: I knew the second she walked up!
Sam: Ashley figured it out before us.
Ashley: No, she told me.
Matt: As you guys rest to prepare for your next day's excursion, we're going to take a restroom break here.
Liam: It's half of us, Laura! Jeez!
Matt: We'll see you guys back here in a few minutes. [break]
Matt: Welcome back. So! After that brief break, you guys have taken your time in the evening to rest up and get your spells back. Prepared for the coming confrontation, your now one-day delayed confrontation with Vorugal. As your evening comes to a close, the next morning is now before you--
Marisha: Hang on, we weren't done. We weren't done. We have to do things.
Laura: Yeah. One last thing.
Marisha: We have to eat. We have to do the Heroes' Feast, for sure.
Sam: Who's going to do it?
Ashley: I am.
Matt: All right. Pike drops down a Heroes' Feast. 1,000 gold out of your queue.
Laura: That's okay!
Marisha: Worth it, man.
Taliesin: Worth it, man.
Matt: All of you enjoy your first non-chicken related meal within Scanlan's mansion.
Laura: Feels good.
Matt: First in a while, at least. So as part of the Heroes' Feast, guys, if you recall the details of that circumstance.
Sam: Immune to fear.
Matt: Immune to fear, definitely.
Marisha: Saves on wisdom throws.
Matt: Wisdom saving throws have advantage.
Marisha: Also plus 2d10.
Matt: 2d10 to your maximum hit points.
Marisha: And I think that's it.
Matt: And you're immune to diseases. Immune to poison.
Laura: (gasps) You're immune to poison on this?!
Marisha: That's right. Fuck you Raishan.
Sam: Advantage on wisdom saves. Immune to poison.
Matt: All right, so marking hit points. Let me know what your maximum hit point totals increases are, currently.
Sam: Increased 14 points.
Matt: 14 points to Scanlan's maximum hit points.
Taliesin: 17.
Matt: 17 to Percy.
Marisha: An additional 11 to Keyleth.
Matt: 11 to Keyleth.
Liam: 15.
Matt: 15 to Vax.
Laura: I got two tens! I got an additional 20!
Marisha: You got two tens?!
Matt: Pike?
Ashley: I got nine, so that brings me to 97.
Matt: Awesome.
Travis: I got 11.
Matt: 11 to Grog, and then to Kima  eight. Write that down right there.
Marisha: And are we sure we don't want eyes on her? I'm not concerned about her well-being, clearly. I'm concerned on whatever her name she's saying she is right now.
Taliesin: My theory on that subject is that she's clever enough that eyes on her would not be helpful in the first place. It's best to assume that even if we could see her that she would be tricking us over what she's doing.
Sam: Okay and if she starts killing us, what do we do? Hide in the mansion? Regroup?
Taliesin: Hide in the mansion and worst-case scenario, scream that she betrayed us and that she promised that she would help kill the white dragon and see if they'll fight it out.
Liam: Worst-case scenario, we'll pull back towards the mansion if she starts whaling on us.
Taliesin: Yes. And definitely inspire some conflict.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Let's go fight.
Laura: Now we sleep.
Sam: Oh, sleep.
Matt: Your evening meal complete, you all find yourself back to full rest, preparing yourselves for tomorrow's grand showdown.
Taliesin: I'm at negative one.
Matt: You're now negative one to all of your rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Taliesin: Not to damage, though.
Matt: No. Just your d20 rolls.
Liam: You can get all 19s.
Laura: As I am going to sleep, I want to inscribe "sinaeth" on Fenthras.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: What?
Matt: You don't know. Evening's rest complete, spells chosen for those who need to choose spells. Prepare yourselves for this confrontation. The morning comes. That early tension of imminent chaos fills the air. Conversation is short. What preparations do you wish to make this morning?
Taliesin: Vex is going to put me in that pocket.
Laura: Yes. I can't cast Pass Without a Trace on him from that far away.
Taliesin: We have Dust of Tracelessness.
Laura: Yes, but that's only tracks. While we're over there, before I go over to my side, I'm going to try to cover his area with Natural Explorer and try to hide him.
Taliesin: We're going to fly over there, as well. And then also we're attaching a rope, just in case.
Matt: Attaching a rope to?
Taliesin: To the wall, so I have something to climb down with if I need to. It's not going to be hanging out; it's all in.
Matt: Okay, the stone is like a smooth wall that comes out and then upward for the protective point.
Laura: I have climbing gear. You can use it as a grappling hook, maybe. Does that work at all?
Matt: You can fashion something. Make an intelligence check.
Laura: Ten.
Taliesin: Six.
Matt: It seems like it'll hold? You have a metal piece wedged into a part of the stone that seems pretty taut with the rope attached.
Marisha: Can I ask a logistical question? How wide and alive are those trees?
Matt: They are maybe a foot wide each, and currently, it looks like a lot of them are dying or dead from the perpetual snowfall and coverage that they are unused to.
Marisha: So Tree Stride probably wouldn't work on these guys. I'm wondering if I should waste my time.
Matt: Tree Stride. Same size as you. Some of them, maybe.
Marisha: All right.
Sam: Am I making us all Ravenites, or does that not even matter anymore?
Laura: I don't think that matters.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Have we left? Are me and Percy outside already?
Matt: You guys have gone outside if you're going to place him up in his perch there and help cover the area.
Liam: You have to do it, right? Because you're the one releasing this thing.
Sam: I guess if I'm going to be out in the open, I probably should.
Liam: And if you're doing it, does it take any more mojo to do it to all of us or just yourself? It can't hurt to do it to all of us.
Sam: Sure.
Laura: Make us all white Ravenites.
Sam: You mean wearing white clothes?
Laura: Sorry, I meant so we blend into the ice, not so that we're white. That sounded so terrible. I meant so that we're the same color as the ice and we're camouflaged! Like chameleons.
Taliesin: Are there actually enough albino Ravenites that we would stick out, or is that a common color?
Matt: You haven't really encountered any.
Taliesin: Oh, then I would recommend not. I would recommend white clothing.
Matt: You've seen varying shades of chromatic and metallic.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: Snow camouflage.
Taliesin: Snowy.
Matt: Okay. What are you doing?
Sam: I guess I'll make us all white Ravenites. Normal Ravenites with lighter-colored clothing that can maybe blend in. But also we can't dance very well and we clap on the two and the four. So yes, I'll make us all Ravenites.
Matt: Okay. So does that include Kima?
Sam: I can do eight people, so that's everyone, including Kima.
Matt: All right, so you are all currently for the purposes of this visually Ravenites of varying sizes and bulkiness. Okay, is everyone currently out and about right now? Outside of the house?
Sam: I'm going out.
Laura: Who all is leaving?
Sam: Oh wait, before I leave, doesn't someone have to buff me up for this spell?
Marisha: I do. Yep, I do. I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on your charisma.
Laura: How long does that last?
Marisha: An hour. So if we're ready to go?
Sam: Yeah, what time is it? Is it dawn?
Matt: You're not entirely certain. Make a survival check.
Laura: 18.
Sam: Eight.
Matt: You have no idea, Scanlan. It's about noon, from where you gather where the sun would be around that time based on what bits of shadows you can see. However, the sleet storm is starting to kick in, and you can see now the sheets of really cold rain with a slush to them are beginning to pound across the bottom of the ravine. The wind is picking up a bit, and the temperature is dropping significantly.
Laura: Bundle!
Marisha: Yep.
Sam: Okay. How will we know when it's time for me to release? We have to wait for Tooma to go report.
Laura: Is Vorugal back? He's back.
Sam: I assume.
Laura: Do we see Larkin around?
Matt: No, you do not see Larkin around.
Sam: Vax, do you want to go look?
Liam: For Larkin?
Sam: No, fuck Larkin. To see when Tooma's coming. I don't want to release this thing before Tooma is there reporting to Vorugal.
Laura: Well, maybe if we cause enough of a ruckus as soon as we release him.
Liam: I mean if we trust Tooma to hold up her part of the bargain, that dragon is coming here.
Laura: We need to make a lot of noise and then release it. Attract attention, release it, hide.
Sam: But when?
Laura: Whenever we want to.
Sam: No, when is Vorugal coming? We can't sit out here all day waiting.
Laura: Vorugal will come when we make a noise. He'll come over here.
Sam: The Ravenites have to tell him to come here first.
Laura: No, she told him that it's coming, I don't think she's telling him a specific time.
Sam: No, she's telling him now. Today. We told her to wait.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, Vax and Keyleth, you guys notice down off the southern edge of the ravine, you see three humanoid figures walking up to your direction, coasting along the side of the mountain range.
Marisha: Do they appear to be Ravenites?
Matt: After a short time inspecting them, they appear to be Ravenite in structure, yeah. They are dragonborn, they are heavily robed, and they are coasting up along the side.
Marisha: Vex, you want to talk to them? They might have told him. Might have been the ones that just told him.
Laura: I walk over.
Matt: As you acknowledge them and begin to approach, one of them breaks from the two and they stay back. As it approaches you can see the tall burly dragonborn form, this is Skork. You met when you first came to the ruins of Draconia. He approaches. "Tooma sends me. When are we to tell the dragon the hunt is on?"
Marisha: We're ready whenever you are.
Laura: Give us 30 minutes. And then do it.
Matt: "30 minutes. It will be done." He returns to the other two, and they begin to make their way rather briskly back towards the direction of Vorugal's lair.
Taliesin: When you see the dragon pop up into the sky and head this direction, start summoning.
Laura: Percy? Up?
Taliesin: Yes, please.
Laura: All right. I take Percy up top.
Matt: You bring Percy up onto the top. The rain is starting to come down hard now and you're instinctively getting chills and shivering a little bit. You get up into your little parapet area, place him there.
Laura: I try to move some snow around and try to block it.
Matt: Percy, I need you to make a stealth check. Just in general.
Sam: Who, me?
Matt: No, just Percy.
Taliesin: That's 16.
Matt: 16. Good to know. Okay. So you place him up there. What else are you guys doing? You have 30 minutes, 25 now.
Liam: I'm going to hide behind the stone that's in the bottom end of the screen I'm looking at. Nope, opposite side. Nope, opposite wall. Sorry. Behind it.
Sam: Oops, Percy died.
Laura: Don't say that again!
Liam: And I think I already said it, but the Deathwalker's Ward is set to cold.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Does anyone want to be invisible for an hour?
Travis: Are we not going to be in the house?
Sam: Some of us will be. Do you want to wait in the house, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, I'll be in the house.
Sam: And Pike, too?
Ashley: Yeah, I'm going to stay in the house for a little bit.
Sam: Okay, I'm going to cast it and probably go into the house.
Matt: So Pike is staying up in the house?
Taliesin: I would not object to invisibility.
Laura: Yeah, can you make us invisible?
Sam: I can make a couple of you invisible. Keyleth, do you want to make anybody invisible?
Marisha: I can't do that. You keep forgetting that's you who can do that.
Sam: You can't do that?
Marisha: No.
Sam: You know what? I can't do it, anyway. I think Gate is a concentration spell. Even if I'm reading it off a scroll?
Marisha: No, it takes an action to cast.
Sam: It is a concentration spell.
Matt: It is, and as part of the casting of it, it would drop concentration.
Sam: Okay. Then I can't make anyone invisible.
Laura: Can I fly up and see if I can see Percy before I head over to my side?
Matt: You glide up into the air. Make a stealth check.
Laura: I don't want to go too high! 17.
Matt: Okay. You coast up. Make a perception check.
Laura: 32.
Matt: Against the white snow and the ice, the parapet structure itself is slightly off-color to the rest of the ice, and you do see the gleaming of Percy's cloak through the cover you've placed.
Laura: Shit. I dive back down and try to cover him a little bit more before I head over to my side.
Matt: Okay, that'll be the rest of this 30-minute preparation for you to do that. All right, who else is doing what now?
Marisha: I think I just peed a little.
Matt: Keyleth is peeing a little.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on myself as soon as I get to the other side so I can stay stealthed on my side.
Matt: Where are you staying, then?
Laura: On the other ledge. Yeah. I'm trying to hide myself.
Matt: Okay, roll a stealth check. And Trinket is staying in your necklace?
Laura: Yes! 32.
Matt: 32, good to know. All right. Pike, what are you doing? You're staying inside the mansion right now?
Ashley: I'm staying inside the mansion for right now.
Matt: Okay. Any other spells or casting preparation? Consider what spells you have that are not concentration that help defend. This is the time to do it.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and wait until the 15-minute mark-- no, I'm going to wait until the ten-minute mark and then Enhance Ability on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, got you.
Travis: If you pour poison on a blade, do you get poison damage if you hit them with it?
Matt: If there is a blade you can apply poison to, then yes, you would probably do a little bit of poison damage.
Laura: You know what, I want to pop Trinket out. I want him to be in the mansion with Pike and Grog. Go!
Matt: Grog, you're in the mansion, as well? All righty. Kima is like (anticipation noise).
Laura: Hide, Kima! Oh, she doesn't have an earring.
Matt: Nope. She joins you guys in the mansion for now. And Vax, you're hiding over behind that rock? Roll stealth, if you could.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Okay. You grasp onto the rock, and much like the elven cloaks in Lord of the Rings, you blend in with the stonework.
Liam: I'm going to go meditate on disguised dwarves. Goodbye.
Matt: Grog, any preparation you're doing for this? All righty. As time begins to tick down, 15 minutes left, ten minutes left--
Marisha: I cast Enhance Ability on Scanlan.
Matt: Okay, you're enhancing his?
Marisha: Charisma.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: And then I am going to move. We don't have anyone over here yet, really, correct?
Matt: No. You have Percy up here but no one down there.
Marisha: All right, I'm going to-- fuck.
Matt: Going to?
Marisha: Hide behind the tree and stealth as much as I can.
Matt: Okay, roll a stealth check.
Laura: Keyleth, shouldn't you hide in the mansion?
Sam: Can you become an animal?
Laura: Shouldn't you hide right now? Just be out of the way until Vorugal--
Marisha: I can be an animal if you feel like you want eyes out here, as well, but I won't be able to go elemental.
Taliesin: Then no.
Sam: Ever?
Marisha: Until I rest.
Laura: We've got eyes on. We're above. Just go hide.
Marisha: All right, I go in the mansion.
Matt: Okay, Keyleth makes her way back into the mansion. All right. Five minutes. Four minutes. Three minutes. Two minutes.
Sam: I will inspire myself.
Matt: Okay, that's part of your ability.
Sam: Yes, I will say to myself  all right, Scanlan. I know that your palms are sweaty. Your knees are weak, arms heavy. There's cologne on your tunic, Grog's spaghetti. But just remember. You're good enough. You're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.
Travis: Did you merge 8 Mile with--
Liam: With Stuart Smalley.
Matt: All right, so. As you step forward, where do you want to open the Gate scroll?
Sam: I'm still going to hang out by the rocks, and I can go at least 60 feet in front of me, but I'll do 50 feet.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: In the center, basically.
Matt: About there?
Sam: Yeah, sure.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Remember to be super direct with his name.
Sam: And his name is Yenk?
Marisha: Here, let me give you the script.
Matt: As you pull the scroll out, fumbling in your fingers slightly, you're slightly sweaty and nervous.
Sam: I'm not going to read it until I hear wings flapping.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: It takes six seconds to do, right?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh boy. That's an eight.
Marisha: You have advantage on charisma checks.
Matt: This is not charisma. This is his perception.
Laura: Do we see him in the sky at all?
Matt: You make a perception check. Don't hear any wings. You're listening; the wind's (whistles), the sound of the rain hitting the ground.
Laura: 19.
Matt: You begin to hear the flapping of wings in the distance and you glance over.
Laura: Scanlan! What are you doing? Cast it!
Sam: Okay, I'm casting.
Matt: Okay, as you pull the scroll out and begin reading it, the sigils and arcane glyphs are ancient and convoluted, and you're trying to trace them with your eyes and you begin speaking, letting the ancient knowledge that you've gained through your existence of wandering Exandria begin to pour out on its own. You feel the magic take hold and your grip tightens as the script begins to light up with a slight bluish-purple tint. As it begins to light up around, I need you to check to see if you succeed in reading to scroll.
Sam: Okay. So I roll with advantage?
Matt: You roll with advantage. Highest of two.
Sam: (gasps) Not great. Okay. And what am I adding?
Matt: Your d12 to it. So roll a d12. And plus two.
Sam: Plus two?
Matt: Plus two because Jack of All Trades.
Sam: Plus my charisma?
Matt: Plus your charisma bonus, which is six.
Sam: 20.
Matt: Okay, the DC was 19. (yelling)
Marisha: Every little bit helps.
Taliesin: Oh, we made the gumbo.
Matt: As some of the glyphs begin to shake and part of the scroll begins to burn at the edges, you maintain concentration, staring at it. The rain's hammering down on the scroll; it's growing slick and pouring off into the center of your sleeve. You're soaked to the bone now and shivering as you're reading out these various language bits that are flowing through. You're now an instrument for the spell that is beyond your capability, and as suddenly the spell finishes, your fingers tighten and the scroll bursts into flame and turns to dust around you. And for a split second, you think you may have failed. (spell noises) This giant bluish doorway erupts across the way.
Sam: Facing away from me.
Matt: Facing away from you. You see, all of you, that the somewhat dark and shadowed ravine is now suddenly aglow with bright vibrant bluish light. The blue light turns to crimson, to a deep burning red, and you hear this horrible, deep sucking sound. And you watch as Yenk the goristro is thrown from it, landing in the center of the ravine, fist to the ground--
Laura: We're going to die!
Ashley: We're going to die!
Matt: Are you leaving the gate open?
Sam: No, I close it instantly.
Matt: Okay, the gate slams shut behind, the reddish light then now being consumed with a final blip of blue before it disappears.
Sam: I'm going to tiptoe backwards into the mansion.
Matt: Well, the goristro swoops the head over in your direction. I need you to make a stealth check.
Sam: That's a seven.
Liam: Oh, Sam! (groans)
Travis: (whispers) Roll a little better.
Matt: You watch as the hulking behemoth, its extremely muscular body covered in fur and bony protrusions like spikes that jut out of its form, horrible hooked teeth and giant curled horns that push forward with brass jewelry emblazoned across the bone. Whips around, its red eyes beaming straight on you. In a deep, guttural voice, it (foreign words) and begins to just lumber in your direction.
Marisha: Oh god!
Matt: For right now, I need you, just for right now, Scanlan, roll initiative.
Laura: Oh my god.
Sam: 21! (cheering)
Matt: All right, you're going before it does. What are you doing?
Liam: Bamf to the door and go in!
Travis: Focus your chi.
Sam: I sing at it.
Laura: Oh my god.
Taliesin: No, he's got a movement and an action.
Sam: I sing at it. I will sing  (singing) Yenk, you will be our friend, travel through the portal and back again. Your heart is true, you're a fiend and a confidant. Boom boom boom. (speaking) All right, so I will Dominate Monster, with the hand cone.
Matt: Right. All right. Puts you at a full DC of what?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. That is a 13. Those who are watching, Yenk comes barreling, and then comes to a stop and stands there, looking down at this tiny gnome about 40 feet away and nods.
Sam: I say, you will stay here, and you will kill a white dragon.
Matt: You see steam shoot out from the nose as now you notice the sound of the wings. (whooshing)
Sam: And I will tiptoe back into the mansion.
Marisha: That was the coolest thing you've ever done!
Matt: At which point--
Taliesin: No! (yelling)
Sam: It's huge!
Laura: Oh no, he's so big!
Travis: Holy shit.
Liam: Make all the action figure sounds, Matt!
Ashley: That's a biggie.
Matt: At this point in time, Vorugal lands. (snorting) And unleashes a torrent of frozen ice in this direction.
Marisha: I've been waiting for this all week!
Laura: I hope we can take it and it actually does damage.
Matt: That is going to be--
Marisha: Just dies instantly. Oh fuck. Apparently white dragons are its weakness.
Laura: I know!
Sam: We're in a lobby, eating chicken.
Travis: A little elevator music playing.
Matt: As the blast hits, you can see coats of ice across the floor. So you guys are aware, the ice and sleet and everything here is making the entire terrain rough terrain. So everyone is at half speed on foot in this entire battlefield. You can see the actual air around Vorugal itself is crystallizing into thick mist that surrounds his form sightly. Yenk is blasted with all this frozen frost-breath, and you can see the icicles crystallizing against his form. (roars) Goes running forward, and slams, goring with its horns into Vorugal's chest.
Laura: This feels like more like playtime than anything. All the action figures: bam bam bam!
Matt: Watch me play with my toys, guys! All right, you watch as the horns slam into Vorugal's chest, not really expecting the ferocity and the sheer force of this entity it's unfamiliar with. The horns spark with flames, strangely. It also tears this giant gash in two points across Vorugal's chest. You can see white scales fly from the impact. And also, okay. It is not pushed. Vorugal stands its ground as Yenk pulls back. You see dark purple blood from the edge of the horns of the goristro. End of his turn. All right, does not save against the Dominate Monster.
Sam: Yeah, that means he's still dominated. Okay.
Taliesin: He has not realized this is possibly a poor idea.
Travis: Yenk's going to go, "Come on, chum. Let's be friends."
Matt: It did take damage from the ice breath, so it would have been trying to make its save. Did not make it. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to use two of its legendary actions to do a wing attack. With a three, Yenk is knocked prone, and he suffers 15 points of bludgeoning damage. At which point, Vorugal's moving. Takes up into the air, right above. Now coming to Vorugal's turn. Vorugal gets cold breath back. And while Yenk is on the ground, looking upward and trying to get back up from the slick snow, releases another blast of cold breath down onto Yenk once more. Constitution save, plus 14. Does make its save again. It's a hardy individual; constitution saves are high. It causes this cluster of ice to gather around his form, and he breaks free. Vorugal is then also going to use its flight to move over this way and spin around.
Liam: Natural 20 on my stealth.
Matt: Yenk is going to use its turn to stand up. It looks around. It does make its save, breaking Dominate Monster, so that is gone.
Sam: Okay. Would I feel that? No, I'm on another plane of existence.
Matt: You're on another plane of existence. You guys are all in this quiet space, fingers crossed, hoping right now. Yenk looks frustrated at this point in time. Not a whole lot I can do right now at the moment, so it's going to run beneath and attempt to leap to grab it. Unfortunately, it does not make the full height. Leaps up in the air with all its strength; its thick muscular, hoofed hind legs crouch down and leaps in the air, its giant claws reaching forth, but Vorugal keeps just out of reach and kicks out with its claws and tail, knocking it back onto the ground. It lands, no effect. Vorugal's turn now. Actually, at the end of Yenk's turn-- no, it's not close enough. Come back to Vorugal's turn. Vorugal does not get the ice breath back. It's going to swoop down, eager to finish this hunt, and is going to unleash a series of attacks. Yeah, this is an interesting dynamic right now, because it looks like Yenk is resisting a lot of the cold impact from this. Vorugal's going to do a full range of attacks. Hits with the bite, hits with the claw, hits with the tail. Lands and bites into him. You see ice shards go shooting off from the impact with the teeth. Both claws tear into the chest, but you can see the flesh itself is hardy and resistant to the dragon's attacks. It's damaging it, but Yenk is definitely made of sturdier stuff.
Laura: While this is going on  Percival.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: If Yenk dies really fast, what do we do?
Taliesin: I'm going to signal them to come out.
Laura: Oh fuck.
Matt: Okay, it comes to Yenk's turn now. As you guys are having this conversation, he is going to make two of its fist attacks and one with its hoof.
Sam: Yes, Yenk! Yes!
Matt: A hit. A miss. And a hit.
Taliesin: He's expending power, as well.
Marisha: Yeah, he's burned two of his legendary actions already. Yeah, we're watching the dragon burn through his legendary actions.
Taliesin: That's the other thing.
Laura: Oh, that's great!
Matt: Legendary actions it gets every turn.
Laura: He hasn't burned through any resistances, though.
Matt: You watch as after the clawing goes through Yenk's chest, Yenk reaches up and grabs the edge of Vorugal's scaly back of its head and uppercuts right into the jaw, and then brings up one of its hooves and straight-up chest kicks with the sharpened hoof into the center of Vorugal's chest. It leaves Vorugal stumbling back for a second. At the end of that turn, it's going to use two of its legendary actions to once again beat its wings. Yenk, not being a very dexterous individual, fails and gets knocked prone once again, sending Vorugal once again up to there. Back to Vorugal's turn, he does not get the ice breath, but it looks like Vorugal actually is moving further and further away and is biding his time.
Sam: I'm going to cast Invisibility on myself and poke my head out the door. Yeah, that'll work.
Matt: Yeah, you look out. Make a perception check. The sleet is coming down pretty hard, so you're having to glean what you can.
Sam: Fucking eight.
Matt: You can see some movement of dragon stuff in the air, and you hear various pitches of growling, horrible, angry yelling in the center of the battlefield.
Marisha: So we know they're here.
Matt: You know they're there.
Sam: Battle is still going on. I'll check again in 12 seconds.
Matt: Yenk's turn, very frustrated, can't seem to figure out what to do, is going to attempt to leap once more. Nope. He runs, leaps, tries to grab at the foot. Vorugal steps out of the way. Yenk finishes landing on the opposite side; no effect. Turns around. All right. Vorugal. Gets the cold breath back. He is going to fly backwards, and as it does, sprays an unholy mess of frozen breath energy down towards Yenk, who does not make the save, but still takes resistant damage, thanks to cold resistance. You watch with each impact Yenk's open wounds are getting frost shards jammed into them. Right now, it looks like Yenk doesn't have much of a recourse until Vorugal is on the ground, and Vorugal seems to have noticed this and is starting to keep a distance, and is waiting.
Marisha: I can ground him.
Sam: And expose yourself?
Marisha: I'm just throwing it out there. I can ground him.
Matt: Back to Yenk's turn. At the end of Vorugal's turn, Vorugal is going to take up about ten more feet... to get completely out of his leaping range there.
Liam: How high is he?
Matt: Right now? 60 feet up. Yenk leaps and can't quite get that height and angrily begins to reach over and climb up the side of the mountain there.
Liam: Can I attack him right now?
Matt: What's up?
Liam: Can I attack him right now?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: Vorugal. 60 feet. I'm sharpshooter; he's 60 feet away from me.
Matt: 60 feet is your range. He's a little higher than 60 feet from the angle.
Sam: Are you on the ground?
Laura: He's on the ground.
Liam: Pop out the wings.
Matt: Or the wings, you could do that.
Liam: Fly within 40 feet of him. Throw Whisper at his ass. That's what I'm doing. Assassin.
Sam: Are you going to go up his ass into his stomach?
Laura: In the dragon again.
Sam: In the dragon!
Matt: All right. As you step over, the wings unleash and you fly up right underneath Vorugal right there.
Liam: Do I need to roll for stealth, though?
Matt: No, you're still stealthed. You were holding that, yeah. You don't seem to be noticed. Right now, Vorugal's attention is faced over as it's floating, staring at Yenk, who's now starting to climb up the side of the mountain.
Liam: So finally, this is advantage and an automatic critical hit? Assassin trait.
Matt: Well, let's see. I'd say, given the circumstances, it is unaware that you are part of the battlefield, even though there is a current threat in its circumstance, so in this situation-- let me double-check real fast.
Sam: It's not even a Dungeons and Dragons book.
Taliesin: It's a cookbook!
Sam: They're all people!
Sam: It's a cookbook!
Taliesin: It's a cookbook!
Matt: I would say, given the fact that it's completely unaware there was any other combatants in the vicinity aside from Yenk, I will allow this to be a surprise attack from you, though he is not considered surprised to anybody else. There isn't a surprise round.
Liam: All right. I rolled a 28.
Matt: Oh, that hits.
Liam: This is Whisper. I'm using Whisper. I'm going to cast Divine Smite on the attack, as well.
Matt: All right. Roll damage on that.
Ashley: Kill him. One turn.
Liam: Here we go. Two.
Laura: (laughing) Four!
Liam: Hold on. No, so all the dice first. Two plus the psychic damage, which is 1d8. Nine. Plus the Divine Smite, which is 15. Yeah, here comes the sneak attack damage. (counting) 38, plus my modifier which is 46. No, we double the dice first, so 38 times two. 76. Plus eight is 84.
Matt: 84 points of damage against Vorugal. Are you going with the blade, or you letting it sit?
Liam: Oh, I went with the blade.
Laura: So you're on Vorugal right now?
Matt: So as you throw the blade up, it strikes into one of the wounds that Yenk had already clawed under its chest, and the blade sinks up to the hilt and further in, and as you appear, you're actually wrist-deep in the wound right now.
Travis: Back in the dragon again!
Matt: You are right up with Vorugal right now.
Liam: I'm hasted. That's action number one. Action number two is to throw Whisper down toward the trees closest to you, DM, and bamf there, and use my bonus action to hide. I'll hit the ground, right?
Matt: The blade loses its luster and stumbles into the snow. (clinking) Hits the ground. It's out of range. It doesn't hit anything solid; you don't go with the blade.
Liam: I'm going to push off him, then.
Laura: You have wings.
Liam: Yeah, I know that. What did I use? I used 40 feet of movement?
Matt: Correct.
Liam: Okay. I don't know how much I have left. If I'm hasted, I would have 120 total, but that's halved, so 20 feet, because you said rough terrain. But I'm in the air?
Matt: You're in the air, but there's a lot of sleet and rain hitting.
Liam: So ten feet. That's all right. I'm going to keep moving away. I'm going to use all my movement to get away from him and go away from his butt. I should have a bonus action that I can use. The rest of my movement, plus dash.
Matt: All right, before you get there, he's now (roars). The angry scream. Vorugal's head swoops around underneath and directly into your eyes as you dart away with the blade. He spins in place and bites at you as you're trying to pull away.
Liam: I have advantage on dexterity saving throws.
Matt: Okay. This is a bite attack, so it doesn't matter. So that is a 26?
Liam: That hits.
Matt: All right. So you take 22 points of piercing damage.
Liam: Okay. Can I Uncanny Dodge this? Is this melee?
Matt: Yeah, it's a melee attack, so you can do that. Plus 14 points of cold damage.
Liam: Which is halved because of my armor, so 26 down to 13 and seven. 20 total.
Matt: Yeah, 20 total, reduced by half because of Uncanny Dodge, you said?
Liam: Okay, so I'm down to 95.
Matt: Okay. So 95. You pull away to about there, the rest of your movement?
Liam: I want to use bonus action to dash. I don't know if that gets me 60 feet away flying.
Matt: Flying, so it would be 30.
Liam: It's 120 hasted, so 60 feet halved.
Matt: Okay, so yeah, you can get all the way to the ground if you want to.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: You get down to the ground about there if you want. Okay. Now I need you to go ahead and roll initiative and put you on the initiative order.
Liam: Yes, sir.
Matt: You have now engaged.
Liam: Okay, so it's an 11.
Matt: An 11.
Taliesin: Have you said anything in the earpiece yet?
Liam: Well, you guys saw it. People inside can't hear me.
Matt: All right, so comes back to the top of the round now. Yenk is currently climbing up the side. Gets about halfway up the side. Is not entirely up, but is clawing up, and you feel the impact from where you're standing, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm holding.
Matt: Going to use the rest of his action to climb up. Gets all the way to the top of the ravine, which is about at the same height that Vorugal is. Based on your help, I need you to roll another stealth check because you helped him for the last half hour. You have advantage because she was helping you.
Taliesin: Oh! 13. 13, because I'm at a negative one.
Laura: 13? That's worse than it was before!
Matt: Yenk gets to the top and turns around and sees Vorugal off to the side, glances down and goes (foreign words). And is going to make a giant bowling underhand fist punch right towards you, Percy.
Taliesin: I was holding ready. Can I try and beat his initiative and get a shot off first?
Matt: As a reaction right now, you can go ahead and take a shot.
Marisha: It's time to go.
Sam: Has it been two rounds?
Taliesin: Jenga!
Matt: It's been more than two rounds since this started.
Sam: How about since I looked last?
Matt: It's been almost a round.
Laura: Can I see all this happening?
Matt: You do watch this happening.
Laura: I'm going to take an arrow and shoot it. I can see the door, but it's not going to register on a magical door, is it?
Matt: No.
Laura: Fuck.
Marisha: We're about to pop out.
Liam: Hey, B-T-dubs, I've just learned that Whisper can only bamf me once per round, right?
Matt: It needs to solidly hit something.
Liam: To stick within 60 feet. Got it.
Matt: You can't throw it as hard as you can and it'll teleport you wherever it lands. It has to impact.
Taliesin: I'm going to press a torso push with this, by the way.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, I'm going to press a torso push. Better! 33. I don't even know why I bother. He's automatically pushed ten feet away from me.
Matt: He does still get the one hit on you, which is 27.
Taliesin: Oh, that hits.
Matt: You take 23 points of bludgeoning damage from the fist, and then the fist seems to sparkle with electrical energy as it goes to impact you.
Taliesin: That's magic.
Matt: It is not a magic spell, no. You take six points of lightning damage.
Marisha: Yenk is on top?
Matt: Yenk is at the top of the ravine.
Marisha: Isn't Percy halfway down?
Matt: Yenk got up to where he would see him and then saw him as he was passing by. Stopped to slam him.
Taliesin: So 23 plus six. That's fine. The lightning damage, the cloak doesn't absorb that?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay. Then I'm going to do my damage on him, which is new to me. That's terrible. That's 11 points of damage, plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: 13 points of damage. Gets pushed back. Because he's still holding onto the edge, he has to see if he can-- No, it does not. Yenk loses grip from the blast of the gun after punching you, stumbles back. Claw hits the edge and falls down prone to the ground at the base of the ravine. 40 feet.
Taliesin: 50 feet.
Matt: 50 feet. Taking an additional 16 points of bludgeoning damage, which is halved.
Taliesin: Do I join the initiative order?
Matt: You do. Go ahead and roll initiative.
Taliesin: 21.
Matt: 21. All right. That ends Yenk's turn. Vorugal does not get the ice breath back. However, does see both of you in the vicinity.
Laura: Me?
Matt: Does not see you, no, but it sees Vax and Percy.
Taliesin: It sees me? All right.
Matt: The blast of the gun and the impact and the whole encounter with Yenk exposed you. It's going to use its action to use Frightful Presence, so I need both Percy and Vax-- and Vex, actually, because you're still within the range-- to make a wisdom saving throw. You have advantage. You guys are immune to frightening, so it doesn't actually affect you regardless, so don't worry about it.
Liam: Don't roll?
Matt: Don't have to roll; you're immune to fear. Yenk makes his saving throw, so Yenk is not afraid, either.
Marisha: Thanks, Pike! Should we pop out? Should we do this?
Laura: No, not yet!
Sam: After 12 seconds, I will look. I will stick my head out and look again.
Matt: Vorugal is now watching the battlefield and seeing the people that have been revealed. Vorugal's going to go up a little higher.
Sam: He's a total not-a-good-hunter. I thought he enjoyed the hunt!
Matt: He doesn't enjoy being ambushed or in a fight that he can't win.
Sam: I've poked my head out to look.
Matt: Okay. You look out and you see Vorugal way high in the air. You see Yenk on the ground, and you see a couple of your companions less stealthed than they were before.
Marisha: What's it looking like, Scanlan?
Sam: I pop my head back in and I tell them  shit's going down. Should we go out or let this play out a bit? Yenk is not dead.
Taliesin: Jenga!
Laura: They can't hear you, Percy. I can hear you, but they can't.
Sam: Yenk is not dead, so we will be fighting Yenk, as well.
Ashley: We can't leave them out there alone.
Sam: I guess we go.
Ashley: Right? Are we going to leave them out there to die?
Marisha: I can try and ground him. It's a strength saving throw, though; it's going to be tough.
Laura: Try and ground Vorugal? Try it.
Marisha: I say, excuse me, Scanlan.
Matt: Those who are entering the fray, roll initiative.
Sam: I'm going to leave the mansion and start running.
Marisha: Son of a fuck!
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14. What did you get, Keyleth?
Marisha: Four.
Sam: That's top of the round!
Matt: Anyone else? Grog?
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15. All righty.
Liam: You get advantage, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Vex, do you want to roll?
Laura: I guess as soon as I see everybody run out, I would start attacking.
Matt: Pike, you as well?
Ashley: Five.
Sam: Yeah, this is great.
Travis: Wow. Fuck me.
Liam: Oh jeepers, we're going to die.
Sam: Don't worry, we've got our secret weapon. Our secret weapon, by the way, now wants to kill all of us.
Marisha: Did he lose his save against it?
Sam: He wants to kill us.
Taliesin: Except that he also has a dragon to contend with, so as long as we keep it a bigger threat than us, I think he'll keep his concentration where it is.
Marisha: We should still try to stay out of all this.
Matt: Everyone who has rolled initiative will be on the next initiative order. Vax, you're finishing up this round.
Liam: Oh, I am? I would like to throw Whisper to the rock I was initially hiding behind and bamf there.
Matt: Roll an attack roll.
Liam: Yeah. Sure, that's 25. I would like to use my bonus action to hide behind that rock.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Liam: That is a 25. Can I hold my last action?
Matt: You could hold an action to do one thing with a trigger, sure. You can use your hasted action.
Liam: I'm going to stay put. Stay hidden.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top of the round. Percy, you're at the top.
Taliesin: Oh boy. Okay. I'm going to take a wing shot at that dragon to try and drop him. Come on. Natural 20.
Laura: (yelling) Yes!
Ashley: There it is.
Taliesin: Does the 1d6 also double? Is it all dice or just the standard damage?
Matt: No, the dice, as well.
Ashley: No mercy Percy!
Marisha: You're my favorite.
Taliesin: Oh, you say that now. Let's see how this goes. First the damage, which is not bad. 16 points of normal damage and 11 points of psychic damage, and he's prone.
Matt: What's the total on that one?
Taliesin: 16 and 11. That's 27.
Matt: All right. Well, it has to make a strength save.
Taliesin: No, not against the wing shot. Oh, strength saving throw; you're right. Against a DC of 19.
Matt: That is a success. 21.
Taliesin: Again. That'll hit. 31 to hit.
Matt: 31 will hit, yep.
Taliesin: Same thing. 15 points of damage plus one psychic, so 16.
Matt: 16, and what was the DC again?
Taliesin: 19.
Matt: 19? Just fails with an 18, so instead of being knocked prone it drops 60 feet per round.
Taliesin: So it's dropping now?
Matt: We'll say for now, yes, it's dropping.
Sam: Come on, Yenk. Kill that thing. (plastic platform clatters)
Sam: He died!
Taliesin: What should I make it have difficulty with? Not saving, but checks.
Sam: He's not going to have to check anything.
Taliesin: You never know.
Matt: There. All right, Percy. That was your second shot.
Taliesin: One more shot. First, I'm going to Hex the dragon. I'm going to give him disadvantage against strength checks. And I'm going to shoot him with a sharpshooter shot for my last shot. Come on. Yeah! 29.
Matt: 29 hits.
Taliesin: This is good. (excited yell) 18. Oh my god, okay. 28 plus five psychic, so that's 33 points of damage, plus another d6. Plus another five necro.
Matt: Nice, 38. As you're aiming up as Vorugal's getting further and further away, you aim up and fire. One side hits it and wings it ever so slightly, the second shot you aim the other side it actually hits the joint and causes the wing to flap. Vorugal tumbles out of the air for a second and just manages to catch himself and the final shot impacts right in the back of the skull spines and shatters part of the bone and ice off of it, leaving a nice, fresh wound in the back of the head.
Taliesin: Now, I'm going to take cover in my little cove.
Liam: I'd like to think of you driving and cutting someone off on the 101 and going, "Plus five necro."
Taliesin: Plus five necro, motherfucker.
Matt: All right.
Taliesin: He's checking the sheet. Oh no.
Laura: Oh no, what are you looking at?
Taliesin: It means there's a very angry dragon now that's looking at me.
Matt: Okay, so Kima, who's now eager to get out there goes, "Okay. All right. Let's do this." She's going to cast Aura of Vitality on herself as her action. Then she goes running through the center of the portal, leaps out, turns the corner to there and stops and goes, "Oh shit." That's her turn.
Marisha: That's her turn?
Matt: She's just entering the fray and did a preparation spell as part of that. Ending Kima's turn, let's see here. From out of seemingly nowhere in particular, you see a flash of electrical energy arcing from one of the nearby sections of the crevasse alcove. The bolt of energy arcs out and slams into Vorugal, who does not make the save, not seeing it there.
Taliesin: All right. We've got a game.
Sam: Five points of damage!
Marisha: What are you good for?
Matt: That'll be 41 points of lightning damage.
Sam: Okay!
Marisha: Remember, she learned from the druids a bunch of fucking nature shit.
Matt: One of the arcs tries to reach for Yenk and manages to disperse before it can get to it. It's not quite within range, but that finishes wherever that lightning source was. Yenk angrily is going to stand up and turn. It is going to attempt to run and grab up at Vorugal again.
Marisha: Come on, Yenk!
Sam: Come on, Yenk!
Matt: Leaps and misses, (impact) landing right next to the rock. That's a natural 20 on a perception check as it lands (impact) and looks over right into your face.
Liam: Hi.
Matt: Yenk is now aware of you.
Taliesin: He's just noticing everybody.
Matt: At the end of Yenk's turn-- that's not going to help him right now. That's going to end that. Vorugal's turn. Breath does return this time. Vorugal, from up here, is going to send ice breath across the entire ground, sweeping up across both Yenk and Vax. I need you to make a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Could I use Evasion for this?
Matt: No, it's constitution.
Liam: All right. I'm going to use Luck. First Luck of the day. All right, 13.
Matt: 13? No. You suffer 72 points of cold damage, halved because of your resistance.
Ashley: How much, again?
Matt: 72, but halved because of your cold resistance. 36 points of cold damage to you.
Travis: Um. What?
Matt: Vorugal's then going to take higher up into the air.
Taliesin: Can he do that already, even recovering from the prone?
Matt: Yeah. The idea with prone is that unless there's something that maintains or it can't improve its movement past its next turn, it continues to fall. That's going to finish Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm up?
Matt: Yep. You're still inside the mansion.
Sam: Do not draw attention to yourself, friend.
Travis: Fuck that. We're all going down. I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash them together, and I use the Enlarge, and I will burst out of the mansion in a rage.
Liam: Big Grog!
Matt: So that's 30 feet of movement. You have 20 more feet, if you want.
Travis: No, remember it's halved.
Matt: All right. Then there, that's 25. That's your movement. The gauntlets took your bonus action. You can still use your action to dash, if you want to move further. Or do you want to stay there and hold your action?
Liam: Wait. I'm sorry. Yenk knew where I was. Did the dragon know where I was, too?
Matt: It's funny. It hit Yenk and the whole thing, but the dragon has an aerial view, and you have a single rock that you went behind to hide, and it saw you move behind the rock. You have to break eye contact to stealth.
Travis: I'll use that dash to keep moving towards the ice wall, towards you. Maybe two or three squares. That will be my turn.
Matt: You can get there. Hulking, axe gripped, giant Grog is leaping through the snow. (impacts) You're two-thirds the size of Yenk, right now, which is crazy. All right, that ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? I'm still invisible. I'm going to leave the mansion.
Matt: You're not still invisible, because you cast Dominate Monster.
Sam: No, I cast Invisibility after I cast Dominate Monster. I'm going to leave the mansion and clockwise around the game board.
Matt: That's as far as you can get, there, with your reduced movement.
Sam: If I inspire, that kills my invisibility?
Matt: Technically, no. It's not an attack or an action, so I would say it wouldn't. It may give away your location.
Sam: Then I will use my bonus action to keep moving. To dash?
Matt: To dash is your action. You can do that, yeah. Your bonus action, that's only a rogue ability.
Sam: I will dash and keep moving away and that way.
Matt: This way? Okay. That's your action.
Sam: That's it?
Matt: Yeah. It's big, heavy snow and slick ice. You're having to be careful.
Sam: Okay. I don't want to draw attention to myself, so that'll be that.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: I'm only within range of Kima. I'm not going to give away my position to inspire her.
Matt: All right, finishing your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Holy shit. Yeah, I'm going to take to the air. Holy shit. I'm going to fly within 60 feet of Vorugal. 55 feet away.
Matt: That will put you about there. Okay. Yenk has a reach of ten because his arms are long, and you're within his combat range, so as soon as you fly up, he swings out with his fist to attempt to impact you.
Liam: All right, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: As you're with your wings, dagger out, this fist comes swinging like a battering ram from the side. That is 22 to hit. Misses. (whoosh) You just barely dodge out of the way. You feel the force of it, the wind batter a bunch of errant falling sleet and snow across your face, but you rush past, the hasted bonus saving you on that one.
Liam: Okay, so how far did I just go?
Matt: That would have been 55 feet.
Liam: 55 feet. I can go 120 in one action, so that's my movement.
Matt: Halved, yeah.
Liam: Halved, but 120, so that's my movement, total. I'm going to throw Whisper in his face. I'm not going to bamf there; I'm just going to throw the dagger.
Matt: Into Vorugal?
Liam: Vorugal's face. That's halfsies, so I'm going to roll it again. That's way better. That is a 32.
Matt: That hits. How many Luck have you used, by the way?
Liam: One. That is 12 plus the psychic damage.
Matt: I thought you used Luck once before, today.
Liam: I don't think so. Not since waking up.
Matt: It would have been yesterday. You're right.
Liam: 12, plus two is 14, and I'm going to cast Divine Smite-- no, I'm not. No, just 14 of damage, so that's movement, action. My next action I'm going to use to fly under him, halfway between Percival and the gang, and land on the wall.
Matt: Land on the wall this way?
Liam: Yeah. Now, that wall is higher up than it looks, so I'm really flying straight, right?
Matt: Correct. We'll say you're about there, technically.
Liam: Yes, and then for a bonus action, my last spell slot, I'm going to cast Shield of Faith on my fucking self for a plus two to AC.
Matt: There you go. Ending Vax's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Yikes. Well. Are we outside the mansion?
Matt: No, you're inside the mansion right now. You just watched Grog, Kima, and Scanlan all dart out of it. Well, you didn't see Scanlan leave. Scanlan vanished.
Ashley: Scanlan vanished.
Matt: It's you, Trinket, and Keyleth.
Laura: Did I ever get on the initiative order?
Matt: What did you roll? Ten, right? You'd technically be after Vax. We'll do your turn after this, but you're after Vax.
Ashley: I'm going to pop out. Maybe I can stay in there and do this, in the door, and try to cast Divine Intervention.
Matt: Divine Intervention? All right, so you step out and you see this chaos happen: the dragon in the air, the fiend on the side, swinging and barely missing a flying Vax, who swoops past in the middle of this sleet storm. You close your eyes and concentrate, holding your holy symbol, praying that Sarenrae has the ability to reach beyond the Divine Gate and lend you her strength temporarily. I need you to roll a d10.
Marisha: Man, how awesome would this be?
Laura: It would be insane.
Matt: What did you roll?
Ashley: A ten?
Matt: A zero?
Laura: Yeah, a zero.
Marisha: (excited gasping) Shut the fuck up! She has to roll under her level, which she did.
Matt: So this succeeded.
Marisha: Shut the fuck up, Ashley!
Matt: So as you clutch your holy symbol, concentrating, hoping that she's there, feeling the division between the gods and their followers since the Divergence occurred. You've reached out to her a number of times. You look up through the darkness of your closed eyes, and you see a light, a beacon open. The clouds part, and suddenly the sound of rain goes away. The sound of all the chaos goes away, and it's just warmth and quiet, and you watch as Sarenrae's hand comes down and touches your forehead, and with your closed eyes, and says, "I'll do what I can." As she drifts away and smiles, you watch as her hand turns into a fist, and she looks up and disappears into the light. As you open your eyes, you now see up in the sky above Vorugal, the clouds that are dark, a sparkle of divine energy begins to swirl. As it grows stronger and stronger, the clouds suddenly part, and a giant column of divine energy (boom) slams down, right on top of Vorugal. Vorugal looks up just in time to try to move out of the way before it slams him back. Does not make his dex save with a roll of five. Vorugal suffers 50 points of divine damage and is slammed onto the ground. (cheering)
Taliesin: Stay down!
Marisha: Yes! Holy fuck! Pike! That was amazing!
Ashley: Oh boy!
Liam: Action figure is down.
Matt: Additional 26 points of bludgeoning damage. As the light column slams Vorugal to the ground, you can see some of the ice and snow underneath melts immediately, and what was once a column, you can see now looks like a giant fist made of spiritual energy that then withdraws slowly off the back of Vorugal and then dissipates before the clouds close up once more.
Ashley: Yes! It worked!
Matt: That's your movement and your action.
Ashley: For a bonus action, I would like to place a spiritual weapon at the back of his neck, since he's on the ground. And I would like it to be a very large flaming sword.
Matt: Okay. You watch as the hand of Sarenrae dissipates, some of the energy that's residual there lingers, and then forms into a flaming sword of pure golden-white energy. It is now hovering over the currently slammed-down, broken-looking body of Vorugal.
Sam: She's the best one of the group! (laughter)
Matt: All righty. That was... What level spell was that, again, Pike? Second level. Got it. All right, so make a melee spell attack against Vorugal. Roll a d20 and add, I believe it's 11. Roll a d20 and add 11 to it as the flaming blade attempts to strike down towards Vorugal.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll 1d8 plus five.
Ashley: Okay, well, six. Sarenrae did the damage.
Matt: Six points of divine damage.
Ashley: Sarenrae does 50 points of damage, and I do six.
Matt: Through you, did 50 points. You're still part of it. All right, that ends Pike's turn. Vex, we're taking your turn because you weren't in the initiative order.
Laura: That's okay. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on Vorugal.
Matt: Because dragons are your chosen enemy, I'm giving you the plus two damage against it.
Laura: Okay, so I'm hidden, technically, so I get sneak attack on him, right?
Matt: Currently, you have not been noticed.
Laura: Okay, so I'm going to hit him, or try to. That is 34.
Matt: Yeah, that'll hit. Divine Intervention, man. Finally worked. Can't use it for a week, by the way, Pike, just so you're aware. Once it succeeds, you can't use it for a week.
Ashley: That's fine. (laughter)
Ashley: I doubt it's going to work again. That, I think, has never worked.
Marisha: You've gotten close. You've gotten really close.
Travis: Three years, never worked.
Laura: 30 points of damage on the first hit, and two of those are lightning.
Matt: Great.
Taliesin: Is it gargantuan? Gargantuan. Trust Travis on this one.
Laura: 22 on the second, two of which are lightning.
Matt: Okay. Nice. All right, that ends your turn. You used your bonus action to Hunter's Mark.
Laura: I did. I'm going to hang out there and duck down, if I can, behind my little outcropping.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Oh god. I'm going to pop out of the mansion. I was expecting to do an Earthbind spell, but that's not necessary. That's okay!
Matt: Pike, do you want to move at all, or do you want to stay behind that rock?
Ashley: I'm going to stay behind.
Marisha: I'm going to fuck this guy up while he's down. I'm going to peek around the corner, going towards you a bit, and seeing everyone there and all this go down, I'm going to Fire Storm the fuck out of this!
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Death from above.
Marisha: Fire rains from above!
Taliesin: Fire rains from above!
Matt: How are you organizing the Fire Storm?
Marisha: I have ten of these? I'm shaking.
Matt: Fire Storm, you create ten ten-foot cubes. You can maneuver it to hit both him and Yenk, if you want to.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I want.
Matt: Make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Get that epic loot drop.
Marisha: I know. I want it.
Matt: That is a failure on Vorugal, with a ten, and a seven on Yenk. They both fail, so roll damage on that. 7d10 fire damage.
Marisha: 7d10.
Laura: Hey, Matt.
Matt: Yes?
Ashley: 1d8 plus your spellcasting modifier?
Matt: Which is five. It's your wisdom.
Ashley: Spell attack bonus.
Matt: Yes, there's a difference.
Ashley: I understand.
Laura: Do it, Keyleth!
Taliesin: Want a bonus?
Laura: It doesn't count on the floor.
Marisha: I'll roll this one. It's eight! Okay, hang on. (counting) 30. I picked it up. 38.
Matt: 38 fire damage to both of them. All righty. The Fire Storm tears through the ravine. You can see the flames burn over Vorugal's body. Vorugal is now trying to get back up. (roars) He's extremely angry. The flames curl over Yenk, who bats away at them. It burns him, but Yenk does seem to resist it fairly well.
Marisha: I'm going to use the last bit of my movement to pop back behind the stone.
Matt: Okay. There you go. All righty, does that end your turn? Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to take aim and hold my full attack until he tries to get up.
Matt: Okay. That brings us to Kima's turn. Kima sees the opportunity. Because of the snow, she can't quite get there yet with her full movement, unfortunately. All righty. Kima is going to use the rest of her action to dash and get right up next to Vorugal and is going to use her bonus action to use Vow of Enmity against it. She goes, "You are going to see Bahamut in pieces!" As she brings the thumb across, the holy symbol glows for a second. You see a mark emblazon and burn itself into the side of Vorugal's body. That's going to end Kima's turn.
Taliesin: That's a sick tattoo, y'all.
Laura: Maybe it's like Hex and Hunter's Mark.
Travis: We don't know what that does.
Matt: What's the range on that, actually? That's going to be a rough call. Okay, you watch as emerging from the treeline here, you see a little dwarf step forward, unaffected by the ice, and reach out a hand as a cluster of necrotic energy sparkles in the center. Leaps forward toward Vorugal. That is a success on the save, so it's half damage, but Keyleth, you recognize at a glance of your eye, this necromantic leap. This is a Blight spell.
Sam: Blight spell?
Laura: Who's doing a Blight spell?
Sam: Larkin.
Matt: Larkin.
Sam: He's secretly Raishan!
Liam: What? Where did that dwarf come from? Did you hire more mercenaries? When are they showing up? Hey, I'll own it. It's fine. It's been a long week.
Matt: Yenk turns around with a grin. (impacts) Coming forward.
Sam: Yes, Yenk.
Matt: Is going to make three attacks, and has advantage on these attacks, because it's prone. A five and a one. Are you serious? Misses the first strike, with advantage. Hits with the second attack. Hits with the third. Okay, so that's going to be 48 points of damage from Yenk. Slams a fist once and glides off the scales. Second one goes and slams into the side of Vorugal's neck, and then picks up the hoof and jams it into the side of the skull, cracking into the side of Vorugal's head. You can see some teeth break and get thrown off and scatter into the ice and snow nearby. At the end of Yenk's turn, Vorugal is going to go ahead and use two actions to wing attack once more, getting up. Let's see. Yenk's going to have to make a strength save. Fails. Kima fails, as well. They are both knocked prone and suffer bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Only if you're right on him? I'm only two squares away, I think.
Matt: You are also within 15 feet, Grog, technically, so I need you to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: 17?
Matt: 17 does not cut it. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone.
Liam: All the trees are down.
Matt: It's rough. And Vorugal gets half its speed.
Taliesin: Oh no. He's even starting to move? I'm laying into him. Spending a grit point and I'm knocking him in the foot, back prone before he can even stand up.
Matt: Okay. How many grit points do you have, by the way, now?
Taliesin: This is my third or fourth because I did crit, so I got one back.
Matt: You did. This is correct.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: 22 hits.
Taliesin: That's a d10 and a d6, and another d6. 12 points of damage, plus one necrotic and two psychic, so 15 points of damage, and he has a save against 19.
Matt: That's a natural 20. Has disadvantage because of your--
Taliesin: No, I was about to say, it's a save, not a check.
Matt: Oh, right. Strength checks. So natural 20. Unaffected.
Taliesin: Unaffected? Again!
Matt: This is your last grit point.
Marisha: Can't say we're not honest.
Taliesin: Blowing it. It's worth it. Gun jams.
Matt: Gun jams.
Taliesin: You know what happens.
Matt: So as you go to fire Animus, it charges up for a second and blasts back, and you watch as a bolt of necrotic energy shoots up Percy's arm and into his head and bursts at his temples. You take 2d6 points of psychic damage.
Ashley: Does the spiritual weapon get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: No, it doesn't get attacks of opportunity. It's not a creature.
Taliesin: Ow. That's the end of my turn. I'm going to dive down and hide and hold.
Matt: That ends Yenk's turn. It's now Vorugal's turn. Gets the breath back. Turns around here. At the giant cluster of shit here.
Sam: He does not see me!
Matt: Doesn't need to. You're in a very big space there. I need Pike, Scanlan, and Keyleth to all make constitution saving throws.
Marisha: The cloak doesn't have anything to do with this, right?
Sam: Can I use Cutting Words to reduce the attack?
Matt: It's not an attack. It's an effect that happens.
Marisha: With advantage? Natural 20!
Matt: With advantage? Why do you get advantage?
Marisha: I thought you said advantage.
Matt: No.
Marisha: Fucking fuck! Well, then I guess I reroll.
Liam: Rolled two dice.
Matt: Roll one dice.
Marisha: I should have kept the first one. That's an 18, which is good! 23.
Matt: Okay. Scanlan?
Sam: 13. I add nothing to it, right?
Taliesin: Is it constitution saving? Plus two.
Matt: 23. Pike, what did you get?
Ashley: Nine.
Matt: Nine. Kima failed. So that is 72 points of cold damage to Scanlan, Pike, and Kima.
Ashley: Divided between us all, right? (laughter)
Matt: No, sorry. Halved to you.
Marisha: That's 36?
Ashley: Just 72?
Matt: Wait, does one of you have the Cold Snap armor on?
Laura: I do.
Matt: Oh yeah. So yeah, 36 cold damage to you, Keyleth. 72 to both of you and Kima. And Vorugal is then going to get back a bit and fly a little higher.
Taliesin: He moved really far in one turn.
Matt: The wing effect is a legendary action on somebody else's turn, and then on his turn, he has a speed of 80 feet, flying.
Taliesin: Even halved?
Matt: He's not affected by cold. Sorry, white dragon.
Taliesin: We're still going to need you, then, apparently.
Matt: That's going to end Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh, well, he's in the air, which is my preference, all around. Can I get up, please? Now we're somewhere. Can I move directly under him as far as I can go?
Matt: That's half movement, so that's about as far as you can get right now.
Travis: Can I haste or pick my nose to go any further?
Matt: Unfortunately, no.
Liam: Hold for him to drop?
Travis: I will hold until he drops.
Liam: Oh, sad Grog.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Jesus. I will continue my movement clockwise around the board.
Matt: This way, you mean? That's your movement.
Sam: How far is he from me? A long way.
Matt: Quite a ways right now, yeah.
Sam: 150 to 200 feet?
Matt: Not quite that much, no. Maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 feet.
Sam: Has my invisibility dropped when I got blasted?
Matt: Actually, make a concentration check with advantage, because you have War Caster.
Sam: Concentration? Is it plus anything?
Matt: It's a constitution saving throw.
Sam: 14.
Matt: 14. Yeah, no. You had to beat a 36 because of the damage from the ice blast. Yeah, your invisibility drops. You are now fully visible.
Sam: Okay. Is he within 120 feet of me?
Matt: Yeah, he's within 120 feet, probably.
Sam: All right, I'll punch him in the face.
Matt: Bigby's Hand?
Sam: Yeah. I will Bigby's Hand him.
Matt: All right. Bigby's Hand flies up to meet Vorugal.
Liam: Can you yank his shit down?
Sam: He's way too big. I can try to grab a wing.
Marisha: Can you grapple him? Grapple a wing?
Sam: DM, how does this work? I cannot grapple anything above a huge monster. Can I grapple part of a gargantuan monster?
Matt: Unfortunately, he's just too big for Bigby's Hand.
Sam: So I just punch him. Simply a punch. Bigby's Hand!
Matt: Roll a d20 plus your spell attack bonus.
Sam: 17.
Matt: 17. (whoosh) The fist swings past. Vorugal dodges out of the way, batting his wings and getting out of the trajectory of the fist that just streaks by harmlessly.
Sam: Great. I think I'm within range of Lady Kima? I can inspire her, maybe?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: You know what? Fuck her. I'm going to heal myself. (laughter)
Sam: She crossed me one too many times.
Marisha: She crossed you?
Sam: Fuck her.
Laura: Poor Kima. Trying to get mind-wiped so many times by him.
Marisha: He's a dick to her, and now he's angry about it.
Sam: Healing Word. Can I do level two? That's 2d4 plus six now?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: 12 points. Great. Okay. Thanks.
Matt: All righty. That's your turn, Scanlan?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: Oh jeez! Really? Okay. So I'm right there. Am I within 60 feet?
Matt: Maybe.
Liam: I'm going to fly 20 feet forward through the storm toward him.
Matt: Okay. That will put you right about there.
Liam: Yeah. Dagger, dagger, dagger.
Laura: Oh, you have three daggers still?
Liam: They come back, man. First is 26. Second is a 17, but I'm going to use my second Luck, so the second is a 21. And the third is 19.
Matt: All right. The 17 and 19 miss.
Liam: Okay, so the first one was really high. The second two are mediocre.
Matt: The first one hits. The other two streak off.
Liam: Whisper hits.
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Does he get sneak attack because I'm on the flank with my hand?
Liam: No, I didn't think so. That is terrible. That's just ten. And I use my movement to fly directly under him.
Matt: Okay. You're not going with Whisper?
Liam: Say again?
Matt: You're not going with Whisper?
Liam: No.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: No... Yes, I am.
Matt: Are you?
Liam: Could I have hit him in the tail?
Matt: If you want to, sure. Why not? You impact.
Liam: I got the blade on his tail, and I'm there.
Matt: Okay. You're right there with Vorugal.
Marisha: It's becoming a Jenga mini-game.
Liam: That's where I am.
Matt: All righty. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to try to hit him a couple times.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: My moves are really intricate. 25 for the first one, and I'm using Blazing Bowstring on this. Okay. (counting) Oh! Okay. I have 40 points of damage on the first hit, two of which are lightning, seven of which are fire damage.
Matt: 40.
Laura: And I get sneak attack because Vax is on him.
Matt: Yep.
Sam: Is that Fenthras?
Laura: It's Fenthras. And then 25 on the second hit.
Sam: Points of damage?!
Laura: No, that's just to attack. Oh, jeez Louise. (counting) 23 on the second one, with four points of lightning damage and two points of fire damage.
Matt: All right. So that's your turn?
Laura: And I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Okay. Roll a stealth check.
Laura: Pass Without a Trace still on me?
Matt: No, because you used Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Right. So that is 27.
Matt: Okay, good to know. End of your turn, Vorugal is going to use his legendary action to make a tail attack against Vax.
Liam: Is that melee? Can I use Uncanny Dodge?
Matt: You can if it hits you, yeah. So that is a 26?
Liam: Shite! Yeah, Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: Okay. So as you get up there and the arrows smack into the sides, from both Vex's attacks--
Liam: Wait! I want to use my last Luck to make him roll again. Which I can do.
Matt: Okay, you can. That is 27.
Liam: Wow. It's all right. Uncanny Dodge!
Taliesin: No, what are you going to do? Ancient white dragon. Someone's going to get knocked unconscious.
Matt: 23 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail (whack) slams you in the side, almost breaking one of the wings off, and you just manage to catch yourself in the air. So 28, and you can half that. All right. So that ends Vex's turn. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: All right.
Sam: Do that Divine Intervention thing again. That was really good.
Ashley: It's been a week, right? One week is one round, right? Okay. So what I'd like to do... Here's a question. Flame Strike, since it comes from the sky, would it work since he's up in the sky? Comes from above.
Matt: Ten-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder. Centered around a point within range. So it's a 60-foot range. Doesn't say it has to be on the ground, per se.
Ashley: All right, let's give it a try.
Laura: Do it towards the front of Vorugal, so it doesn't hit Vax.
Liam: Hit him in the face.
Laura: Hit him in the face.
Matt: Ten-foot radius. Yeah. You can direct it where it's not going to hit Vax.
Liam: Thanks, Matt.
Matt: (laughs) All right, so what's your spell DC?
Ashley: 18.
Matt: 18. This is dex, right? It's a 21. He succeeds, so that's half damage. Go ahead and roll damage on that. It's 8d6 damage.
Laura: Oh, do you even have to roll the attack on that?
Matt: It explodes, and it's a saving throw to see if he manages to avoid some of the damage, which he did. What did you get?
Sam: It's ten-foot radius? Ten-foot diameter?
Matt: Ten-foot radius.
Sam: It doesn't hit the Hand, does it?
Matt: No. She's directing it in a way where it hits the front of him. It bursts right through his head and the edge of his wings.
Ashley: 19.
Travis: And two more. That's 8d6.
Laura: It's 8d6?
Matt: 8d6, yeah.
Ashley: Oh! (giggles) Do I add anything else?
Matt: Just those.
Ashley: What is it? 29.
Matt: 29. All right. So 14 points of damage with the halved. (explosion) The blast hits; the flames spin around. You see Vorugal starting to look a bit rough now. It's getting angry; wings are beating faster. You can see there's a feral desperation in Vorugal's eyes right now at all the things that are starting to come at him.
Ashley: I'm going to stay put. And for bonus action, I'm going to cast Healing Word on myself.
Matt: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn, Pike, using another legendary action to make another tail attack at Vax, trying to beat you away from behind at this point. That is a 25.
Liam: That hits.
Matt: That hits? Okay.
Liam: And I'm out of Uncanny Dodge, right?
Matt: Well, you can only make one reaction per round, yeah. That'll put you at 14 points of bludgeoning damage. (whack) Right at your side this time. Though you were able to dodge most of the first impact, this one smacks you to your side, and you spiral over for a second, catching yourself, and still keep afloat right there. All right, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. I am going to cast Earthbind on him.
Matt: Earthbind. What's the range on Earthbind?
Marisha: 300 feet.
Matt: Yeah, that will do it. All right, what's the saving throw on it? Saving throw on that is a strength saving throw. All right, that is a failure. It's going to use one of its legendary resistances to make it. (groaning)
Taliesin: Good, you've burned it. Had to burn it.
Marisha: (frustrated noise)
Travis: She's speaking Parseltongue. (laughter)
Marisha: I am going to do a bonus action to cast Healing Word on myself. Heal myself real quick. Same thing, I want to scoot back a little bit, behind that tree, a bit.
Matt: Right behind here?
Marisha: Yeah, because I got whacked with that ice breath, and I don't want that to happen again. All right.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn? At the end of your turn, he's going to use his third and final legendary action to make another tail swipe at Vax. That is a 27.
Liam: You've hit me right now? Yeah, that hits.
Matt: Okay. This third tail strike right now is going to do 17 points of bludgeoning damage. (impacts) You've been battered in the air by the white dragon tail swinging behind. The focus is less on you as it's hitting you, and it's focusing on the whole battlefield down in front of it and the giant demon that is still lying on the ground.
Liam: Thanks, Heroes' Feast.
Matt: That brings us up to Percy.
Taliesin: I am going to heal, as my bonus action. That's not bad. That's 19 points. I'm a little better now. I'm at 108; I'm fine. Now, I'm going to take out Bad News. Fuck Animus for now. Take out Bad News and take two shots at this bastard with sharpshooter.
Laura: What's Yenk doing down there? Sleeping?
Matt: Yenk got knocked prone.
Taliesin: For fuck's sake!
Sam: Gun jam?
Taliesin: Yeah, gun jammed.
Matt: Fire again, this time (click, explosion). You see a burst of smoke come out, and part of the metal slightly bends. And you're like, "Shit!"
Sam: All your guns?
Taliesin: No, I have one more gun. But I don't have time. That burns an action.
Matt: Yeah. You could use your action surge, if you wanted to.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm using my action surge. Might as well.
Marisha: You try to unjam it?
Taliesin: No, I'm taking out my last pistol and I'm shooting. I'm just going to shoot. See if I can take two more shots. Technically not; it's two shots.
Matt: No, if you're pulling your next gun out. You're not trying to repair?
Taliesin: No, I'm not trying to repair.
Matt: You'd still have two more attacks. Yeah, because you have quick draw. You drop Bad News, grab another weapon. You still have two more attacks.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm taking two more shots, then. Sharpshooter shot with Retort. No, it's different. 16.
Matt: Nope. Fires off in the distant cloud.
Laura: It's that new damn gun. Its sight is all shit.
Taliesin: Ah! That one hits, on the other hand, I think. 22?
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's not much, but I'll take it. Nine points of normal damage plus two necrotic, so that's 11 points of damage. No, 21 points of damage. I'm so sorry.
Matt: Right, with the ten. Yeah. There you go. 21. First one misses. (click) You set it up. This time, takes a shot. (impact) It hits Vorugal from underneath a few feet off from where Vax is. You can see the wound beginning to bleed now. The more damage Vorugal gets, the more you can see the trickle of reddish-blue blood darkening against the white skin. Vorugal is looking fairly damaged.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn my action surge and take three more shots. Fuck it. See if I can lose the third gun. It's that night, apparently. No, I will not. That's 18?
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Fuck the sharpshooter shot. I'm just going for it. No sharpshooter. Thank god! That's 20?
Matt: 20 just hits.
Taliesin: Excellent. Good to know. Oh my god, that's bullshit. Ten points, three necrotic, so it's ten points of damage.
Matt: Your final shot?
Taliesin: My final shot. No, it didn't. This one doesn't do that. That's nice, but I miss. That's 16. That misses.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Thankfully, it doesn't burn that gun. No, that gun is better built. I'm rolling really poorly.
Matt: That ends your turn. That comes to Kima's turn. Kima is going to get up.
Travis: Come on, represent us melee-ers!
Laura: The three of you down on the ground.
Matt: I know. This is a rough fight for the melee.
Travis: I'm making a mean face, so far.
Marisha: You're mad-dogging the dragon?
Matt: Did maintain concentration. That's good. Kima's going to use a bonus action to heal you, Grog, for nine points. Nine health, using her Aura of Vitality.
Sam: Why wouldn't she heal me?
Matt: She's not close enough to you, unfortunately.
Sam: And she hates me.
Matt: Yeah, you may have pissed her off. She will move up into range with Yenk, but she can't actually attack. Too much ice, and her legs are not the longest, and she's having a hard time getting in the fray, but now she's locked in the battle.
Sam: Larkin's turn.
Laura: Good old Larkin!
Sam: Good old Larkin! Come on, Larkin. Bring him down!
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Where is Yenk?
Taliesin: Yenk ain't got nothing but us to hit right now. Let's not dwell on that.
Matt: It's Larkin's turn, technically.
Sam: (singing) You see him Larkin. You hating. (laughter)
Matt: You watch as the tiny dwarf form looks around at the chaos here, and with how things are going, "Shite!"
Laura: Don't you fucking ditch! Don't you ditch out!
Matt: His form vanishes as a green dragon appears. (shouting)
Liam: Cards on the table!
Matt: All right, uses the movement to fly up.
Marisha: Is she going to go for him?
Laura: She's going! She's doing it. She's so teeny compared to him!
Matt: She is a diseased dragon. And releases (blows air) cold blast of poison breath at this direction.
Marisha: Heroes' Feast, man.
Matt: As the billowing cloud of toxic fumes fills you, you instinctually freak out for a second before you realize that the magical protection in your lungs is preventing any of it from taking hold inside. That's cocked. It does make its save.
Sam: What kind of save is it?
Matt: It's a constitution.
Sam: Does the Hand need to make a save? Hand has an AC of 20 and my hit points.
Matt: I don't know if the poison's going to affect Bigby's Hand. It'is arcane. It's not going to affect that. That's for more of physically hitting it. However, Vorugal does end up taking 38 points of poison damage.
Sam: And then Vax goes, "Wait a second, Larkin was a dragon?!" (laughter)
Matt: Okay, at this point, that's going to end Raishan's turn. Yenk gets up, looking at the battlefield. He sees this giant, hulking goliath. Well, technically with Seeming, a large dragonborn with an axe. Lurches forward. Kima gets an attack of opportunity against Yenk.
Laura: Would he still look like a little dragonborn?
Matt: No, his physical form still shifts into a larger one. He looks smaller than his actual self, I guess, comparatively. We'll say for the fun element of it, he still looks like a bigger dragonborn, as Grog wants to look bigger on this one. Kima does hit Yenk. She's going to use Divine Smite, 4th-level spell against him as part of that. Ooh! That's going to be nice.
Taliesin: Remember to go into the stomach, if it goes. We've got a relic in its stomach.
Marisha: Don't eviscerate him. It's fine. It's not going anywhere.
Matt: 21 plus 4d8. 5d8 because it is a fiend.
Travis: Yeah! 5d8 because it is a fiend!
Matt: I don't want to rob her of any awesome damage here.
Travis: Yeah, come on. For the very few times Kima gets to get shake the dust off.
Matt: I know. Seriously!
Marisha: It does look like he's copping a feel.
Sam: Cupping?
Ashley: Little pinch.
Matt: She gets additional 1d8. It's 5d8 additional damage.
Sam: Trumping right now?
Marisha: No, this is our fantasy land, man.
Taliesin: No! Nixing it! This is my safe place.
Matt: 48 points of damage in one strike from Kima against Yenk.
Travis: Just from the attack of opportunity?
Matt: Just attack of opportunity, yeah. She poured a level four Divine Smite spell into it and (impacts) as she slams behind. Fiends are a paladin's thing. As Yenk's running away towards you, Grog, she says, "No, you don't!" (impacts) Slams up with her maul and strikes at the side of Yenk, causing him to tumble. He's still keeping his trajectory, though. He slams forward towards you. That's more than 15 feet. He's going for a gore attack against you, Grog, with the horns, like he did with Vorugal at the beginning of the battle.
Liam: He's going to take 15 percent of your hit points.
Matt: (chuckles) Yeah. That is a 22.
Travis: That'll hit.
Sam: Can I Cutting Words that?
Matt: I don't think you're in range.
Sam: Am I 60 feet?
Matt: 60 feet? Let me se. 60. Just out of range. You suffer 55 points of piercing damage from the horns, halved, plus an additional 38 points of piercing damage from the momentum from the gore.
Travis: And you said additional 30?
Matt: Additional 38.
Travis: Additional 38, so that's halved also. 19?
Matt: 19 on top of the half. Plus an additional seven points of cold damage as the horns strike into you, the horns almost solidify into ice spikes as it hits you, the ice breaking off.
Sam: Would have been great against a fucking dragon.
Laura: It did. It did the fire damage against the dragon.
Travis: 48 points of damage.
Matt: Okay. There you go. That ends Yenk's turn. It is now Vorugal's turn. Vorugal's pissed and hurt and angry and is going to move away.
Laura: You get an attack of opportunity!
Liam: Did he move away?
Matt: You do get one, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. No sneak attack because it's just me and Bigby, right?
Matt: Currently, yes. You don't get sneak attack here, no.
Liam: Right, because there's nobody here with me. 27 hits, so that is a three plus eight is 11, plus my psychic damage is 12.
Laura: How do you want to do this?
Liam: That'd be great, cut him in the butt.
Matt: Nice. That's some good luck with the ice breath this battle.
Travis: There are three giant monsters.
Marisha: Jesus, he's back for my shit. He's back for me and you, Pike.
Matt: I need Keyleth, Pike, and Scanlan to all make constitution saving throws.
Sam: Oh boy.
Marisha: Okay. 18.
Matt: 18.
Sam: 15.
Matt: Pike? All right, all three of you guys take 72 points of cold damage.
Laura: Okay. So that's unconscious.
Matt: So Pike is unconscious. Scanlan?
Sam: I'm okay.
Matt: You're okay? What's your hit points?
Sam: I healed myself last time just the amount of hit points I have right now.
Matt: (laughs) Keyleth, where you at?
Marisha: I'm at 36. Luckily I also healed myself up.
Liam: I'm a field medic. I'll get you out.
Matt: All right, and for the rest of Vorugal's turn...
Laura: What the fuck are you doing now, Matthew?
Marisha: This isn't good.
Laura: Are you unconscious, too?
Marisha: I'm up, but Pike isn't, correct?
Matt: Pike is currently unconscious, yeah. That ends Vorugal's turn. Grog, you're up.
Sam: You're not unconscious, Marisha?
Marisha: I'm not. Pike is. There is an exit door. We can literally toss Pike's ass in the door. How many are you down, Pike?
Travis: Can I go to a frenzied rage and unload on Yenk?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Okay. This will be reckless attack. Great weapon master. Because fuck it. Why not? 28 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Natural 20. (shouting)
Ashley: Get him.
Travis: And 27 for the third.
Matt: Yeah, all three hit. The middle one gets critical. Don't forget your additional 1d4 damage with your axe because you're enlarged.
Marisha: And those were all great weapon master? That's fucking awesome!
Travis: The first one is 15 plus six points of necrotic damage. 21.
Matt: Including the 1d4?
Travis: 25.
Matt: 25. Does that includes the ten for great weapon master?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: So 35 points of damage on the first strike. All right. Second attack, which is the critical.
Laura: All dice are doubled? Is that how it works?
Matt: Yeah, all dice rolls double. Roll a d12, plus d6, plus d4.
Travis: That's an 11. It's a six. One.
Matt: 18 times two. (laughs) 36 plus ten. 46, plus 2d12 because of brutal critical.
Travis: One. Six. Seven. Seven extra points.
Matt: Plus 46. 53 points of damage with the second strike. Roll damage for the third one.
Liam: Maniac! Here it is! Get it!
Sam: Finally, he gets to attack! It's been six months since we've seen you actually attack anything.
Laura: I know, and he kills everything.
Liam: This is a rage spanking, right here.
Travis: 28 on the third one.
Matt: 28 on the third. Nice. You did over 100 damage on one round of melee combat.
Laura: Did you add your ten to the final one? It was 38 on the final.
Matt: (laughs) Jesus! So as you angrily get up, your large, draconic form, you rush forward, stepping right up to where Yenk is slamming into you. And after goring you in the chest, you embrace the anger and (impacts) bring the axe down, right into the inside of the shoulder. For the final attack, you put a foot up and drag it down across, cutting into it. You see a bunch of black-blue blood scatter across the snow, darkening it, the snow immediately melting with a (sizzling) hissing sound as it impacts with the ground around you. Yenk looks visibly hurt now. He's like, (pained grunts).
Laura: Can we see a little spire poking through its belly?
Matt: No, but you do see that the red, beady, coal-like flame eyes of Yenk are now burning with a vibrant red and are focused entirely on you.
Travis: I've got everything you want, big boy.
Matt: All right. That ends Grog's turn, I believe? Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Me? Oh, shit. Okay.
Matt: Actually, at the end of Grog's turn, Vorugal is going to use one of his legendary actions to attempt a tail attack, which has a reach of 20 feet. You are within 20 feet.
Sam: Against me?
Matt: Yep. That is cocked. 18 plus 14 is 32?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: You take (counting) 16 points of bludgeoning damage.
Sam: I'm going to use Cutting Words to reduce the damage. As I see the tail coming, I pick up my book of Shakespeare insults, and I will say: with thy brawls, thou hast disturbed our sport! I love thee not. Therefore, pursue me not.
Matt: As the tail swings towards you, roll a d12.
Sam: Six. And I live. (laughter)
Sam: It was 14 points of damage?
Matt: It was seven plus eight, so it would have been 16. It was eight plus eight. 16.
Sam: So reduced to ten. I'm okay. I have four points left.
Matt: Oh shit!
Sam: My turn?
Matt: Now it's your turn.
Sam: I look at Pike, and with my bonus action, I will heal her. Healing Word, second level. I will sing to her, (singing) you're trying to kill a white dragon, just like the ones we used to kill. May your days be merry and bright, and I hope we all survive this fight. (speaking) Okay, so 2d4, right?
Matt: 2d4 plus six.
Sam: 13 points.
Matt: Pike is up 13 points.
Sam: Shit. I've got to get out of here. Are you okay, Pike?
Ashley: I am at 13.
Sam: Are you going to be okay?
Ashley: Well, I'm going to run away. I'll be fine.
Marisha: Don't forget, you can go in the mansion. Pop in the mansion to heal.
Sam: I don't want to be a coward.
Laura: You can be a coward, Scanlan. It's okay.
Ashley: You're at four, Scanlan.
Sam: Shit. Well, I'll move away from it. Wait, I'm within its melee?
Matt: Yes, you are within range.
Sam: Jesus. That far away?
Matt: It has a 15-foot bite reach, a ten-foot claw reach, and a 20-foot tail reach.
Sam: Oh my god. Okay. I don't want to hit it. I don't want to go away. Fuck. I don't want to leave my Pikey. I'm not going to leave my Pikey. You never leave your wingman. No.
Laura: Four, Scanlan! Get somewhere safe. That way, you can keep helping her.
Marisha: If he takes you down and multi-attacks you, he could kill you. You healed her, right? She's conscious now.
Sam: I Dimension Door away.
Matt: To where?
Sam: Over in Yenkville, but not in Yenk range.
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Yeah, there you go.
Travis: In Yenk-adjacent?
Sam: Yeah. The suburbs of Yenkville.
Liam: Mighty Yenky has struck out.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Vax.
Liam: I know that from here to here, I'm 100 feet, so from the angle, am I 180 feet away to Pike?
Matt: Scanlan, by the way, I need you to make two concentration saving throws. Make two constitution saves.
Sam: With advantage?
Matt: Well, it's one of them with advantage, so roll twice.
Sam: I rolled twice. One was a 17 and one was a ten.
Matt: Yeah, even with the bonuses, Bigby's Hand is gone.
Taliesin: It would have been 19.
Matt: You took full damage from the last blast, so that would have been 72. Half of that would have been-- you had to roll a 36.
Liam: I want to save one action to grab Pike and yank her, so that means I have an action and a bonus action and movement to fly a total of 360 feet, halved, which is 180 feet to Pike, like a rocket. Grab her and roll into the door of the mansion.
Matt: Okay, so as you dart past and grab her--
Laura: Oh, does he get an attack of opportunity on you because you fly by?
Liam: I can arc.
Matt: You're then taking your action to grab her.
Liam: And roll us into the door.
Matt: Okay. You are leaving his combat range in doing so, so he's going to get his attack of opportunity on you, as part of his bite strike against you. That is 18 plus 14, so 32.
Liam: That hits. Do I have momentum, grabbing her?
Matt: If it drops you, you drop, and you drop with her.
Liam: I would imagine I did this. That's the intention. Up and over.
Matt: I understand that. The attack of a bite is going to change your trajectory of a dragon slashing at you. That is eight--
Liam: I'm out, dude. I've got five hit points.
Matt: Total would be eight plus eight, plus an additional 4d6 cold damage. Yeah. You grab Pike. As you begin to try to make the way, the bite snatches into you and lifts you up and throws you to the ground next to Pike, and you're both there on the ground.
Liam: But he bit me, right?
Matt: Yes, didn't bite Pike. You're both right outside of the door right now.
Sam: Pike's alive, and she's super strong.
Marisha: I'm just watching everybody barrel to my feet?
Matt: Kind of, yeah.
Laura: My boyfriend!
Matt: That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Fuck. I'm going to try to get his attention and say, hey, stupid! And then I'm going to hit him because that's all I've got.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Laura: 22?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: Do I have sneak attack on him, at all? Marisha is next to him.
Matt: No, he's within range for Marisha. Marisha is not threatening him, at the moment.
Laura: So no sneak attack, although I was hidden at the end of last turn.
Matt: You were. He did not see you.
Ashley: I'm threatening him.
Matt: (laughs) You're growling at him.
Laura: (counting) 28 on the first.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: That was damage. And then the second attack hits. It's a 31. (counting)
Matt: These are sharpshooter shots? It's the 1d10, plus bonus--
Laura: 1d8, plus eight, plus two for dragon, plus Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Right, there we go. Second one is how much damage?
Laura: 24, with two lighting damage. The first one had four lightning damage.
Matt: Okay. Does that end your turn?
Laura: (sighs) I want to help, I just don't know what I can do. That's all I can keep doing. I'm going to use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Go for it. Roll a stealth check.
Laura: Like an asshole. 13.
Matt: Okay. End of your turn, Vorugal's going to use his second legendary action and is going to swing around with the tail over the top of the rock (impact) to slam down on the conscious Pike. You are prone. It has advantage on the attack roll against you. That is 28 to hit.
Ashley: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Ashley: I'm out.
Matt: Pike's now unconscious. Okay. Vorugal is now in this ravenous, primal rage, and is trying to finish things off successively that have been a problem. Now, with that, both of them are unconscious on the ground, Scanlan's out of the picture, Keyleth is still standing right by the side of the tree. Pike, you're up next, so I need you to go ahead and roll a death saving throw. Roll a d20.
Taliesin: This is where being at the end of everything is great.
Liam: 20.
Matt: A 20? Natural 20? You are stabilized. You gain one hit point. You're conscious.
Marisha: Holy shit. That changes everything!
Ashley: I'll take that hit point. Okay. I don't even know what that means.
Matt: You're conscious again. The tail slams you, and you go out, and then as the tail pulls away, (gasps) you catch yourself again. Your turn's over, but you're back. Pulling the tail back. That's the end of your turn.
Ashley: I didn't do anything.
Matt: Your turn was the death saving throw. You take that at the end of your turn. You woke up at the end of it. At the end of your turn, Vorugal uses the third and final legendary action for this round and with a 20-foot range, is going to swing the tail around, breaking through the tree, towards Keyleth. That is a 29 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah. Wait, is this melee? Does this come into play with the cloak? So you're at disadvantage.
Matt: That is a 24. Ancient dragon, sorry. That is 22 points of bludgeoning damage.
Marisha: And that's it? I'm still alive! (roars) 22? Okay. I have 14 hit points.
Matt: All right. Now it's your turn, Keyleth.
Marisha: Now it's my turn.
Liam: Go earth elemental!
Marisha: I'm so torn, you guys. Do I heal you guys, or do I do damage and go earth elemental? It's a big decision. Scanlan?
Sam: It's all on you.
Marisha: Pike, you're at one?
Ashley: I'm at one.
Marisha: You're down.
Travis: I'm doing real good.
Marisha: What do I do, guys? Do I try and kill him, or do I heal?
Sam: You've got two nearly dead people right next to you who are feet away from a mansion.
Laura: Can you Grasping Vine them through the mansion door? It's open, right?
Matt: The vine wouldn't pull them through the door because you can only create it within a space where a natural plant would grow.
Marisha: It doesn't work like that, unfortunately.
Sam: But you can throw them, as a beasty elemental.
Matt: What are you going to do, Keyleth? Hurry up.
Marisha: Okay, fuck!
Sam: When I left the mansion, I locked it.
Travis: Did the key break off when you locked it?
Sam: No, it's a code lock. And I forgot the code!
Marisha: I'm going to cast Sunbeam. I'm going to beam in his face.
Sam: On Yenk, of course.
Marisha: It's okay. I've got this. Beam in his face.
Matt: Okay, so you cast Sunbeam. 60-foot line, five-foot wide. Right past that way. Okay.
Taliesin: Actually, does that hit both of them?
Marisha: 60 foot, right through them? Can I?
Matt: You might have to reposition to do so.
Marisha: What, scooch over one? Yeah, I'll scooch over one. Take a side step to line them up.
Matt: You get around the tree and past the rock. Yeah, you can hit both of them.
Marisha: They have to make a constitution save.
Matt: Vorugal, that is a 32. Yenk is a 27. They both make it.
Marisha: Well, they still take half damage. It's 6d8. Normally, they take full damage and they're blinded. It would have been way cooler if it would have worked. Ooh, that's a good roll. 26 points of radiant damage.
Matt: 26, then halved?
Marisha: Then halved. And then I'm going to go air elemental form.
Matt: Embracing the age-old tradition of the Air Ashari, Keyleth vanishes into a form of swirling wind, picking up the various bits of sleet and snow around you. You're almost like a slushy tornado.
Marisha: That's cool. Can I then take whatever movement I have left to try and drag--
Matt: You've already used your action to cast the spell, unfortunately.
Marisha: I can't use my movement to try and move someone?
Matt: You can use your movement to move. To pull somebody with you--
Marisha: That's an action?
Liam: It's all right. I'm fine.
Marisha: Then I'm going to use my movement to go airborne. I think I can go 60 feet? Let me see my fly speed. I have 90 feet.
Matt: 90 feet, so it would be 45 feet up, if you want to.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Kick him on the way up, and then he'll follow you.
Marisha: I give him a little air poof kick in the face, just for flavor.
Matt: Sure, why not?
Marisha: He's getting slushied in the face.
Matt: You rush up into the air. Vorugal does not get an attack of opportunity because he already used his reaction against you. So you (whoosh) without an issue.
Marisha: I hope that was right.
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Percy.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to take my three shots.
Matt: Right above you, you see Raishan, wings beating, looking over and assessing the battlefield. You see Vorugal down there, bloody. You see Yenk, bloodied. Both engaged and distracted. You are currently not in either of their attentive sphere.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to reload. I'm going to take my three shots at the white dragon with what I have left. I can do nothing. That's 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Taliesin: One necrotic. 12 points, with one necrotic. Shot number one. Next shot, same thing. Standard shot. That ran, but 22? Oh, sorry. It's not 22. I'm so tired. 17. That misses.
Matt: 17 misses, unfortunately. It hits the side, but the shot shatters across the dragonhide.
Ashley: Can I do War God's Blessing from where I'm at?
Matt: You know what? Hold on, Percy. You are conscious on the ground, barely paying attention, and all of a sudden, you hear the shot go off, and you see it about to blast against the hide. As a war cleric? I'll see if he has to be within range, or if it's one of the things that you can do if he attacks an enemy. The creature has to be within 30 feet of you, so no. He's way too far.
Taliesin: 24 for the next shot.
Matt: Third one does hit.
Taliesin: That's 12 points, with two points of necrotic. And I'm going to grab my rope, and I'm going to wave at the green dragon and start dropping down.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I have a rope.
Matt: I know you do. As you leap off the side, the clench in the stone (tink) comes loose, and you (impacts) tumble down the hill. I need you to make an acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Yeah! I can do that, even at negative one, I can do that. No, I can't. That was a one.
Matt: Natural one? You tumble Homer Simpson-style (repeated impacts) down the icy, rocky side, landing prone and suffering 18 points of bludgeoning damage on the way, landing prone on the ground. (impact, groan)
Taliesin: Fine!
Matt: Kima's turn. Kima's going to go and flank Yenk against Grog, giving her advantage on her first attack. Yeah, that's a 25 to hit, and her second attack is-- yeah, both hit. The first strike with her Holy Thunder Maul. 19 points of damage against the goristro, and she's going to burn another 3rd-level spell to do a holy smite at third level. All righty. 23 additional radiant damage on top of that, and then her second strike, she's going to burn her last 3rd-level spell to do another smite. That is 16. (counting) 31. Nice! Yeah, she did a lot of damage on that round. Slamming twice with the maul into the backside of Yenk. The first one slams into the shoulder, sending him to the ground with his fist. (grunts) He starts getting back up. She spins, using the inertia, and slams the maul into the side of his knee, which pops out and sends him down onto one knee now, and Yenk is basically half-prostrate in front of you, Grog, preparing for your next round of combat. (growls) Ending Kima's turn. It is now Raishan's turn.
Travis: She made him bend the knee.
Matt: Raishan does not get the breath back. However, is going to fly. Not used to the ice and can't quite get to full speed there, but can get close enough to attempt a Blight spell, at the very least. Vorugal fails. That's an 18. Yeah, fails the save.
Laura: Blight spell.
Marisha: A lot of damage. Come on.
Sam: He's going to resist it.
Taliesin: He might have burned it.
Matt: Yeah, burning a legendary resistance to make it happen, so it still makes the save, so it's still half, but it has one left. Okay, so it takes 18 points of necrotic damage. That's the end of that turn. It is now Yenk's turn. Yenk is going to do a full-on multiattack against you, Grog. That is a 24 to hit?
Travis: That'll hit.
Matt: Actually, it has advantage on you because you used reckless attack. That hits. Second one is 26 to hit.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And natural 20. All right.
Travis: I'm going to use my Stone's Endurance on the natural 20, and I'll do retaliation on one of those three hits.
Sam: Retaliation? That's new.
Matt: So the first fist is 29 points of piercing damage, so reduce that to 14, plus three points of fire damage as the fist suddenly bursts into flame as it slams into you. The secondary fist comes swinging around the other way, dealing 20 points of piercing damage, reduced to ten. Plus, you take eight points of lightning damage as suddenly an arc of energy streaks from the fist, slamming into the other side of your face, as you're taking it on each side. As you grin, he leaps up into the air, his strong, thick legs getting almost up above you, then kicks down with its hooves towards you like a very angry goat. This is the critical.
Laura: What does stone's endurance do?
Travis: d12 plus my constitution modifier.
Matt: Reduce the damage, yeah.
Taliesin: I've been hit by a goat in the face before. No, really. I got nailed by a goat.
Liam: At the zoo?
Taliesin: No, we were filming this ridiculous television series called Hell Town when I was a kid. It was awful.
Liam: You weren't trying to call Satan?
Taliesin: Not in the show, either.
Matt: 46 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 23, plus ten points of ice damage as the hooves slam into you, leaving these frozen cracks where the blood should be emanating from. It seals the wound, almost.
Travis: 14, so I reduce that by 14.
Matt: Correct, reduce that by 14, and then make your retaliatory strike.
Travis: Great weapon master, reckless.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: 26?
Matt: That hits.
Travis: 22.
Laura: Plus ten.
Travis: 32.
Matt: 32 points of damage. How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Marisha: Yeah, Grog! Get me that staff!
Travis: When he jumped up and did the hoof kick down, I'm going to take it and then grab his hooves and wishbone him. (cheering)
Matt: As you grab him, you try to begin to pull, and he slams onto the ground, and you see him grab his arms back to try and pull himself back up. You kick him straight down again, and as you laugh, you push your foot into his crotch area as you pull Yenk in half with a sheer show of strength, smearing you with black, burning blood. It does burn you. You do suffer five points of fire damage as the blood that's spurting on you is burning into the skin. You tear him mostly in half. You can see the innards spilling into the snow and melting the snow within a five-foot radius of you as he (death rattle) is still surviving as you pull him apart. As you get closer, he reaches forward and grabs you and palms your head with his last bit of strength and begins to squeeze, and then the fingers eventually go lax before the hand (impact) onto the ground.
Travis: I look at both of the legs in my hands, and I look at Kima and go, which one's lucky?
Matt: She goes, "You are." (laughter)
Matt: That ends Yenk's turn.
Sam: Hey, Matt. Can I rewind?
Matt: No. Sorry. Yenk is done and torn open on the ground.
Marisha: Now we have to deal with the two dragons.
Laura: Well, one. Hopefully.
Taliesin: Yeah, we're going to let one leave. One's going to walk.
Matt: Vorugal is going to go ahead and (whoosh) come up and then--
Sam: Does Pike get an attack of opportunity?
Matt: Pike is not currently threatening him. Yeah, with Raishan blasting and seeing the dragon, Vorugal is going to turn this way, behind this space underneath the air elemental. "You betrayer!" (roars) And unleash a blast of frozen death down, hitting Raishan, as well as Vax and Pike. You're unconscious. Vax, you fail a death saving throw automatically.
Marisha: I thought Pike had one hit point.
Matt: RIght. If you make the save, you're still taking 30-something cold damage, so you're down. Automatic one fail on a death saving throw. Raishan does not make the save and takes 72 points of ice damage. Yeah, that's going to end Vorugal's turn, very angrily. All right, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: Yeah. Can I make a quick look down? Do I see any Spire of Conflux?
Matt: Make a quick investigation check.
Travis: In my rage? Natural one. I'm going to take off running toward Vorugal!
Matt: That's as far as you can get on your full movement.
Travis: I'll dash to get as far as I can.
Matt: Yeah, you can get about there. All right, that ends Grog's turn. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I will bonus action take my potion of greater healing, right? That's the medium one?
Matt: Yeah. It's 4d4 plus four.
Sam: Okay. Terrible. Okay. Oh man, that's terrible.
Laura: What did you get?
Sam: 11 total.
Travis: From which potion?
Laura: Greater.
Sam: Okay. Well, shit. I'll move towards the dragon a bit.
Matt: Actually, Percy, make a concentration check, if you could. Make a constitution saving throw for Hex, yeah. Forgot about that.
Taliesin: Constitution saving? That would be a negative one? No, not a negative one. Add negative one. That would be 15.
Matt: 15. For you to take half damage? Yeah. Hex stays. All right. Scanlan?
Sam: There are no options. Not to save our friends! I'm way out of range.
Laura: Can you Dimension Door and then run with her?
Sam: I'm done. I've moved. I've acted. I can throw a ball. I'll throw a Fireball at Big Whitey. Centered way back so it doesn't hit any of my friends.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Sam: Three charges, I guess. What do I do? I just do it.
Matt: That's a natural 20 on his save, so he does make his save.
Sam: What I was going to say, I rewind. Because you didn't let me, he has disadvantage on his save this time, because you didn't let me retroactively go back and do it.
Matt: That's right. Natural one. 20, one.
Travis: Are you kidding me?
Marisha: Burn this motherfucker!
Travis: Every time we have one of these big fights--
Taliesin: There's no middle ground, is there? There's no middle ground at all.
Matt: To be fair, we do a lot of rolls in these big fights.
Travis: We do, but a straight 20 to one flip-flop only happens one time.
Sam: 29.
Marisha: That's pretty good. That's okay.
Matt: (explosion) The explosion hits. You see it sends ice shards shooting everywhere, leaving a big crater on the ground where the snow once was, and part of the stonework is barely scratched. The blast hits Vorugal, and Vorugal (grunts). Looks down at the two unconscious bodies on the ground. Looks up at Raishan. (huffs) Does that end your turn?
Sam: Yes.
Matt: End of your turn, it's going to use two actions to do a wing attack, beating its wings, hitting every creature within 15 feet. You're out of range, actually, Marisha. Grog, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Travis: I think I have advantage on this because of rage. I do. 21.
Matt: 21? That unfortunately fails. You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, and you're knocked prone. Also, Pike and Vax, you both fail a death saving throw from the bludgeoning winds of the ice dragon's wings beating downward.
Marisha: You guys are at two failed?
Laura: He's at two failed. Pike's at one.
Matt: Vorugal is going to head upward and begin flying this direction to turn tail and flee.
Sam: Do you get an attack because he's flying by you?
Marisha: Yeah, do I get an attack of opportunity here?
Sam: You are right over him.
Matt: You were right over him. As he gets up, I'll give you one. I don't have any more of these things here.
Liam: Blow everything you've got. Blow it. He's leaving. Unleash.
Marisha: Can I do a spell attack on him? It's just melee, right?
Matt: That's specifically a War Caster feat ability.
Marisha: Just one slam attack? Nope. Definitely not.
Taliesin: How fast? Is he still within visual range?
Matt: Currently, yeah. He just moved 40 feet with that one reaction.
Laura: We can still hit him with the ranged?
Matt: Possibly, yeah. That ends Scanlan's turn. Vax, I need you make a death saving throw. You have advantage.
Sam: Advantage?
Liam: 17.
Matt: So you're okay for now. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to hit him twice.
Marisha: Fucking burn this guy down!
Taliesin: Hit him with everything we've got.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27 hits.
Laura: 25 on the first.
Matt: 25 damage? All right, and the second hit?
Laura: The second is also 27.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Marisha: We're going to live!
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: He's taking away, and you have a shot as it's arcing to the right of you, bleeding and limping in the air, but managing to pick up speed. The sleet and snow is strong and firing around you.
Laura: I want to see a cut on his stomach where Yenk left a hole, and I want to go straight into his heart.
Matt: The first arrow, you aim for it. It streaks off and hits another wound and gets jammed in. You pull back with the second arrow, and right as you see the snow beginning to blind, the one moment of clarity that hits you, (arrow firing) you release the arrow, piercing inside where the wound was, where one of Yenk's horns had gashed into the front of his chest. Vorugal (roars) and spins into a corkscrew, plummets and crashes into the side of the ravine, tumbles backward. Rocks come tumbling onto it. Vorugal hits the ground, smacked open. As it begins to get back up, (impacts) a bunch of rocks slam down, and one big shard of ice (impacts) slams into it. (panting) Still writhing in place as he's bleeding out.
Laura: And a tree grows out of his guts.
Matt: He's still currently holding on as he's jammed to the ground. You see the bluish-purple blood leaking out the side of the mouth. (panting) It can't move, and you can see the strength leaving Vorugal's body. Raishan swoops up next to Vorugal's corpse, leaning over. (cackles) "Tell your master on the other side, when you see him, that it was worth it." And Raishan sinks her teeth into his throat and tears it out. You see the spray of blood across Raishan's mouth and across the front of the ravine as Vorugal's body falls limp onto the ground. Spits the chunk of white dragon flesh onto the bottom of the ravine. The green dragon spins around, facing you all. "Well done." And backs into a sitting position. The wings furl down and fold into her side. "Take your spoils. It seems the war is nigh."
Taliesin: There will be a conversation.
Travis: I run as fast as I can over to Pike and Vax.
Taliesin: I run to the body of the big demonic thing and start going through it.
Matt: Okay, roll an investigation check.
Travis: I have two basic potions. I de-cork both of them and shove them in their gullets.
Matt: While that's happening, in the time it takes you guys to rush over, I need you both to make one more death saving throw.
Marisha: Oh, fuck. Come on, you guys.
Liam: A ten and a three! (laughter)
Taliesin: Not funny!
Ashley: 11.
Matt: Grog comes by, scoops you both up, and force-feeds you two basic healing potions. You both come to consciousness bruised, beaten, but apparently the current struggle is done, though you're now shivering, cold, soaked through. All of you, the elements have really sunk in once the adrenaline begins to wear off.
Laura: I fly down and cast Cure Wounds on Vax.
Travis: The two of you, inside the mansion. Now.
Matt: How much do your potions heal for them? It's 1d4 plus four. Sorry, 2d4 plus two.
Marisha: Yes, we do.
Taliesin: Vex, we have a dragon to disassemble.
Marisha: You go. I'm the one who's good at harvesting.
Travis: Six.
Matt: Plus two, eight. You heal eight, Vax.
Travis: Eight.
Laura: Get inside, now.
Matt: So seven to Pike.
Laura: I'm going to fly over and try to help Percy, now that they're safe.
Taliesin: I got a 16.
Matt: 16, you healed?
Taliesin: No, 16 to investigate.
Matt: As you start peering through, you can see there's an intestinal tract that's covered in thorns. It's a very weird, fucked-up alien creature, based on any sort of anatomic understanding. As you pull back, you can find there's one rigid portion of the inside of its intestinal tract that is swollen and looks to have this weird black, pulsing mass that surrounds it, like it's infected perpetually.
Taliesin: I pull out my sword and cut it out.
Matt: As you pull it back, you can see there are actual vines and ivy that have begun to grow inside its abdomen. You tear back and pull it, and as soon as you cut back the rest of the muscle that's currently tensing it in, the muscle almost instinctually pulls back, all the tension lost, and it almost fires this staff-like entity out. It shoots outward, and you have to dodge to the side immediately. You see that it's strangely pristine amongst all the crimson and gore. The blood of this creature does not even touch its surface. A twisted series of clumped-together thorny vines that form this curvature at the top. A singular yellowish-green gem in the center that hovers, locked in place by no noticeable force. It's there, jutting out of the body of the creature.
Marisha: I run to Percy.
Taliesin: I walk to you. We're walking to the dragon, anyway. I hand it to you. Your majesty.
Laura: I land next to them. Oh my god. Let's get inside. (offscreen clatter)
Marisha: That's right!
Taliesin: Karma's a bitch!
Liam: Vorugal ain't shit!
Matt: You all rush into the inside of the mansion?
Marisha: I don't, immediately.
Taliesin: We're finishing up the harvesting, and I go to talk to Raishan really quickly.
Laura: I stay out, and I search more around Yenk.
Taliesin: I'm sending you to work on the dragon.
Marisha: I'm coming with you to have that conversation.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: I'm coming with you to have that conversation.
Sam: I will come, as well, to make sure Keyleth doesn't kill anyone.
Taliesin: Thank you. You've earned a conversation. We'll see you at home. You should get there quickly so there's no suspicion.
Sam: What's home?
Taliesin: We don't say it.
Matt: "Very well. I hope that perhaps this display of intent has quelled some of your worries. I'll see you at home, then." The form shifts down to that of Asum, closes the eyes for a second, and the form shifts as you see a sudden glyph appear beneath, and vanishes.
Taliesin: That was not a fight we were about to have.
Marisha: (sighs heavily) I silently go and start harvesting the white dragon.
Laura: Did you see how weak she was, compared to Vorugal?
Marisha: Let's just hope she stays that way. I start harvesting the white dragon as much as I can.
Liam: I'm going to find Larkin.
Sam: Send up a signal flare.
Laura: I take an empty potion bottle out and get some of Yenk's blood and put it in the cold.
Matt: Okay. As you're doing that, too, you're noticing that Yenk's body is rapidly decomposing. Its form is dissolving from the inside.
Marisha: I try as fast as I can-- wait, from who?
Taliesin: I'm going to run over and try and pull anything from Yenk.
Matt: I figure, for the fact that it's near midnight, we can begin next game working out the logistics of what you've managed to harvest with the rolls and such. We'll pick up from here next time. That was intense, guys. Well done.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Sam: Perfectly executed plan.
Taliesin: It really was. It actually was. How was this terrible?
Travis: That couldn't have gone any worse in the beginning. They hit each other maybe once, and then it was all on!
Matt: Actually, they did some pretty decent-- I think Yenk did close to 100 points of damage before you guys even engaged Vorugal.
Marisha: Can I see it?
Matt: (laughing) Can you see it?
Marisha: I really don't want to wait a week.
Matt: Sure. You can go ahead and have a look at your Spire of Conflux. You earned it.
Taliesin: Good work, girl.
Marisha: I didn't think I was going to get one, you guys!
Matt: Well, guys. Well done. You've now taken three of the five Chroma Conclave dragons, and with the death of Vorugal, pretty much are spearheading the final push to Thordak.
Liam: Is Thordak scared yet?
Matt: We'll find out. (chuckles) Well, guys. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night. Thank you for those who stuck around for as late as this epic battle went. I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
Travis: Glad Pike was here for the fight! (cheering)
Marisha: Sarenrae!
Matt: Divine Intervention! Punched Vorugal into the dirt, man.
Laura: Thank you, Loot Crate.
Matt: Thank you, Loot Crate for being awesome sponsors. Thank you, Critters for being such amazing people and for being so supportive of the community and the show and the story and making your own stories. We're so happy and so proud to have you with us. Be sure to check out the many charities that we support: 826LA, as well as all of our individual charities. You can look up the Critter's Guide to Critmas and see the list of them there. Thank you so much. Have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? See you guys next week. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Sound: (no audio)
Sam: -- is today's sponsor. A leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over 30 years. That's almost as old as I am. Do you like magic? Pirates? Knives? Royals and adventure? Then check out Shades of Magic, the series from Tor Books. The conclusion of which, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so check out the full three-book series. Go to, there's a promo link somewhere on this page-- I'm gonna say right there. Let's say right there.
Travis: Yeah, sure!
Sam: So check that out. And the thing about sponsors, guys, is we really need to show them our love. And really show them that we appreciate what they do for us every week. They're a big part of the show, without them we would-- For instance, without sponsors, Taliesin would only be able to dye his hair platinum blond or brown.
Taliesin: Oh, no.
Marisha: It's true.
Taliesin: It's called Malibu Sunset.
Sam: Yeah. Laura's dice budget would go way down. Instead of throwing away 250 dice a week, it would maybe be more like 240, 230.
Laura: Oh God. Terrible.
Sam: I mean, Liam might have to go back to shaving his beard and selling the beard shavings to those in need.
Matt: To be fair, it was worth it. Look at them on my shelf.
Sam: I have just a few ideas for ways that you guys could show your love for our sponsors. Take them out for a candlelit dinner. I'm not talking Bennigan's, I'm talking something high-end. Shake Shack, Outback, maybe even P.F. Chang's. How about sending some romantic texts to spice things up? Keep it classy, like: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, I wish you could be with me right now. Or, I had a dream last night, and Critical Role Sponsor? You were in it. And hey, compliments always help. Critical Role Sponsor, do you have a map? 'Cause I'm getting lost in your eyes. Or: Hey, Critical Role Sponsor, of all the beautiful curves on your body, I'm most in love with your smile. Or even: Critical Role Sponsor, on a scale of one to ten, you're a nine, and I'm the one you need.
Marisha: Don't use that one, either, in real life.
Taliesin: That would work on me.
Sam: Or you could just go to their website and buy their products. (all cheer)
Sam: So, Tor Books, thanks so much.
Matt: Thank you, Tor Books, and thank you to all those mentioned restaurants that will never be a sponsor for us now, and it's probably for the best.
Travis: The Bennigan's and the Monte Cristo.
Laura: Oh man, I hit up Bennigan's a lot.
Matt: I know, I was holding out for the P.F. Chang's but, y'know. Thank you so much, Sam, and thank you, Tor Books, for being our awesome sponsor tonight. Make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, now available to you. All right, next up, the new episode of GM Tips is out. It came out today and this one is about suggestions on homebrewing content for your systems in game. I have, I think, three more episodes that are going on in the coming weeks, so look forward to those.
Marisha: And then we hand it off to someone awesome.
Matt: Exactly. We have a new person stepping in, after those episodes, showing their own flavor to the series. I'm excited about that.
Marisha: Because you can only learn so much from one teacher.
Matt: Exactly.
Marisha: The best teachers will teach you that.
Matt: Yep.
Travis: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles only had Master Splinter.
Marisha: Shut. Up.
Travis: Daniel-san only had Mr. Miyagi.
Marisha: This is the real world, okay? This isn't fantasy.
Sam: They were homeschooled, okay?
Matt: And how many times did they have to reboot that to make it work?
Travis: That's a good point.
Matt: Eventually ending with the Michael Bay films. So check out that episode of GM Tips. As a reminder to all you guys looking to homebrew: It's hard. It's time consuming. It's not for everybody.
Laura: But it's so rewarding, Matthew.
Matt: It can be rewarding.
Liam: Could you do it different though?
Matt: Ugh. So check out the episode knowing that, and we'll have next week's episode next Wednesday.
Taliesin: Your other friends tell me that they miss you too. So yeah.
Marisha: Mm-hm. That's true.
Matt: Yeah, I know. I'll see people again soon. Also, I wanted to give a shout-out. We're in the final 24-hour stretch for the Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire crowdsourced campaign. So if you haven't yet, or you have interest in seeing the sequel to that, go and check it out. They're doing a final 24-hour stream over on Obsidian's stream channel, of course after our episode tonight. Go give them some love. And last, I have my list here, I was just able to announce that I voice Deadshot in the upcoming Justice 2. (all cheer)
Matt: Coming out in mid-May.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Matt: Yeah! Fantástico! So look forward to that. There may be some more surprises as the cast is announced progressively down the road. Super happy to be a part of it.
Laura: Super happy.
Taliesin: (groan)
Marisha: (groan)
Matt: I need more alcohol. (all laugh)
Travis: Immediately.
Matt: Immediately. Taliesin, you wanted to mention something about your new show?
Taliesin: Yeah, we had the very first episode of The Wednesday Club this week.
Travis: Yeah!
Taliesin: I have now had eight hours of sleep, which is pretty magical.
Marisha: It was so good.
Taliesin: It was fun. And we're gonna be back this week with our next episode. We're actually gonna be talking about a lot of things, including characters with mental health issues in comic books, both superhero and otherwise. Including Legion, from the X-Men, who has currently got a show on FX which is magical.
Travis: Yeah he does. It's really good.
Matt: It's really, really good. Holy shit.
Taliesin: It's so good. So tune in, it's noon 'til two on Wednesdays, on the twitch stream where you probably are right now.
Matt: Noon 'til two Pacific.
Taliesin: And I think we bumped it to Alpha, but I don't remember, maybe not. And then it'll be on the rebroadcast if you wanna see it, but it's gonna be a lot of fun. Matt Key and Amy Dallen will be there, it's gonna be great.
Matt: Cool. Thank you, Taliesin. If nobody else has anything else to say...
Travis: Cheese is for everybody. Not just me.
Sam: Did you just say Jesus for everybody?
Travis: Cheese.
Marisha: Cheez Its?
Liam: Jesus for everybody.
Matt: Cheezits Christ for everybody.
Travis: Cheez Its Crust. (all laugh)
Matt: Without further ado, let's bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role. (opening credits)
Matt: Hello, and welcome back. So, picking up where we last left off. Vox Machina, having defeated the Chroma Conclave, and restoring order and, for the time being, peace to the landscape of Tal'Dorei, resurrected your friend, Scanlan Shorthalt. However, he realised he needed some time to himself, to both connect with his interest in direction and life, and with his estranged illegitimate daughter, Kaylie. Upon leaving, the party proceeded to find their way to close all the loose ends that they hadn't quite had time to get to with the Conclave's assault. That involved returning the ashes of Senokir's wife to Vasselheim, and then making your way to Ank'Harel to deliver the hands of Ripley to the Scarbearers guild. On your way there you encountered a new adventurer, Taryon Darrington, who was looking to join an adventuring group for experience--
Liam: He's my favorite.
Matt: Yes, he's the best. He paid his way into your service and upon being returned to Whitestone you gave him a hazing, which broke him enough to be a little more honest with his reasoning for going on this adventure.
Laura: Let's not call it a hazing. It was an audition.
Matt: It was an audition, it was a brutal audition.
Marisha: (singing) Don't call it a comeback!
Matt: There you go. In which, knowing more about your new companion, you accepted him for the time being, understanding the dangers that are involved in following your path and he accepted. You made your way to Emon, looking as a way to find passage towards Vesrah, the home of the Water Ashari and the hopeful completion of Keyleth's AraMente. Upon finding and hiring a crew under the Captain Adella, you made your way onto your new ship and began to traverse westward onto the Ozmit Sea.
Travis: Shit, we're on a boat. We're on a boat motherfuckers!
Marisha: (singing) Don't you ever forget! (all laugh)
Matt: There is that.
Liam: We are noble creatures.
Matt: So.
Travis: (gasps) I hear the ocean.
Sam: That's someone snoring. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's a rainstick.
Matt: So you guys have been at sea for a handful of days. It's been relatively uneventful. The boat slowly rocks, as the waters of the Ozmit are much calmer by comparison to that of the Lucidian Ocean. Making them a much more popular trade route pass between the various continents on this side of Exandria. Now the slow rocking of the boat, across the somewhat choppy waters, leads some of you into a relaxing lull over these days. Others, into perpetual bouts of nausea. But you notice that Captain Adella runs a relatively tight ship. Her crew works like clockwork, at her order, and the skies are thankfully clear these first few days, and the journey so far is mild. What would you guys like to-- Is there anything you wish to accomplish as you are travelling across the sea?
Taliesin: I've got a little bit of sketching, and working on something simple, that I might even try and build while I'm here.
Marisha: I'll catch up on some reading, I guess. Some of my alchemy reading.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Stephen King novel.
Marisha: From I've been doing, trying to make that better.
Matt: Fair enough. Anyone else?
Liam: I have been sort of shadowing Grog for a couple of days, 'cause he doesn't have any gnomes to hang out with.
Travis: Oh that's right. Oh, fuck, it's real when you said it!
Liam: I have been playing Boulder, Parchment, Shears, and telling him stories.
Travis: The non-violent kind.
Liam: Yes, yes. Just hanging out, off and on.
Matt: Okay. Vex?
Laura: I guess I've been trying to get to know Tary a little bit better. And also flying like Vex-Kite behind the ship.
Matt: Okay. And Taryon?
Sam: Lots of push-ups, trying to beef up my pecs. I also, at the start of every day, I'm going to take two of those-- I have a bunch of silver coins that I carry around with me, and I'm gonna cast a couple of spells into them, just to have them at the ready. I cast Fly into one and Blur into the other.
Matt: Okay, good to know.
Sam: And then I would probably wander down to good old Percy, and just ask him if he needs help with any tinkering.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, no, I wanna see what he has, too. Like, there's gonna be some trading. I'll show stuff.
Matt: I'll show you mine, if you show me yours?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: Perfect. So, as the two tinkering nerds begin to reveal their secret inner interests, Vex, you, about three days into this venture, you catch what looks to be a dark spot right on the horizon. Midday, maybe like two o'clock in the afternoon, it's a warm sun, this far, as you start moving westward and southward, you head closer to what would be the equator of the planet. It's getting warmer, and the sea spray is coming up, the smell of seawater and brine occasionally meets your nose, as the ship hits the various waves as they come across, but you're still keeping a keen eye out. And it's just endless sea in all directions, you see no landmass, but you see a little bit of something appearing at the horizon.
Laura: Like land, potentially?
Matt: It could very well be land.
Laura: I guess I'll fly down and-- I'm gonna try and stay off the deck as much as possible, since it makes me so nauseous.
Matt: So you just glide around the--
Laura: Yes.
Travis: Your imaginary character is also nauseous.
Laura: Potentially, yes.
Travis: That's a bummer.
Laura: I know, right. Vex hasn't had a lot of experience with ships, you know.
Liam: Does your real self also get sea sick?
Laura: I may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime.
Travis: She painted the ocean. It was amazing.
Marisha: Ooh.
Laura: I'm gonna fly down and tell Captain Adella.
Matt: Okay. Keeping an eye out, and as you move, you catch a little more of the shape in the distance. It looks a little small to be a landmass. If it is landmass, it's a very small one.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: But it's stationary.
Laura: Oh, it could be another ship, possibly.
Matt: It could be a ship, it could be anything that would be stationary. Literally, it's only because of your keen vantage point, and your honed eyesight, that you're able to even make that slight, little bump in the horizon from here.
Laura: All right. Captain?
Matt: As you fly down, you see her, she's at the front of the ship. She has her one hand currently on the wheel, and she's looking out, chatting to the side with one of her crewmates, and turns around as you fly down next to her. She's surprised at your immediate appearance and she's like, "Oh, (gasps) sorry, I--"
Laura: You'll get used to that someday.
Matt: One of these days, I'm sure.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: "What can I do for you?"
Laura: I see something on the horizon; do you know of any masses in the area? Maybe a ship, or island, or--
Matt: "Take the helm." She hands off the wheel to one of her compatriots, and she rummages over in one of the small chests to the side, and pulls out a large scroll and slams it onto a table she keeps maybe ten feet off to the right of her. And she goes through and pulls out a few instruments. Marks the sun and takes a good five minutes or so getting a really strong idea of where the positioning is. She looks down. "No, not much in the way of landmasses out here, my dear."
Laura: Do you have a telescope?
Matt: She goes and pulls out her particular eye glass. It's small, but functional. Glances over, and you look over in the direction and point it out. There's nothing on the horizon.
Laura: May I take that and fly up? I swear I'll give it back.
Matt: There's a long pause--
Laura: I've got nowhere to hide.
Liam: Careful, butterfingers.
Matt: Passes it over.
Laura: Up.
Matt: You take off, look up, extend it, keeping a close view. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Travis: First one of the day.
Laura: (screams) First one, first one, first one. Which of you?
Travis: Set the tone. Roll like a champion.
Laura: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Liam: Natural one, the spyglass has fallen in the ocean.
Laura: Shut up, don't say it out loud!
Travis: Why did you go with the weenie one?
Laura: Shut up. 21?
Matt: 21? Okay. You take a moment and glance out in the same direction you were, and you scan past the horizon. Nothing.
Laura: Motherfuck. Well, I come back down. It went under water, whatever it was. Does that mean it was big enough to be some sort of sea monster? Was it a sea monster?
Matt: "I sincerely hope not, for all of our sakes. But, nevertheless, I'm gonna go ahead and have the men man our ballistas. Just to be safe."
Laura: How quickly do those things move?
Matt: "What things?"
Laura: Sea monsters.
Matt: "Depends on the sea monster."
Laura: This one was very large.
Matt: "Hopefully slowly." And she shouts off, "Full sail!" A bunch of the deckhands start pulling the ropes down, letting the sail come to a full-- flutter of wind itself isn't too terribly strong, but it's enough to at least inflate the sails even further, and give a little more of a speedy direction.
Laura: I wanna go back up and keep an eye, with the spyglass, on any kind of movement, that looks like it's coming towards us.
Matt: Okay, cool. Some of her men go over and start loading the large ballistas to the back of the ship. Anybody else hanging out on the deck?
Travis: Can I run to the bow of the ship? Heading for a new land.
Laura: Oh wow.
Travis: In New York you can-- No, sorry. (all laugh)
Travis: On the bow of the ship.
Matt: There you stand, at the bow of the ship. You see at the very front there's the point, the-- oh man.
Taliesin: Are you really?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Are-- you're not...
Travis: No, I'm just looking to see what I can see. Like one leg up, Captain Morgan style.
Matt: There you go. As you glance out, with your hand above on your brow, guarding the bright, cloudless sunlight down upon you, it is just endless ocean.
Travis: Is there one of those amazing naked ladies on the front of the ship? Holding out the pole, that comes out from the front?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Come on, Gil. Three. (all laugh)
Matt: It's still hard to see from this vantage point. You'll probably have to climb out there, and climb down in front of the ship to see.
Sam: He's in the back of the ship. (all laugh)
Travis: Do we mean to be going backwards?
Marisha: I go up to the deckhands who are manning the sails. Hi, heard it was full sail, full-- Do you need help with anything? To do-- you need--
Laura: Wow.
Marisha: I can make, like, wind.
Travis: Oh, you can!
Marisha: And we can maybe get there faster.
Matt: The gentleman who is there, currently wrapping a rope around his forearm, as he's pulling it down with his full weight, you can see he's maybe in his late twenties, though still going a little grey in the beard, for such a young age, but his skin is weathered, he's kind of missing a few teeth. He's got a large piece of-- like a bandana of cloth wrapped around the front of his head, and just a leather tunic. He kind of looks back to you. "Um, I've got it, but thank you."
Marisha: Oh, okay. 'Cause I can-- You're doing great. Good work.
Matt: Right, okay.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab Bad News and run up to the crow's nest and see if I can see anything.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Guess word has gotten around the ship then.
Matt: Yeah. Well, she did shout 'full sail,' I guess maybe you went up to see what was going on. You get up to the crow's nest. Go ahead and make a perception check.
Taliesin: Make some room in here. What is my perception? That's 20.
Matt: 20, okay. You get up there, lean out, getting a view, you can see maybe 45 feet up, Vex is also keeping her eye out via broom. Taking her lead, and the direction she's facing, you glance out in that direction, but it's just open sea.
Taliesin: I'm gonna keep an eye out for a moment, for a little bit.
Liam: Is Tary down below?
Sam: I was, but I came up too. Hi, hello, hi. I have one of those little sticker things you put on the back for motion sickness. (all laugh)
Sam: One of these.
Laura: One of those things you put on your wrist? Yeah.
Sam: Hi, good day, good day, all.
Travis: Bidet.
Sam: Good day, hi, hi. That's it. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I shout out to Percy, what are you guys looking for? Everyone's so excited! This is so exciting.
Travis: Why are you shouting? We have earrings.
Marisha: I was-- because we're on the high seas, and that's what sailors do.
Travis: Is it?
Marisha: Yeah! See, we're sailors, now!
Travis: We're sailors now.
Taliesin: She doesn't have to know what sailors actually do.
Matt: The shiphand who's manning the sail who's a foot from you right now just reaches up and covers his ear and goes, "Uh. We don't really yell that loud all the time into each other's ear, but thank you."
Travis: Yo-ho-ho! And a... help.
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Keyleth, ask the captain if she wants to have extra speed from your wind.
Marisha: Captain.
Taliesin: The captain, yes.
Marisha: I was-- I'm not talking to you, anymore, Percy. Captain.
Matt: As you approach from behind, she's currently holding the wheel, and she doesn't even turn her head to you, goes, "Yes?"
Marisha: Would you like more speed behind those sails?
Matt: "I mean, always, but--"
Marisha: Okay! And then I go back and I start doing Gusts into the sails.
Matt: Okay, Gust is a what-level spell?
Marisha: Well, it's a cantrip, or I could do a level three Gust of Wind.
Matt: Gust would be like a (pfft). It's more of a heavy fart.
Marisha: Sorry, level two Gust of Wind.
Laura: Basically you're blowing really hard.
Matt: A level three Gust of Wind, you said?
Marisha: Level two, level two. Gust of Wind.
Matt: Concentration for up to a minute, so okay. So as you focus-- actually, this is not a spell--
Laura: We're gonna be so fast for a minute.
Matt: Second-level spell, and it cannot be done at a higher level.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: However, it gives you a full minute of a very focused gust of wind of, as it-- the sails billow even further. You can see the ropes tighten, the guy with the rope around his arm goes, "Ow ow ow ow!" Has to unwind it real fast, go in and ratchet it to the side. But the sails pick up, and the ship itself picks up speed. For the next minute you've got a nice burst or so. You watch as the captain looks over the shoulder to you and gives you a nod, an approving nod, wordless, but--
Marisha: Captain.
Sam: I turn to Doty, and I say, take this down. With an efficiency and an effective leadership role model for everyone, the redhead continues to propel us forward, faster and faster, to everyone's surprise and respect, including the captain. As the salt licks my nose, and the sweet smell of adventure is in the air, I know that with her on our side, we will be strong and we will be protected. End of chapter.
Matt: The tension on the ship--
Marisha: Hey, look! I've got rubber booties! (laughs)
Sam: You're amazing.
Marisha: Aren't I cool, Tary?
Sam: Yes you are, ahoy!
Marisha: Ahoy!
Sam: (hearty laugh) Delightful!
Matt: The tension on the ship slowly recedes over the next hour as there is no sign of anything else.
Laura: Nothing?
Liam: Hey, man!
Travis: What?
Liam: You can't walk off in the middle of a game of hide-and-seek again. I've been in a barrel for an hour! I fell asleep in there!
Travis: I'm sorry, I get so distracted. Did someone find you?
Liam: No, I just woke up in a barrel, I don't even know what time it is--
Travis: Found you.
Liam: Touché, Grog.
Travis: Hey, do you want to help me? I think there's one of those wooden naked ladies on the front of the ship but I can't really see.
Liam: Uh.
Travis: Wanna reach a hand around and see if you get a handful of wooden boob?
Liam: Do you want me to do a reach-around, is that what you're asking me to do?
Travis: I might not ever ask you again, but right now, yes.
Liam: Okay, yeah, this is not like the wood nymph-- Never mind.
Travis: No, no, no.
Liam: I go ahead and do a reach-around, I suppose.
Matt: Okay. You shimmy out onto the front of the ship. You do actually see just the cusp of what looks like a pair of hands that are clasped, carved into the top of where the wooden point at the front of the ship is. So there is definitely a figure there.
Liam: Yeah, I'll hang down.
Matt: Okay. You hang down, and reach, as one would. (all laugh)
Taliesin: This got weird quick.
Matt: As you kinda grasp over and hold and feel around there--
Laura: This is so ridiculous.
Matt: -- not finding much in the breasts, but you find a bulge. It does indeed have a figure at the front of the ship, this one is not female.
Liam: Is it a wang?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Nice.
Matt: I mean it's a bulge where one would be, yeah.
Liam: Okay.
Marisha: This is an equal opportunity ship.
Laura: That's right.
Liam: Pat, pat, pat.
Travis: What you got down there?
Liam: Oh, she's a beaut, Grog, I wish you could see her. (all laugh)
Travis: Really? Describe her to me in vivid detail.
Liam: Oh, uh. Athletic, hearty. You know, curves in all the right places.
Travis: I'm loving this.
Liam: Yup, yup. Your type, I think.
Travis: Man, battle scars?
Liam: Uh.
Travis: How many breasts? Please say three.
Liam: It's one good, one good chest, here. You know what, I will draw you a picture. All right?
Travis: Yeah, that's great!
Liam: Okay. I'm gonna try to climb up without falling into the drink, all right?
Travis: Oh, yeah, that'd be good.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check real fast
Travis: (giggles)
Liam: Is this my character sheet? (all laugh)
Liam: That's a five.
Matt: That's a five? (laughs) You hear this brief bit of tension (sound of exertion). And then a (splash).
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: Vax? Vax? Yeah, okay, right, you fell off the ship. Right? Vax? Um?! (all laugh)
Sam: First player death.
Travis: I think Vax may have fallen overboard.
Marisha: Grog, what did you do?
Travis: I know it could be a very elaborate joke, but you know that sound when you deuce, and it goes  (ker-ploop)? (all laugh)
Travis: I just heard that and I think it was Vax.
Marisha: Ugh.
Laura: Can I look down in the water?
Matt: (laughs) Yeah, you look down, you don't see anybody in the water, but a moment passes and you glance over and there, up the side of the ship, with two daggers, climbing, and soaking, sopping wet with seawater, which has caused all of the heavy, thick black fabric to just become an additional 40 pounds on him, you watch Vax make his way up to the top of the ship once more.
Liam: This is the best this armor has smelled in weeks! (all laugh)
Liam: Ugh. I love the ocean!
Laura: I'm gonna land in the crow's nest with Percy.
Travis: That was amazing! You are so drenched right now.
Liam: I'm twice as heavy as normal.
Travis: Man. Yeah, no seriously, she's that stunning, huh, in the front?
Liam: I start--
Travis: I can't wait for the picture.
Liam: Oh yeah, yes, big.
Travis: Yeah.
Liam: Big.
Travis: Big booby. (all laugh)
Liam: That's you.
Travis: Big booby.
Marisha: I kinda do a quick, like, Druidcraft gust and dry him off a little bit.
Matt: Okay. It's like holding a hairdryer to him, just (loud whooshing). (all laugh)
Matt: His lips are like (pbbbft) off to the side briefly.
Liam: I shake like a husky a little bit.
Matt: Exactly.
Matt: All right, you said you head to the crow's nest with Percy?
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Anything in particular, just keeping watch?
Laura: Just keeping watch.
Taliesin: Sitting and sketching.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Looking out every now and then.
Laura: I don't feel as nauseous up here, it's nice.
Taliesin: Quite nice.
Matt: All right. About two hours later, I'll have you both roll perception checks, if you could.
Liam: This is the laziest day we've ever had.
Laura: I know, it's nice.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: Wow, no.
Matt: Days at sea, it's nice.
Sam: Meanwhile, Whitestone burns. (all laugh)
Matt: Shh.
Travis: Getting flashes.
Laura: No!
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: To be fair, I'm not really looking very much.
Matt: Fair enough.
Taliesin: 11.
Matt: Okay. 11. Yeah, you're distracted.
Travis: Oh, jeez.
Taliesin: I'm distracted.
Matt: With your companion.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay.
Taliesin: You're less distracted.
Laura: Uh, pretty distracted for Vex.
Travis: Is it clear skies or are we sailing through fog?
Matt: Uh, no, it is clear skies.
Travis: Right, so we could just look up, and see horror.
Taliesin: Wait, what?
Travis: What?
Laura: We're not having sex, we're just talking.
Travis: Oh!
Taliesin: Just having a chill. It's just to chill up there. It's nice.
Travis: Oh, right.
Liam: Just like a prom make-out, that's all.
Laura: No! Just chatting.
Taliesin: You're just sitting and drawing in a basket!
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: In a crow's nest? Like a big laundry basket? It's just like--
Taliesin: Yes, it's basically a hamper.
Laura: Yeah. TRAVIS Oh, okay.
Liam: It's the most privacy you've had--
Sam: Any hand action going on?
Taliesin: Oh my God!
Matt: (laughs) Jesus Christ!
Laura: No hand action, no hand action.
Taliesin: That got dark.
Matt: Anyway, you guys, due to distraction, catch it about the same time the rest of the party does. As you look ahead and notice that there is a fog bank forming maybe a few hundred feet ahead of the ship.
Travis: Called it.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Marisha: Who sees it?
Matt: Well, everybody does now.
Marisha: Oh, everybody does now. Can I do a nature check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog?
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: That's not great. 14.
Matt: 14. It doesn't take much for you to realize that this fog is pretty localized. It's not an entire bank that covers the entirety of the ocean in actuance. You kind of travel from one side of the boat to the other to get the scope of it. It's pretty narrow and pretty focused in its direction.
Marisha: Does this look like something that I would have? Like, is this another druid doing a fog cloud spell?
Matt: You recognize this to be of similar size although magnified.
Marisha: Bigger than us?
Matt: A little--
Marisha: Than my spell. Bigger than my spell?
Matt: Bigger than the usual spell that you are used to casting but it does appear localized enough to be of a similar-type spell or effect.
Travis: Hey, Keyleth?
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Quick question. Is there a d-- decor-- uh, like a proper way to announce ourselves?
Sam: Protocol.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: Well, I--
Matt: The ship suddenly lists a bit as you watch as Adella is now turning the wheel and turning the ship to try and veer around the fog bank that suddenly has appeared, and she's shouting off to some of her crew. They're starting to man the ballista at the back of the ship once more--
Laura: Is this normal? Is this a sea monster?
Matt: "Um. It's fog!"
Travis: (laughs)
Matt: "I have not yet encountered a monster that creates fog! But I'd rather not be caught off guard."
Marisha: Wait, wait, wait, this--
Sam: I can communicate with semaphore if that's something you'd like me to do?
Travis: What's semaphore?
Sam: It's communication with flags. It's a primitive communication technique that I learned in many of my studies, boat-to-boat it's really helpful. I pull out a couple of pieces of fabric and start gesturing--
Travis: Holy shit. You're that guy. (all laugh)
Travis: Where is the other boat?
Sam: Well, you just said to announce ourselves, I could announce. Vox--
Laura: I wonder if they can see through the fog?
Sam: -- Ma--
Travis: Yeah, we should have him do that. You should go to the front of the ship--
Sam: -- chi--
Travis: -- and just make sure they know we're coming.
Marisha: Can you do any flourishes?
Sam: -- na.
Marisha: Can you do any like tosses? Like color guard?
Sam: Oh, no, no.
Marisha: Oh, damn. All right.
Sam: That would be really cool, though.
Marisha: Sorry, Captain? How close are we to our destination? This could be Vesrah.
Matt: "From the recent calculations I made on our map, we're at least a day and a half out."
Marisha: Really? Does this look to be island-sized?
Matt: She's glancing over the front and-- you guys, by the way, are up there in the crow's nest and one of the ship hands is now climbing up the rope net to get to the top as part of his job--
Laura: It's a little crowded up here, but--
Matt: -- he gets up there and goes, "Um."
Laura: I hop on the broom and get out of it so he has more room.
Taliesin: I'm used to this enough, I know how to make room from last time I was on a boat.
Matt: He hops in and pulls out his spy glass and begins looking out. Shouts down to the captain. "Captain! It's moving!"
Laura: It's moving!
Taliesin: It's moving?
Matt: And you watch as she shifts-- the ship begins to turn wide to move around and the fog shifts to meet the direction of the ship.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Travis: Smart fog.
Laura: I just pull out an arrow and get ready.
Marisha: So it's coming towards us?
Matt: Mm-hm, or the ship is going towards it.
Laura: I'm going to tie off a rope to the broom.
Taliesin: Not a bad idea.
Matt: All right. She continues to try and move around, and the fog cloud shifts around, shakes her head and you hear as Adella shouts out, "All right, looks like we're going in. Be at the ready!" And eventually the fog bank hits the front of the ship, and within moments your visibility is cut to nothing.
Travis: What?
Matt: You can see no more than maybe a few feet past the edge of the boat, and for those at the back of the ship, the front of the ship is obscured. Those at the front of the ship, the back of the ship is obscured. It is a very, very thick fog that has completely immersed the outside of the ship.
Travis: Vax, don't try anything.
Taliesin: Everybody keep checking in.
Sam: I will flip a coin to Jumbo over there and tell him, listen, if things get hairy you might want to use this.
Travis: Use what? I can't see you.
Sam: Oh, God! Shit! (all laugh)
Marisha: I do another Gust of Wind and clear the ship deck and clear the path ahead of us.
Matt: Okay. They clear out, and slowly the fog begins to choke back inwards. Slowly, it does help temporarily, but as the ship moves forward basically you move past the area that you've cleared out a little bit, and the rest of the fog tends to envelop it.
Marisha: I'm going to see if I can see what this is from underneath the water. I'll be back. And I swan-dive off of the edge and into the water.
Laura: Did you say it over the earring?
Marisha: Yeah, bye. I'll be back. Bye! I'm going to do Alter Self to give myself little gills and little fin hands and go with the ship.
Sam: As I see her do this, I am going to alter myself to have the same.
Marisha: Oh! What's up, Tary?
Sam: I pick up the coin and hand it to Grog and say, this will make you fly. And I'll dive over the edge as well.
Matt: Okay, Tary gives a graceful, if a little clunkier, dive. In full armor, which makes it hard to swim.
Sam: Oh, shit. (all laugh)
Matt: But you can breathe underwater. It's medium armor, it's not too crazy, you're fine. But you with a much heavier splash. You look behind you, and see Taryon has met you in the water with the gills also kind of extending out of the sides of his neck. I would like both of you to make perception checks. (all laugh)
Matt: Make perception checks, please.
Marisha: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Sam: 16.
Marisha: It was cocked. It was right on a 20, which sucks. That's all right, perception check, 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, as you guys hit the water and go underneath for a second, you can see amongst the water, which is relatively still out here, and there's still the fog above, you see a slight displacement in the water.
Sam: Oh, there's something in the water, a boat.
Matt: Keyleth, you look over and you can see the displacement. There is nothing dark, but it's almost like something is pushing down into the water, or like there is a concave portion of the water.
Marisha: But nothing under the surface? Nothing breaking the surface tension of the water?
Matt: It is breaking the surface tension, like it's in-- as you glance over you can see there's what appears to be an unnatural break in the waves like a path.
Laura: Like it's invisible?
Matt: It's like another ship or something of that size is currently keeping in time with the Drensala Vis.
Taliesin: Oh.
Marisha: It looks smooth. It looks man-made?
Matt: Well, you don't see what's there. All you see is the break in the water.
Marisha: It's invisible. Okay, I come up out of the water and I use my earring to communicate that to everyone else.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Do you still have your fucking gills on?
Marisha: It's, you know-- I don't know, do I?
Laura: Does that mean you choke?
Travis: Yeah are you like--
Marisha: Can I communicate?
Sam: She has gills but she keeps her mouth and stuff right?
Marisha: I can still talk.
Matt: You can still speak, I'd say, once you break the surface of the water.
Marisha: Yeah I come out of the water and communicate it.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You sound like Kim Carnes. Everybody, this is great. (all laugh)
Marisha: A little bit like Linda Blair.
Matt: All right, you guys hear Keyleth begin to inform you as you hear off to the left side of the ship two localized sounds-- it sounds like wood slamming into wood or some sort of a heavy impact, two in rapid succession. And you watch as from out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks slam into the ship with chains behind them that suddenly grow taut. The rest of the crew begins to turn around and move their ballistas in the direction of where the chains come from, but you still see nothing there. The fog is too thick.
Liam: I'm going to hide.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.
Travis: And we can see the hooks, right?
Matt: You can see the hooks, yes.
Laura: Can we see the hooks from the crow's nest?
Matt: It's just out of view. You watch them pass through, and you see them arc below you, and then vanish into the fog. And you hear the impact and the ship kind of (impact noise) from the hit.
Laura: I want to try and hover down so I can see a little better.
Taliesin: Are you with me?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going to very quietly say that I'm going to grab onto your broom and head towards that end. I'm also going to activate the spider climbing boots.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I would definitely like to go and see the giant sea creature claw that just grabbed onto the boat.
Matt: Okay, you rush up to the edge of this giant claw that's hit it and you can see it's a thick-- like a dark iron pole maybe about that long--
Travis: Oh!
Matt: -- it's about that big around and has a large chain affixed to it that just progresses off that side of the boat into the fog. It looks like a series of giant hooks or curved spikes, and it has jammed and dug itself and dragged and caught on to the actual deck of the ship.
Travis: Good news, not a sea monster. Bad news, a big hook that leads to nowhere.
Laura: Get it off the ship. Can you pull it off?
Travis: Sure. So I'll try and lift the hook off the ship.
Matt: Go ahead and make a strength check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15. You're lifting right now and it's not shifting. Unfortunately, the weight of both the ship moving forward, the tension on the chain and the hook, and the hook being so heavily dug into the deck, like versus that portion you're just not getting enough of a lift. There's too much torsion on the actual connection to the ship.
Travis: You know what, I want to see where this leads. I'm going to leave it here.
Liam: Fuck you, physics.
Marisha: I'm going to swim closer to where the chains are coming from and swim closer to the invisi-ship.
Sam: I join her.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Trinket's going to run up next to Grog.
Matt: Okay, so Trinket and Grog are now heading to the left side of the ship--
Travis: Hey, buddy.
Matt: --you guys are swimming in the water towards that direction, and you watch as suddenly what was once a slight displacement in the water becomes visible. And you see before you a smaller, more compact-looking ship, but it has a series of iron plates all across it in various places. It's armored from all directions, haphazardly. Not a beautiful construction per se, but made for function.
Marisha: I'm going to come up-- oh, go ahead.
Matt: You look up, and from what you can see on the edge of the ship, and you can see what appear to be two small gray crystals that are giving a faint glow, and it looks like they are actually creating and emanating this fog that is surrounding the space.
Travis: Awesome.
Taliesin: Fog machine.
Marisha: I'm going to come up and, in the path as the ship is going by, can I do a poof of Faerie Fire in front of it? To see if I can Faerie Fire the ship?
Matt: Okay, well, you can only Faerie Fire creatures in a small area, a ship--
Marisha: It's not going to do it.
Matt: --probably shouldn't be Faerie Fire.
Marisha: Okay, then I'm going to see if I can-- can I try and grab onto the side of the ship?
Matt: With just your fingers? It's pretty-- I mean-- okay, you know what, I will say because of the iron plating there is a little bit of a grip.
Marisha: The seams?
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: With your webbed fingers.
Sam: Can I join her on this?
Matt: Mm-hm. You can, indeed.
Marisha: Natural one.
Matt: You reach up and grab, and about three nails snap, and you lose your grip, falling back into the water.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: Oh, ow.
Laura: That's just mean.
Marisha: That shit hurts.
Sam: Athletics?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ten.
Matt: You barely hold on. You don't climb, but you hold on and watch as Keyleth just--
Sam: Oh! I'm alone. (all laugh)
Sam: Do I see her in the water?
Matt: You see her splash and disappear under the water below. The fog is starting to close around the area.
Sam: Shit. She can swim; she'll be okay. She's so strong and powerful.
Marisha: Do I see Tary?
Matt: You just went under the water. You come back up and you watch Tary vanish as you're now being left behind. The ships are traveling faster.
Laura: Keyleth, can you do anything about this fog?
Marisha: Yes! Once I track down the ship. I kind of swim up and I say, Tary can you catch-- this might be bad. Do I see any type of-- what are they called? Cleats. The ship cleats. Do I see anything like ship cleats? Right?
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's right, it's the little prongs.
Marisha: Like the little things, the prongs. Do I see anything like that? I want to try and do a-- like a grasp-- like Thorn Whip myself to the ship.
Matt: You see one, it's a little ways up from where the ship is actually hitting the water. You would have to probably swim close enough to get there. I'm going to say, make an athletics check to see how quickly you can try and swim against the ocean just for this brief moment. You're going to have to roll pretty high.
Marisha: Well, that's not great. Just straight athletics?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Athletics is pretty good! 15!
Matt: 15?
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: I'll say you don't fall too far behind the ship, it's still going faster than you and the water is kind of up and down. Using your Alter Self gills, you can dive below the surface to try and avoid the choppiness of the ocean, and you come back up. What's the range on your Thorn Whip?
Marisha: 30-foot range.
Matt: 30-foot range, and it pulls whatever is there ten feet towards you. We can say it'll pull you ten feet towards it. So it gives you a slight arc, but not enough to actually reach the ship, you can just cruise past the grasping range of Taryon. So, Taryon, as you're there on the side and you glance over and you watch as Keyleth suddenly produces a large thorny whip, a druidic vine that wraps around the small cleat on the side of the ship.
Sam: Oh, shit.
Matt: And you watch as she arcs out of the fog towards you, reaching her hand out in your direction.
Sam: I will--
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes!
Marisha: Tary!
Sam: Yes, grab my hero's hand. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay. You grab her hand--
Marisha: Tary! I want to apologize right now. Because in this moment, I am a damsel and I am in distress! (all laugh)
Marisha: So cross it off, bitch. Come on!
Matt: Make a strength check.
Sam: Okay. Okay.
Taliesin: Oh, please. Oh, please.
Sam: Wait, strength?
Matt: Yes, just a strength modifier bonus.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky! Yeah. (all laugh)
Sam: 19.
Liam: Hey!
Matt: Okay. All right. You grab her, and you-- it pulls you from two points, but you had managed to keep your hold and grasp Keyleth, now dangling from your arm.
Sam: I did a lot of pushups today! Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Matt: It is. You're very sore-- (all laugh)
Matt: You are very sore, but you manage to get her right up to the edge of the ship, and she manages to get a grip onto the edge.
Sam: I. Was amazing. (all laugh)
Marisha: You were. Today, in this moment, for this 30 seconds of time--
Sam: Augh! (all laugh)
Taliesin: I'm gonna be in the middle of this for months.
Marisha: --you were a hero.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be right in the middle of this. For months. Okay.
Sam: We'll omit that part. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Did it leave a little stain?
Sam: It's in my nose.
Marisha: Thanks. Okay.
Matt: You look up at this point and you can just barely see the chain, and you watch as a couple shapes, just barely visible through the fog, are now leaping across the chain towards your ship. So--
Marisha: I give a heads up. Heads up, heads up, people. Incoming forces, coming your way!
Matt: You guys in the ship, you glance over where the chains are currently pulling taut. You watch as a series of humanoid figures wearing dark, dark green and black leathers, their faces partially obscured, rush onto the ship, weapons drawn. I'm gonna ask everyone to roll initiative.
Marisha: Fuck. I hope these aren't my--
Travis: Right. You ran into our ship!
Marisha: --these aren't, like, my people, right? I haven't found out who they are.
Laura: I know! What if they are?
Travis: We gonna kill 'em.
Marisha: No!
Taliesin: Whoa! I don't feel good about that.
Laura: Look at that!
Marisha: Yay, it's a boat!
Travis: Boats!
Sam: There's a boat! Oh, wow, the top-down view looks so three-dimensional right now.
Laura: Yeah, really, it does.
Sam: It's really cool.
Laura: This is insane! This looks so 3D!
Travis: Well done, man!
Sam: 1980s graphics!
Matt: I can't take full credit for these. These were already premade
Travis: Aw.
Taliesin: This is like the finest arcade that I've ever been by.
Laura: This is so cool.
Travis: Which one's us?
Matt: All right. There's the two of them in the ocean currently off to the side.
Travis: You dingalings.
Laura: They can fly. They can fly. Oh my goodness gracious. This is so cool. What is this? What is that?
Matt: All right, so. Up in the crow's nest, we have Percy, one of the other shipmates, kinda up there. We have, down here at the wheel, the captain. These two, wielding two different ballistas.
Travis: At the bow of the ship, heading for --
Laura: -- a new land!
Matt: We have Doty, just hanging off to the side, watching and trying to take record of whatever's happening at the moment. Grog, where are you?
Travis: Wherever that grappling hook was.
Matt: That would be right here.
Sam: (roars)
Matt: With Trinket right by your side.
Travis: Welcoming committee.
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: We're gonna eat it.
Laura: Me and Percy had said we were sort of on our way down.
Taliesin: Or actually, we had sort of headed towards the other boat.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Right, so you guys had made your way. So, yeah. So--
Taliesin: I was gonna ask you to drop me at the other crow's nest on the other ship.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: You need more iron in my diet.
Marisha: These are probably the Water Ashari, aren't they?
Matt: So you guys are heading this way? Are you taking him with you?
Taliesin: If you're down.
Laura: Uh, I was going to. I wasn't going to go all the way to the other boat, but I can. If you want to go with us.
Taliesin: Oh, please!
Sam: Toy boat, toy boat.
Sam: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Taliesin: Toy boat.
Laura: Toy boat.
Sam: Tor Books.
Sam: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Tor Books, Tor Books, Tor Books. It's actually kinda hard.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: All right. Vax, where are you? Since you are hiding.
Liam: Well, I did a stealth check, and I got a 25--
Matt: Right.
Liam: I didn't know what the boat looked like, so if there's stuff in the bottom, I'd hide there, but if they're gone, I could also have gone up to the crow's nest. Whichever.
Matt: You could probably be hiding amongst one of the low sails probably. So we'll say you're up in this sail.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: In that vicinity. All righty. So. Bringing us now to the initiative order.
Taliesin: Oh, boy.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Liam: Shit.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Yikes.
Liam: (knocks on table)
Matt: 20 to 15?
Taliesin: 15.
Laura: 18.
Liam: 18.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Eee.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Twins.
Liam: Wapetopetok!
Laura: (explosion sounds)
Liam: (explosion sounds)
Travis: You both had 18?
Laura: Yeah!
Travis: Nice.
Matt: 15 to ten?
Travis: 14.
Matt: Grog. All right.
Marisha: Oh. 11. Sorry.
Matt: That's all right. Keyleth. And then?
Sam: Eight.
Matt: Tary.
Laura: Hey, look, some things don't change. (all laugh)
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Burn!
Sam: Stings.
Matt: All righty. So. You watch as these figures just jump across from the chains that are lashed onto the boat, and as two of them make it across, suddenly, up the side of the ship, you watch as if a singular wave seems to (water rushing) and splash onto the edge of the ship. However, as the water crests and splashes into the ground, it forms up into its own physical entity.
Sam: Ooh.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Oh shit. Water elementals.
Matt: You've seen this form once before, that Keyleth has taken--
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: --this is a water elemental.
Laura: What if this is the Ashari?
Marisha: It probably is. Just haven't figured that out yet.
Matt: (laughs) Where did I last put it? All righty, so. That being the case, I'm gonna go ahead and pull these up there.
Laura: Did we say we did anything about the fog? The fog is still there.
Matt: The fog is still in this vicinity right now. So, you're under the effect of a Fog Cloud spell... for the area. So, basically, the area around is heavily obscured. So that will increase uh, AC to a number of individuals. Perfect. All right, so. So first off, this elemental rushes forward to Grog, splashes around in your direction. Grog, it's gonna go ahead and take a series of swings at you.
Travis: Sweet.
Matt: Yeah, it's gonna take two slam attacks. That is a 23 to hit?
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And an 18 to hit.
Travis: Hits also.
Matt: All righty. So you suffer 12 points of bludgeoning damage. That's full damage. You're not raging.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: And that is 15. 15 points of bludgeoning damage.
Travis: Total? Or 12 and 15 both?
Matt: 12 and 15.
Travis: Gotcha.
Matt: All right, that ends that guy's turn. Next up is Vax and Vex.
Laura: I was on my way over to the other--
Taliesin: Drop off.
Laura: -- towards the other ship.
Travis: Bludgeoning.
Taliesin: As long as you roll by, I'll just let go.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: You can drop me off.
Laura: Percy wants to be dropped off at the crow's nest, so I'll fly over that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Keeping an eye out for anything visible that I can shoot at.
Taliesin: The minute I see a rope, I'll just let go and drop. So she can just keep moving.
Matt: Okay. So we'll say--
Laura: Flyby.
Matt: As you guys make it onto the other side of the ship--
Taliesin: You know, you could've spent your time making two very complex Lego pirate ships. All week.
Matt: You're right.
Taliesin: I'm just saying.
Matt: But I don't have that time, unfortunately. (all laugh)
Matt: Right, so you guys, right over to this ship here?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: You drop him in the crow's nest.
Laura: Uh-huh.
Matt: All right. And you are currently on your bow? Is that all you're gonna do?
Laura: I'm on-- yeah, I'm on my broom. I'm just riding my bow around.
Matt: Fair enough.
Laura: Can I drift down to where I can see anything and I say to Keyleth, Uh, fog? Can you do anything about the fog?
Matt: On their ship?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. So as you coast down a little lower, I want you to make a perception check.
Laura: I like that one. 31.
Travis: Jesus.
Matt: 31. You glance down, and as the fog parts, you see on this ship, there are three other similarly dressed, dark green and black leather humanoids that are now beginning to rush over the chain, and standing back, on the back of the ship, arms crossed, you see a large humanoid with a fish-like head. It has no nose, a big fish-like mouth, big bulbous throat, kind of a greenish-blue skin color, very turquoise, with big fin gills at the side and a large crest that goes down the head. But it's wearing fine billowing silks, and a large vest, and its lower torso, from this giant oversized kind of plump belly, the lower torso is just this swirl of water that sits there, and it looks like it's currently concentrating through the fog on the opposite side.
Laura: Oh, jebus.
Matt: It does not seem to notice you at the moment.
Laura: Then, I'm gonna try to Bramble Shot that motherfucker.
Matt: It is right there.
Marisha: Well, that's pretty cool.
Laura: I'm gonna try to shoot a Bramble Shot at him.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Okay. 20?
Matt: 20? Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: Yes. Okay. Oh, Hunter's Mark. Motherfuck! That's okay, sneak attack.
Travis: It's all right, you've never played this game before.
Laura: Why? I can't help it, I get so happy. Okay.
Matt: Let's see. Actually, roll again. Because in the fog cloud you do have disadvantage on strikes.
Travis: Oh, that's cruel, man.
Laura: That's cruel.
Travis: (laughs painfully) Don't do it.
Matt: One?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Oh. That sucks.
Laura: That's okay. That's okay, I'm gonna try to do another shot. And in that downtime, I'm gonna fucking Hunter's Mark.
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: There you go.
Sam: Turn them lemons--
Travis: Into orange juice. (all laugh)
Matt: So this entity is currently Hunter's Marked, and you can take your second attack, if you like.
Laura: Okay. I can't do a Bramble Shot again 'cause that was wasted? Or does that mean-- Does a Bramble Shot only work if it connects?
Matt: I'm gonna say for the purpose of this Bramble Shot, 'cause it's only fair and it's a powerful vestige, it only works if it connects. That should change the wording on that.
Laura: Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 does hit.
Laura: Yes! Okay. 15 plus four lightning damage.
Matt: Slick.
Laura: Plus Sneak Attack. Woo, an 11 for the Sneak Attack and Hunter's Mark. And then the DC of 17 or be restrained. That's strength save.
Matt: Gotcha.
Laura: And I'm gonna do the Bramble Shot damage now.
Matt: That is a 13.
Laura: Hoo, yes! He's restrained.
Matt: Go for it, roll the damage. For Bramble Shot.
Laura: Ooh. Is that a sev-- that's a one. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and make a concentration check on him. He succeeds. With a 26. All right, so, the first shot whips past and just slams into the ship. You watch as this giant fish entity kinda glances off to the side, looks down and starts looking up into the fog cloud, but you're right above it at this point, or just off to the side, and you fire your second arrow, it turns just in time to see it hit it in the shoulder, as it glances up, tries to snap it free. The wooden shaft of the arrow suddenly sprouts all these vines and thorns that begin to wrap around it and it tears in its body, and it's currently stuck in place. It cannot move.
Laura: Awesome. And I say, Percy, spellcaster, right below you. Fish guy.
Taliesin: (exhales) Got it. Not sure what to do.
Sam: Noted.
Matt: All right. So, ending that, we come to Vax's turn.
Liam: One of the assailants is directly across from me, on the other side of our boat, right?
Matt: There is one crossing right now.
Liam: But there is one guy who made it onto the boat?
Matt: There's two of them who made onto the boat, right there.
Liam: Right there? I'm gonna attempt to Assassinate that motherfucker.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, god!
Matt: So you're-- we'll say you're up over, you kind of shimmy your way along the edge of the sail, and you're looking right down below him.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: This guy right there.
Liam: So, advantage on this.
Matt: The guy closest to Grog, or the guy who's alone right there?
Liam: The one that you are touching right now.
Matt: Okay, gotcha.
Liam: Yeah. So that is a 32 to hit.
Matt: That will hit.
Liam: So this is Assassinate, it's an auto-crit--
Matt: Did you roll at disadvantage because of the fog cloud?
Liam: Well, no, but I'm at advantage because of Assassinate, so the first roll was a 19.
Matt: Yeah, so you're fine.
Liam: Which is still a 32. Here we go.
Laura: I get 2d6 now for Sneak Attack.
Matt: You do. So roll another d6.
Laura: Another six!
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: Hey, that die!
Matt: That's 48 points of damage in one hit.
Laura: Bramble Shot, motherfucker!
Liam: Doing my maths over here. 32, 36, 72. That's 80 points of damage.
Matt: 80 points of damage.
Travis: What the fuck? No wonder Tary almost died.
Liam: Is he still standing?
Matt: No. (all laugh)
Travis: Assassinate!
Matt: Just leaps off the chain and pulls out what looks like-- for this, it would be a dagger and a rapier. Glances around and goes lunging in for the captain of the ship. Gets maybe two steps, before your blade sinks into the back of the neck. And he just hits the side, and collapses, right at the edge of the ship right there. Done.
Liam: Okay, just for funsies I will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of Trink.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: So, that is not that good.
Laura: Ooh.
Liam: That's a 13.
Matt: Okay, yeah. Even with disadvantage. Okay. So this one you fire, and just disappears off to the side of the ship, but returns to your belt. Are you gonna stay where you are?
Liam: No, I'm gonna drop down.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And circle around Trinket's tush.
Matt: All right. Make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure.
Matt: Just to land from the top there.
Liam: Yeah, 25.
Matt: Yeah, you're fine. So you move around behind Trinket. All righty.  That ends your turn, Vax. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna take a quick look around to see if I can figure out what's causing this fog because it's annoying me.
Matt: Perception check.
Taliesin: That's a 19.
Matt: Glancing about in the area, it's hard to see, especially from this vantage point. The area is so heavily obscured with fog. You do glance and see what looks to be a very, very faint general glow in a lower area towards the edge of the ship. But that's all you can make out.
Taliesin: Starboard? Port?
Matt: It'd be on this side.
Taliesin: All right. Somebody take a look at anything. There's a glow coming from the starboard side of the enemy ship. It's the one closest to our ship. We need to find out what's causing this fog. In the meantime, I'm gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the ropes. Is that an enemy right there? That guy?
Matt: You're up here.
Taliesin: Yeah, I know. I'm asking if that's an enemy on our ship, right there.
Matt: This is an enemy right there.
Marisha: The water elemental.
Matt: These are enemies. These are your guys, the guys with the red cloaks; the red color signifies your own crewmates.
Taliesin: Okay, so we have two enemies that are currently on their ship.
Matt: Two enemies in their ship, one that's currently crossing, and one that is on the other side.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm gonna slowly start making my way, just maybe a few feet down, and I'm going to shoot those two people who are on the very edge. Both of them in the back.
Sam: There's no honor in that.
Taliesin: No. There is, on the other hand, fine comedy about to happen.
Sam: True, true.
Taliesin: I'm gonna very, very carefully. And I'm at disadvantage with this?
Matt: Disadvantage with each strike, yes.
Taliesin: Oh, that's annoying. Okay, I'm gonna use the pepperbox, the Animus, and I'm also going to burn a Grit for a push.
Matt: For which one of these guys?
Taliesin: What about one on each?
Matt: One of these two?
Taliesin: Both of them. I'll start with the first one, and work my way down.
Matt: Okay. First one there.
Taliesin: All right, so, let's see what happens.
Marisha: Big money, no whammies!
Taliesin: That will do. That's a 28?
Matt: 28 will hit.
Taliesin: And that's-- I'm sorry, you know why I'm a little confused, I just had to switch, again. That's, wow--
Marisha: That's good.
Taliesin: -- that's good. That's 17 points of damage and five points of psychic damage.
Matt: Nice!
Taliesin: And he goes ten feet away from me.
Travis: Ah.
Laura: Oh!
Marisha: (yelps)
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: As he's trying to step across the chain--
Liam: Wilhelm scream.
Matt: (gunshot)
Marisha: (Wilhelm screams)
Matt: He gets blasted. And (Wilhelm scream) just plunges off the side of the chain, loses his footing, tumbles over, and vanishes into the fog. And you hear this splash, a moment later.
Taliesin: Next! I love boats.
Matt: So this guy? Disadvantage on this shot.
Taliesin: Yep. Here we go. That's, oh that's good, 29. I'm rolling really well.
Matt: Yeah, that will hit.
Taliesin: Not as well as yesterday, but really well.
Marisha: (singing) I got a nautical themed, pashmina Afghan.
Taliesin: And that's five, six  that's 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage, and a ten-foot push.
Matt: All righty. Okay. He also (snapping sound) falls off, grabs the chain, catches it with his finger, but because of the sea spray and the fog, it's too slick and (slipping sound, Wilhelm scream) just falls.
Taliesin: I was just gonna say, he's happy to grab, and I'll deal with that too.
Matt: Yeah. But they both have fallen off the ship.
Marisha: That's what she said? No.
Taliesin: I can make him drop things. I have that power.
Marisha: Oh. My god. Drop the chain they're holding on to?
Taliesin: I've been wanting to watch somebody holding on and make them drop it. I've been wanting to do that for like, probably a year and a half now. God, is there anybody fun on our side?
Laura: The fish guy.
Taliesin: You've got him grappled.
Matt: You've one guy walking across, right now, on the chain, and the guy below you who is grappled, and the water elemental that's also attacking you.
Travis: Yeah, don't you get advantage on grappled guy?
Taliesin: Technically I would. That would cancel out, wouldn't it?
Matt: He is restrained, which means attacks on him are with advantage, so it would cancel it out.
Taliesin: It would cancel it out automatically. Oh. In that case, I'm gonna take a shot on him.
Laura: And it'll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as it's his turn.
Taliesin: Okay, good point. So, I'm gonna take a Sharpshooter shot. I'm also going to-- is he holding anything?
Matt: Not that you can see.
Taliesin: That's good. And he's a magic? Yeah, that will do. I'll just take a good old-fashioned Sharpshooter shot. So that's-- that's not as good. That's 18 to hit?
Matt: 18 to hit? Just barely hits.
Taliesin: Oh, thank god. Okay.
Liam: I hope these aren't your cousins.
Marisha: They might be.
Taliesin: Well. They were a little--
Travis: Nobody's tried talking yet?
Marisha: We'll figure that out.
Laura: We're kind of being ambushed. So...
Taliesin: That's kind of heavy. That's gonna be 24 points of damage, and three points of psychic damage.
Laura: I don't think your cousins are fish people.
Marisha: My cousins might be fish men.
Liam: They could be werefish or...
Marisha: They could be anybody. They could be werefish.
Matt: Gotcha. Okay, so you managed to fire (gunshot) the third shot out from Animus. You see it blasts into the upper shoulder and back portion of this fish-like creature. (growls) It does not look terribly happy. But it is currently still bound by the various thorny vines that have wrapped around it. End your turn?
Taliesin: Yeah, and I'm just gonna crawl a couple feet into the ropes in that direction.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm just gonna keep rope-swinging. There we are.
Matt: There you go. All righty, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: After getting hit by the water elemental, can I go, Hey! What do you want?
Matt: The water elemental just (gurgling growls).
Travis: Fuck it. You got saltwater in my eyes; I would like to rage!
Matt: Okay.
Travis: I go into a rage.
Marisha: It's not me, Grog. It's not me.
Travis: Oh, I hadn't thought about that. (all laugh)
Travis: And I beat the shit out of it with the dwarven hammer. Two hits.
Matt: Go for it. Two strikes.
Travis: Are these at disadvantage? Or I'm right up there?
Matt: No, you're melee, you're fine.
Travis: Hey! Reckless attack.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh, my.
Liam: Hells yeah.
Travis: 23.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Nice. 17.
Matt: 17 damage. Okay. Now your last strike?
Travis: God, those are balls! They're not literal balls. 22.
Matt: That hits.
Laura: Nice!
Travis: 24. 24 points of damage.
Matt: 24 points of damage? Okay, nice. So you start bludgeoning its watery form. Even though you see the water splashing around, and it's soaking everything in the vicinity, you are still watching as each blow forces the creature to kinda shift and move, and you hear this (gurgling sound) kind of dull thud sound, and a pained noise seems to emit from this elemental creature with each impact.
Travis: You can do better than that.
Matt: Does that end your turn?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All righty. That brings us to the rest of the crew. So these guys-- the water has now pushed them past a bit. They are moved and they're starting to try and swim their way to the edge of the ship, and they're starting to actually-- Let's see what their rolls are for their athletics. Natural 20, nice. Okay, so they both make their way up to the side of this side of the ship and latch onto the edge, right beside Keyleth and Taryon.
Sam: Oh, great.
Marisha: Can I say something to him?
Matt: Yeah, as both (grunts) get out of the water, they're pulling up right alongside you, pulling blades out.
Marisha: Hi! Kaitiyaki. Water Ashari?
Matt: You hear them just growl as they pull their blades out, and continue.
Marisha: Hm. Hm.
Liam: Kick his ass.
Travis: Yeah, we tried to talk.
Matt: So for this one, each of them are gonna make two strikes against each of you with their rapiers.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: Taryon, that is a 21?
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: And a 21.
Sam: Yeah.
Matt: I rolled the same number twice in a row. So you take--
Travis: What's your AC there, big guy?
Sam: 15.
Matt: Nine points of piercing damage and five points of piercing damage.
Sam: Sure.
Matt: As it just thrust--
Sam: Ow!
Matt: -- holding onto the side of the ship's armor, thrusting the rapier into you, scraping past your armor. One catches you in the hip.
Sam: Ugh.
Travis: Ooh.
Matt: Keyleth, the other one's gonna make two strikes against you. That's gonna be--
Marisha: Cousins?
Matt: An eight?
Marisha: No? Oh. Nope, that misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: And that's gonna hit you for ten points of piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay. That's-- yeah.
Matt: And it looks like their ascent has stopped and they're just right now happy to just continue to pierce these two stowaways that are gripping onto the side of the ship. This one stumbles across the rest of the chain. And turning and seeing you guys there on the edge, Vax as you dart around the side of Trinket, it's gonna move, avoid the bear, step across, and attempt to attack you twice with the rapier, once with the dagger.
Liam: Sure.
Marisha: Jeez Louise.
Matt: So the dagger's gonna be 11?
Liam: No.
Matt: Not very good.
Liam: That's a no.
Matt: However, that is a 26.
Liam: That hits. Uncanny Dodge.
Matt: And a 19.
Liam: No.
Matt: No. All right, so, they get one rapier strike towards you. That is going to be nine points of piercing damage.
Liam: Halved.
Matt: As it just cuts across the center of your armor in the midsection. It doesn't actually get the skin, but it's enough of an impact where you can feel a bruise coming.
Liam: Tight.
Matt: All righty. Ending their turn, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: Okay. Am I still on the side of the boat?
Matt: You are, yes.
Marisha: I'm gonna climb up that boat.
Matt: Okay, make an athletics check.
Marisha: Ooh, that's good, 17 plus my athletics, which is good, which is seven, so 24.
Matt: Okay, so you get up on the edge of the ship, it does get one attack of opportunity against you as you move up. It's gonna slice at you with a rapier. That is gonna be an 18.
Marisha: Miss.
Sam: Whoa.
Matt: Nice.
Marisha: No. Hit. Sorry.
Matt: Okay, there you go, that's all good. That is ten points piercing damage.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: As the rapier just catches you in the back, and you're like (groans), and you climb up and get back onto the edge of the ship. As you glance around, you can see that there is the weird fish-looking guy in the center of the ship right now. It's currently bound by the vines around him.
Marisha: Any sign that these could still be my people? Pretty certain they're not.
Travis: I think you can let that go now.
Matt: You're pretty sure there's not much of a tribal sign--
Marisha: Nothing?
Matt: -- that resembles anything Ashari-related universally.
Marisha: Guys, real pirates! And then I'm going to do Control Water. And I'm going to raise water 20 feet around me, and start sinking this bitch. I want to sink this ship. 20 feet, just tidal waves coming over the boat, and I'm sinking it.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: Control Water, what level is this?
Marisha: Fourth level.
Laura: We could steal this ship. Okay.
Taliesin: It might have stuff.
Marisha: Nope. I'm sinking it.
Matt: Okay, as you get on the edge you begin to pull your arms up, and as you do, you hands begin to glow with a dull blue-turquoise color, similar to the skin of this fish-like creature, and it glances over at you, and its jaw opens. You can see this burbling sound as the edges of the water begin to rise up and splash and pour into the ship, perpetually filling the lower, usually air-filled section of this ship. And it begins to immediately (thud) list a little bit to one side.
Marisha: Do I have any movement, or is that it? Probably getting up is my movement.
Matt: That's gonna be your action, and climbing up is gonna be your movement. So that's kinda where you are.
Marisha: Okay. Cool.
Matt: You can maintain concentration on it.
Taliesin: We're gonna want to break the chains.
Marisha: I maintain concentration.
Matt: You get the sense, it's gonna take a few rounds, but if you keep at this, you'll probably have a  good chance of achieving your goal.
Marisha: Cool. It's what I like to hear in life, in general.
Laura: You might bring our ship down with it, Keyleth.
Travis: If you keep at it, you might be able to achieve your goal.
Marisha: No, it's localized.
Laura: No, but, the chains attaching two ships.
Marisha: Eh. We've got time.
Taliesin: That's the correct response.
Liam: She says as she destroys everything.
Travis: Yep, yeah, yep.
Marisha: Destroy reality?
Matt: Ending Keyleth's turn, it is now the crew's go. So the crew here is gonna turn the ballistas around, as the captain leaps off down and goes behind the guy who attacked you, Vax. She pulls out a scimitar, rushes forward screaming, "Yah!" and just does a full downward arc into the back.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Liam: Adele Dazeem, ladies and gentlemen.
Laura: Like Xena. (war cry)
Marisha: Adele Dazeem.
Laura: What does Xena do? (Xena fighting call)
Matt: That is 18. That hits.
Travis: That's it.
Liam: Yeah, that's it.
Matt: Second strike is a 23. Both hit.
Liam: She also breaks hearts.
Laura: Left and right.
Liam: Left and right.
Taliesin: Oh, man.
Liam: You can relate.
Travis: Disappointed!
Matt: That's better. 24 points of slashing damage. That ends her turn. These two guys are gonna fire ballistas at the ship. (firing sound, splash)
Travis: Yes! Yes!
Matt: One of them unfortunately just coasts off to the edge and misses the ship.
Travis: Damn it! He's fired.
Matt: The other one is a natural 20.
Travis: Boom!
Laura: Damn!
Matt: Oof, that's gonna be nasty. That, yeah, okay.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: That is 42 points of damage--
Travis: Damn. From one of the ballistas?
Matt: -- to the side of the ship. You watch as one of these ballistas has a similar-looking, like, giant iron arrow, but it's designed to just split and destroy wood on impact. It's pierced, but it seems to splinter out, so it hits, and then breaks as it goes.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Matt: And as it slams into the side of this ship, just above where Taryon and the other guy are. You watch as it (crashing sound) slams and wood splinters and breaks. The impact shakes the side. I'm actually gonna ask both you and that guy to make a strength saving throw.
Travis: Come on, buddy.
Sam: That's sorta cocked, but that's okay, I'll take it. That's a five.
Matt: Okay, both of you guys--
Sam: Maybe I'll use Luck, and go again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Sam: Ooh, yeah. Yeah, that's ten.
Matt: Okay, that's two. That's enough to hold on. The other guy did not make it. So you just hold on from the impact, the other guy (screams) falls back and splashes into--
Sam: You should've worn boat shoes! (all laugh)
Matt: Perfect.
Laura: I like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on.
Marisha: Boat shoes on!
Matt: As you hold on, you watch as the ballista, which has a chain attached to the back of it as well, is now being ratcheted back. And as it slams through and is pulled back, it's tearing sections of the ship apart. And you can watch now, as it's pulling down and breaking a whole section.
Sam: Jesus.
Matt: That's gonna go ahead and end this crewman's turn. This guy is gonna go ahead-- crossbow and try to line it up, towards-- I can only see the guy below, with disadvantage. Oh, it's a shame, it's a natural 20. And a 19, actually. Still manages to hit, even with the disadvantage from the fog cloud. Okay, that's eight damage to that guy. All righty. And then this guy over here is gonna move to the water elemental and take a strike on it and misses. (whoosh) It goes and strikes, but the water elemental shifts out of the way, the blade moves past, without an impact. End of the round, we have Taryon.
Sam: Yeah!
Marisha: Taryon!
Sam: Yeah! So, the guy right next to me is gone, right?
Matt: Yeah, he's splashed back. Both of these guys are in the water, back ten feet.
Sam: Oh, they're gone. Okay.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay, Can I see? No. I'm gonna climb up.
Matt: Okay, athletics check.
Sam: Okay.
Travis: Watch this go bad.
Sam: No, no. It's okay. 16?
Matt: Yeah, that could climb up and get onto the edge of the ship, right next to Keyleth, who's currently concentrating. You see her eyes kinda glowing, and her hands glowing with this faint aqua-look as the water is now, immediately to the right of her, curling up and splashing over the bow of the ship, and just pouring into the ship below.
Sam: So cool. So cool. Okay, I just yell back to Doty, Get rid of the grappling hooks! I don't know, I have no idea what I'm doing.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And then I see that the giant thing in front of me, right? Do I see the thing?
Matt: You do see it, yeah. It's currently bound by the series of thorny vines.
Sam: Great. I'll reach into my magic bag, and pull out a vial of acid and just throw it at the thing.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack. It is restrained, so you have advantage on the ranged attack roll.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: What do I add?
Matt: Add your-- it should say under the class.
Sam: My spell attack bonus?
Matt: It should say under the class's ability.
Sam: It says--
Matt: What's your bonus next to it on your sheet? Under your attacks.
Sam: Oh! Oh, it says--
Matt: It should be there.
Sam: No, it doesn't.
Matt: Doesn't? Ah, damn it.
Sam: Oh, wait, no, it says it. But it's cut off. It says, "DC one". I'm sure there's something after that, but are you talking about just to hit it?
Matt: Right. It's their saving throw. It's your spell DC to get past it; I think is what it is. It's not an actual ranged--
Sam: Okay, so then it's 17.
Matt: 17? Okay, good to know. Which, he has disadvantage on it, which he rolled a one in the first one, so no.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So go ahead and roll full damage.
Sam: Great, so that's 7d6.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: LED six!
Laura: They're really pretty.
Taliesin: They're really fun. Yeah, I like it. I know.
Marisha: LED. Six.
Sam: 26.
Matt: 26 points of acid damage.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: Nice.
Taliesin: That's good.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does he let out a fishy scream?
Matt: You watch as you lob your vial, it (shattering sound) burst across the creature's chest--
Taliesin: (gurgling)
Matt: --and the acid (burning sound) begins to burn, burning part of the vines that currently keep it restrained, but--
Sam: Oh, shit! Sorry, sorry! I don't know how this stuff works!
Matt: But it does burn. You see it (gurgling grunts) trying desperately to break free, as you see the smoke of its burning flesh rise up off its body (sizzling sound).
Sam: Okay.
Matt: End your turn, Taryon?
Sam: I have a bonus action. I'll use Sanctuary. On myself.
Matt: Okay. There you go. And with that, Doty's gonna go ahead and reach down and try and grab-- nope. Not with a four. As you see, (creaking noise) you hear the metal kind of creaking, but not getting any sort of actual--
Marisha: Aw.
Taliesin: Knees, not back.
Matt: I know.
Travis: Lift with your knees.
Taliesin: God, robot!
Matt: All right, ending that round, that brings us to the top. The rushing waters: the ships continue to move forward; both of these guys shift backward.
Liam: Bye!
Matt: They're being left behind by the boats.
Taliesin: Good!
Matt: They're trying to swim forward. That brings us to Marid. Okay.
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months.
Matt: So this guy is currently up in the side. And he's looking around, he's gonna make a quick perception check, just to look around. He got shot by you. He got shot by you. He's gonna go ahead and glance up in your direction. He's gonna go ahead and use a Water Jet ability against you.
Taliesin: All right.
Matt: Actually, let's see here--
Travis: Water Jet.
Laura: (explosion sound)
Matt: You know what, now? No, he's not.
Travis: He's not?
Matt: He is, but he's gonna use a Water Jet--
Laura: Is he not grappled anymore?
Matt: He's still grappled. He's restrained, but he can still do abilities.
Laura: Oh, shit.
Taliesin: We're fine.
Matt: 60, fine. Yeah, you're up there, but it sees the cluster in that direction. That's his own guy. He won't do that.
Travis: He wouldn't?
Laura: Ooh, honorable.
Matt: Hold on, I'm trying to see what's the most useful--
Sam: Maybe they're family.
Laura: Maybe they are.
Matt: He can't move. He can't angle it. It's really frustrating for him.
Liam: For him, right? For him? It's frustrating for him.
Matt: Yeah, for him.
Travis: It really frustrates him.
Matt: And for that, he's gonna aim for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: What is he doing, what?
Matt: Aiming for Trinket and Vax.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: So, all of a sudden, it turns its head this way, opens its mouth (hoarse gasp) and you watch as this small spiral of  greenish energy begins to swirl. And a singular burst of extremely accelerated water just (hard impact sound) fires through the fog out of sight. You hear this (whoosh) sound, and you turn just in time to watch as it blasts towards both you and Trinket. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, and Trinket as well.
Liam: Vax or Vex?
Matt: Vax.
Liam: Vax. Yeah, you're fine.
Laura: Yeah, I'm fine.
Liam: Oh, you're doing Trinket, right.
Laura: Whoa! Trinket rolled so good!
Liam: 17.
Matt: 17?
Laura: Hold on, hold on, holda.
Sam: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda.
Laura: Hoda, hoda, hoda, hoda. 20!
Matt: All righty. So Trinket manages to (whoosh) duck down, taking half the damage.
Laura: He was very zen about that duck down.
Travis: (Trinket groans)
Laura: Matrix style, he's diving in. No.
Matt: So 15 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket. 30 to you, Vax.
Liam: But halved, 'cause if I fail, it's halved. If I succeed, it's zero. It's a dexterity so it's Evasion.
Matt: Yeah. Evasion--
Liam: Evasion is for dex saves. If I fail, I take half damage, and if I succeed I take no damage.
Sam: Ooh! That's sexy.
Matt: Right.
Liam: It's how I survive dragon fights.
Matt: Yes, yes.
Travis: (singing) How I survive dragon fights.
Sam: Guys, we're having a water battle.
Laura: You guys!
Taliesin: I've been waiting for this for so long.
Laura: Well, we're having a pirate battle.
Travis: Super soaker!
Sam: Super soakers!
Taliesin: Super soakers!
Travis: Super soaker 250, super soaker 500, super soaker 1000. You remember those?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Sam: Yeah. I didn't know they had gauges.
Taliesin: Oh, yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So you take 15 points of bludgeoning damage. However, you are pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone.
Sam: Ooh. Ooh.
Laura: Oh, no.
Sam: Off the ship?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: (whoosh) Off the edge of the ship.
Sam: Oh! No!
Laura: (gasps) Bro!
Matt: He (splash) into the water below. (splash) It's with such force, that you aren't even given a chance to grab at the ship. You're thrust off at an arc.
Liam: Mm-hm.
Matt: And (splash) into the water. (splash) into the ocean--
Laura: Gosh, thank god Trinket ducked.
Matt: -- soaking you down into the wave. The elemental creature swirls up and occupies both the space of Grog and Trinket, and is going to go ahead and turn it into a whelm. So it's going to uh, attempt to whelm both of you, and I need you and Trinket to make strength saving throws.
Travis: Strength saving throws. I have advantage because I'm raging. 26.
Laura: 18.
Matt: All righty. You guys, both pushed out of its space. So it forces you out. However, you both manage to escape any sort of damage as its giant spiral, this whirlwind of water spins around and you both barely force your way out of it before it can do any serious damage to you.
Laura: Bearly.
Matt: All right, that leads us to Vax's turn.
Liam: Okay, so in the water, click the boots, and the wings shoot-out, and I explode up, out of the water into the air.
Sam: Wow, so cool.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And I just start gunning it towards the guy who knocked me in, right?
Matt: Okay.
Liam: And when I'm about, I don't know, 30 feet away from him, I'm gonna-- because I'm hasted I get 120 feet of movement just for regular movement.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: And when I'm within 40 feet, I'm gonna throw Whisper at the guy.
Matt: Okay, that will put you about there.
Liam: Yep.
Travis: Hit him. Hit him!
Liam: That's 26?
Matt: 26? All righty, that hits.
Liam: And I'm gonna bamf right up to him as I hit.
Matt: (poof)
Liam: That is just a little ten, plus-- 15.
Matt: 15 points of damage with that strike. Okay.
Liam: And I should have one more. So I used bonus action for the wings, I did movement, I did action, so I've got one more action.
Matt: Your offhand attack, yeah.
Liam: Yeah. So I will shank him again.
Travis: Shank shank!
Laura: Shank shank!
Sam: Is that a new thing? Shank shank?
Matt: You have advantage on these strikes now. Because you're right up against him, and he is restrained.
Liam: 20.
Matt: 20 hits. And you do get your Sneak Attack, because of your advantage on him.
Travis: No more dagger dagger dagger.
Sam: Just shank shank?
Laura: It's just two. It's shank shank.
Sam: Okay.
Liam: That is just a nine! And I'll unload some poison into him as well. The DC is 15.
Marisha: I feel like 'shank shank' is less attractive on a t-shirt.
Matt: That is a nine. He does not succeed!
Liam: Okay, so he takes 2d10. Do I roll that, or do you, Matty?
Matt: You roll that.
Liam: All right.
Matt: So what's the damage initially?
Liam: It's nine. Plus 13 poison damage.
Matt: Okay, so 22. Are you gonna roll Sneak Attack damage?
Liam: Why would I get that here? Is he up against anybody?
Matt: No, you have advantage on him because he is restrained.
Liam: Oh, advantage, yay, I love you.
Matt: And he is not immune to poison.
Liam: 20 Sneak Attack damage. Thanks, Matt.
Matt: How much is that total?
Liam: 20 for the sneak attack.
Matt: 20 for the sneak attack. 20 plus 22.
Laura: You're attacking the guy?
Matt: We'll see if he maintains concentration.
Laura: How'd you get all the way over there?
Matt: He does not. So. Let me double-check one thing real fast, here, because this will be interesting.
Liam: Shank-shank-shank. Shank-shank-shank.
Liam: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Taliesin: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Laura: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Marisha: (singing) Shank your booty. Shank your booty.
Matt: Okay, got you. So he loses concentration. He is now poisoned and restrained. He has to make a saving throw, actually, to see-- which he did not. So yeah, still restrained.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: Whoof. That sucks. Okay, that ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Awesome.
Liam: Get him!
Laura: Cool, then since he's got my brother next to him, I'm gonna fly down so I can see him better, and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one.
Liam: She shouts as she flies through the air.
Laura: Blazing bowstring! Activate!
Marisha: (electric guitar sounds)
Laura: Do I still get disadvantage?
Matt: You do, the fog is still present.
Laura: Okay. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Second attack?
Laura: Second attack is just-- can I do regular?
Matt: Yes, that's fine.
Laura: 18.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Laura: 12 with three points of lightning damage.
Travis: Did you add your Hunter's Mark?
Laura: I'm about to. 13 additional. And then ten with the blazing bowstring-- nine more with the blazing bowstring.
Matt: Nice, all right.
Laura: And then my second attack--
Matt: Correct.
Laura: 11 plus three lightning.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I don't get Sneak Attack again, but I do get Hunter's Mark.
Matt: You do get Hunter's Mark, yes.
Laura: And three more for Hunter's Mark.
Matt: Nice. So, after he's stabbed in the side, and the poison pulses through his system, turns around, and as the arrow slams into him, burst of flame and lightning arcs through his body.
Laura: And I'm gonna fly back a little so he can see me less. And then I'm going to have Trinket, for my bonus action--
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: -- run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship.
Liam: Is it a leap year?
Marisha: This hasn't happened in like 20 games.
Laura: I know, I know.
Marisha: Oh my god.
Matt: Is Trinket doing just a regular attack?
Laura: Yeah, because it's my bonus, so he can just do one attack.
Matt: Because if you wanted to, instead of going for a damaging attack, you can go for a shove.
Laura: Oh, I could? I didn't think I was allowed to do that.
Matt: Yeah, you can do it, you can sacrifice an attack for a shove strike. It doesn't do damage.
Laura: I want him to do that. That's what I wanted him to do.
Matt: I was wondering if that's what you were going for. Okay, so go ahead and roll an athletics check for Trinket.
Laura: Athletics... is that strength? That's just five.
Matt: Five? Okay, yeah, so Trinket goes up and slams into the guy, and he gets pushed against the side of the ship, but not with enough force to shove him over the edge, and he (grunt) catches himself.
Laura: So Trinket just stands up, he's got his paws on his chest.
Matt: Just pressing (growls) on there, yeah.
Laura: Growls loudly into his face.
Liam: (growls)
Matt: All right, that ends your turn. Percy, you're up.
Laura: I mean, that's scary, a big bear. Especially if these guys are on the sea. They don't see bears very often.
Taliesin: All right. That guy's still in the vines, right?
Matt: Correct, yes.
Taliesin: He's becoming a problem, though. Okay, I'm going to, if I can pull this off, is it possible that I can break the rope that I'm currently holding onto and do a little Errol Flynn like fly down to the bottom of the boat?
Matt: You can do that, yeah.
Taliesin: Is it possible that the rope I have to shoot is in between me and him?
Matt: Uh... sure.
Marisha: You going to kill two birds with one stone?
Taliesin: I'm going to use a piercing shot, and I'm going to try to do both with one shot and Errol Flynn this shit.
Travis: Oh shit! Oh shit!
Matt: Okay. Make an acrobatics check as part of this.
Marisha: Errol Flynn this shit, is that what you said?
Matt: This is specifically the kind of shit acrobatics is for.
Travis: Totally. 100%. Swashbuckling.
Taliesin: Acrobatics... that's a 23.
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and take it-- still at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Still at disadvantage.
Matt: Because of the fog.
Marisha: Oh man, now you're in an Angelina Jolie movie.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: Nope?
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny, because I was using the Animus.
Matt: Yes.
Taliesin: So depending on how mean you wanna be here, I'm gonna take my 2d6.
Matt: Oh, you misfire?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: So this is gonna be funny. I'm gonna take my 2d6, and that's six points of psychic damage to me, that's cool, that's cool.
Marisha: What if one day you died because of that?
Matt: Okay, so you use your piercing shot to shoot both at him and to shoot the-- or to shoot the rope and then swing down?
Taliesin: Yes. So does the psychic damage mean I let go of the rope I'm holding on to? Or does it not? Also, my feet are sticky and my hand has--
Matt: Your feet are sticky, but your hands are not.
Taliesin: But my hands are not.
Matt: It's the blast of psychic energy. You know what? I'll say go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm down for this.
Matt: Yes, make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can withstand the blast to your brain as your vision goes white.
Taliesin: So that's an eight.
Liam: Goes in the drink.
Matt: Nope.
Taliesin: Here's the next question  do I have any chance of grabbing anything with my hands and feet on the way down?
Matt: Unfortunately, no. What happens is, as you grab the rope and you fire-- as you slash the rope and go to swing down, you go to fire, and as you do, it backs up, and your vision just goes white and you feel your whole body go instantaneously numb. You're not sure if you're even holding the rope anymore. All of your--
Taliesin: So I'm just gonna wake up on the deck of the floor of the boat.
Matt: -- and the pain sears in your brain, you hear the (heartbeat) the pulse of pain through, and as your vision comes to, it clarifies, and color comes back just in time for you to see the surface of the ship rocketing towards your face. (impact sound) And you slam into the ground, straight across, landing prone at the base of the ground in front of the fish creature.
Laura: Oh, no!
Travis: It was so cool!
Laura: That one was seriously bad.
Sam: Can I yell out, No! New best friend!
Matt: You can. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the fall.
Taliesin: 12 points of bludgeoning damage. And can I burn a bonus action, am I okay, or--
Matt: You could use-- I mean, that was your action, you land, yeah. You're still prone, but you can still use the rest of your attacks if you want.
Marisha: I'm sorry, your best friend?
Taliesin: I can use the rest of my actions?
Matt: I mean, that was an attack. The piercing shot. So you still have your two other attacks, if you wanted to use them.
Taliesin: Just because it hurts and I'm irritated, I'm just gonna pull out Retort and fire in the general direction.
Matt: Okay, so two more strikes, both at disadvantage.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Sam: (gunshot sounds)
Taliesin: Oh, that's not bad.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Taliesin: 28?
Matt: 28 hits.
Marisha: That's not as good.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: 16 does not hit.
Taliesin: Okay, so the 28 one does, though. That's seven points of damage.
Matt: Seven points of damage. Got it. Okay. So as you roll over on your back and pull out Retort and just fire two shots, one just goes off into the fog. You see it tear through the ship mast for a second, some wood splinters, the other one, you hear the creature take the impact from the blow. You're not even really paying attention where it's going, you're just hearing the sound and shooting in that direction. All right, that'll end your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: Oh yeah.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: What a turn. What a terrible way to go.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: I wanna keep hitting the water elemental.
Matt: All right. So, you turn towards it over there. Go for it.
Travis: Reckless attacks, please.
Matt: Yes.
Travis: First one's a 30.
Matt: That'll hit.
Travis: 21 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Second attack. It's very methodical. 26.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Does that hit?
Matt: Yes.
Travis: And 17 points of damage.
Matt: 17 points of damage, all right. So you rush in and slam twice in this elemental again. You see its form with each hit is just splattering water against the ground, and where once it came up as this solid force of water, it's starting to have difficulty keeping its form together. Where once it was focused genuinely on you and Trinket, it seems to be lashing out now in a frenzied state, it's just punching all around. Does that finish your turn?
Travis: Am I not good enough to hold your attention? Yeah, that finishes my turn.
Matt: Okay. Got you. All right. This guy here's gonna squeeze past the side.
Laura: Trinket attacks him on the way over.
Matt: He hasn't moved away from Trinket yet.
Laura: Damn it.
Matt: Actually, no, he's gonna squeeze this way instead because Grog's on that side. He's gonna go ahead and move past the bear and let Trinket push his weight into the side of the ship, and is going to go ahead and take three strikes at you, Grog.
Travis: Yay!
Matt: With advantage.
Travis: Another play-friend.
Matt: That's gonna be two strikes against you and one against Trinket. First one with advantage is gonna be a 24.
Travis: Hits!
Matt: Dagger is gonna be a 15.
Travis: Misses. With advantage too?
Matt: Yeah, his first attack roll was a one. All right, so you take ten points of piercing damage, reduced to five.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And then the other rapier attack's gonna go against Trinket. Which is a natural one. Jesus.
Travis: Wow.
Matt: So he just swings and Trinket catches the blade in his teeth, and he draws the rapier back, which is now covered in bear slobber.
Travis: This is not the time to choke, buddy.
Matt: That ends his turn. This guy here is gonna go ahead and turn to face off with Captain Adella. He's gonna make three strikes against her.
Marisha: C'mon, Adele Dazeem.
Matt: That's gonna hit. First rapier strike, second rapier strike, and the dagger, all three hit, unfortunately.
Laura: We're all such dicks.
Travis: You guys are awful.
Marisha: We've got these shitty nicknames for everyone.
Matt: 14, and, okay. Total of 21 points of damage on her.
Travis: 21 points.
Matt: So as she tries to parry to the side, the pirate just catches her off-guard and gets three good hits in, but Adella parries off to the side, gets pushed back a bit, and then forces her way forward, preparing her counter-attack.
Travis: Come on!
Matt: That brings us to--
Travis: We should probably protect the captain.
Matt: -- Keyleth.
Sam: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, shit. We're still attached to this boat, right?
Sam: Multiple times.
Matt: Currently, yes. If you're still concentrating on this, the water's still pouring into it.
Marisha: I am. How much slack do we have before I start pulling our boat underwater, because I don't want to be that-- kinda thought someone would start--
Matt: It depends, right now it'll be probably two rounds before it begins to genuinely start sinking heavily. Depending on if the ballista get another shot at the side or not.
Marisha: I wanna keep doing this. Can I concentrate my flooding of water so-- there's now a hole in the side of the ship, under where Tary was, right? I had to think not to say Scanlan.
Matt: Correct.
Marisha: I wanna flood in more water. Can I flood it more on this side, to where I try and-- or can I do something fancy, like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and--
Taliesin: Kind of like Fantasia?
Marisha: -- take the fish-head guy?
Travis: What the shit?
Marisha: Or can I at least try and flood that side to where I can try and toss him over?
Matt: You can either choose to continue to flood the ship, or use Control Water to attack the fish character. One or the other.
Travis: Don't look at us, man.
Marisha: Let me see if I can Control Water and take a wave to toss him overboard.
Matt: Toss him overboard?
Laura: He's a fish! That'll help him.
Marisha: He is a fish.
Matt: He is very plainly a fish-based creature.
Marisha: He is very definitely a fish.
Matt: The lower half of his body is a swirl of water.
Marisha: Oh, right.
Travis: So put him in the water.
Laura: I don't think putting him in the water's gonna help us very much.
Travis: Water and water makes--
Marisha: You know, I'll just keep sinking this ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I'm gonna keep concentrating.
Laura: You could get rid of the fog.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: I can't do that right now.
Matt: The torrent of water continues to shove down into the ship. You've redirected it. As it's pouring into the side, you use your other hand to pick up another portion of water and start spraying it into the wound that was left right above, Taryon, you're getting sprayed by water overhead as it's just traveling over you like an Epcot Center water fountain.
Marisha: You're good, right, Tary?
Sam: Yes?
Marisha: All right.
Sam: This is so weird!
Marisha: Good! This is like a Tuesday for us.
Matt: All right, so the crew on this side, this guy's gonna go ahead and move up higher up there and take a swing. Misses, unfortunately. This guy's gonna take another crossbow shot down at the one that's attacking the captain. That will hit, actually.
Travis: Yes! Get him!
Laura: Get him!
Matt: All righty. And then these two guys are gonna take two more ballista shots as they load up, pull it back. This guy continues-- actually, this guy doesn't get a shot, because he spent the last round winching and pulling it back, so he gets one shot retracting. This guy managed to pull it back and take a secondary shot at the ship. That hits. It's not a critical, but it's still pretty decent. That is 14 points of damage on the side of the ship. This one slams into it maybe about five feet to the left. Keyleth, actually all of you who are on the ship, you feel the impact as the second blow hits, and it pulls out the side, this time much lower, and water is now really pushing, the ship is slowly starting to capsize to one side. That ends that group's turn.
Sam: I've read about this. Many of us will die. (all laugh)
Matt: Tary, it's your turn.
Sam: My turn?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Okay. Is there water all over the deck, is it hard to move, is it okay?
Matt: I mean, it's wet, and the deck is currently listing to one side.
Sam: Okay.
Laura: Is it listing towards Keyleth and--
Matt: It's listing this way.
Travis: Boat shoes!
Sam: Yeah, those are like impervious to water. (all laugh)
Sam: Okay. Once again, I'll yell back at Doty and just say, Ahh! The thing with the grappling hooks again!
Matt: Doty actually does succeed this turn. (all cheer)
Matt: Doty lifts it out, and now that it's starting to pull, the chains are very taut, as this ship lists, the ship's being pulled a little ways towards it, the chains are strained, so as soon as Doty pulls it up, it just goes firing off the side and plunges off the water to the other side. The ship's now beginning to slowly turn this way as the other chain is now tugging it from that direction, and this is now listing to that side. So, what are you doing, Tary?
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to cast Haste as my action. And I get a second action, now, because I'm hasted, right?
Matt: You get to use a second action that's a melee attack.
Sam: It has to be a melee attack?
Matt: Melee attack, disengage, hide...
Sam: Can I use-- it said I could use a magic item.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Or use an item, use an item.
Matt: Yeah, use an object.
Sam: Oh, use an object, not an item. I can't use my ring or anything, right?
Matt: I'll say, for the purposes of this? Sure. Why not?
Sam: Okay, so I'm hasted, I will use, I pick up the Ring of the Ram, and I'll ram the fish-man.
Travis: Oh, yes!
Laura: Oh, nice!
Matt: Okay. How many charges does it have?
Travis: Ring of the Ram, that's been a while.
Sam: Three charges, right? So I can use two?
Matt: You can use as many charges as you want that the ring holds. It should tell you up to a certain amount--
Sam: It has three charges.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Well, it says I can use an action to expend one to three of its charges. Okay. I'll do all three, right? (all laugh)
Matt: All right. So, it is still restrained, so go ahead and roll with advantage an attack roll plus seven.
Sam: Ooh. 19.
Matt: With advantage?
Sam: Oh. Natural 20. (all cheer)
Matt: Oh, shit. Well. Okay. Roll 6d10 force damage.
Travis: Holy shit. 6d10?
Taliesin: How many do you need?
Matt: Well, then we double what he rolled, because it's a critical.
Marisha: Six, you need six?
Travis: And that's force damage.
Sam: Okay. 35. 70.
Matt: 70 points of force damage against the creature. So as you focus on your ring, there's a burst of divine white-looking energy that turns into this giant plate-like shield in front of you, and it just stays there. You're like, huh? And suddenly it thrusts forward, and out the front of it, like a portal, a giant spectral ram-head just slams into the chest, throwing it off the ship, as it screams, it just turns into sea foam. (all cheer)
Travis: You killed it!
Matt: It's scattered into the ocean across from you. It is destroyed.
Sam: Can it be like a kid who's holding a rifle, but not up to him, so it hits him and it really throws me back a little?
Matt: Which, yeah, sure. Roll a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Five.
Matt: Off the ship, into the water.
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Splash! Into the water.
Travis: Back in the drink again!
Marisha: Are there still bad guys left?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: There are. There's two over here, and there's two currently in the water below. Ending your turn--
Marisha: But nothing left on the ship, right?
Laura: That we see?
Marisha: That we see?
Matt: Correct. These guys are trying to swim forward. That was cocked. Nope. These guys, at the top of the round, get pushed back.
Marisha: Bye!
Matt: Taryon--
Sam: I lost Alter Self when I hasted.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just generally swimming, but you also float back in the ocean. You're now caught in the water behind, so the ship carries on without you.
Taliesin: And that was the last anyone saw of Taryon Darrington. (all laugh)
Matt: All right.
Marisha: He got his $50,000 worth.
Matt: The water elemental's going to go ahead and take two slam attacks.
Sam: You there! Hello.
Matt: It's taking a slam attack against Grog, it's taking a slam attack against the pirate.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So against Grog, it has advantage on you because you used reckless.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: That is a 23.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: 16 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to eight.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: And against the pirate, that hits. And the elemental reaches around, and as it punches Grog in the face, it slams the other pirate in the head, its fist engulfing his head, and he just kind of stands there, trying to find a way out, and it just drowns him while it's standing, and it drops the body to the ground.
Laura: Oh, fuck.
Travis: Oh, it killed him?
Matt: Yeah, it lashed out.
Laura: One of our guys?
Matt: Did enough damage-- no, one of the pirates.
Laura: Oh, shit. He is untameable.
Matt: Vax, you're up.
Liam: You know when you look at a cat that's alarmed because it's nervous and all the hair is puffed out? Vax's feathers are all going like pffft, watching Keyleth wreck the boat, I could fucking watch you do this all day. Up into the air, and I go and get Tary out of the water.
Sam: Aw!
Matt: You go grab Tary.
Liam: And I'm gonna pick him up and dump him back on our boat, towards the back of the ship.
Matt: Okay, carrying him, we'll say you're at half speed, so that gets you just to the edge of the ship.
Liam: Cool. I'm good. Wait, no, do I have an action left? Can I use Divine Sense right now?
Matt: As you're hasted, you have the haste action...
Liam: Yeah, I am hasted.
Matt: I'll say you can use Divine Sense, sure.
Liam: Okay. I pat him down and go, we're good, we're good, and I'm just gonna make sure he's not a demon.
Matt: Oh. Taryon.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: A demon? What?
Laura: Why a demon?
Marisha: What? Why would you think he's a demon?
Sam: Guys, the conclusion of the epic series Shades of Magic, A Conjuring of Light, was just released, so go pick it up. It's put out by Tor books, a leading publisher of science fiction and fantasy for over three decades.
Matt: Okay. That ends Vax's turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'll fly over to Percy, who's on the fucking ground.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: And I say, are you good?
Taliesin: It was worth it. Good.
Laura: Lovely. Get off this boat. And I'll fly over and try to help out the fight on the other side.
Matt: Okay. We'll say that's 20... 40... yeah, you can get over here.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You'd still be just above the fray.
Laura: And then I'll shoot some arrows at--
Matt: There's one guy left, and the elemental.
Laura: I'll shoot 'em at the guy.
Matt: Okay, go ahead for two strikes on that.
Laura: Yeah. Oh, disadvantage, too?
Matt: The fog is still around, so yes.
Laura: Oh, damn it. Okay.
Travis: Oh, one of them was a--
Laura: Yeah, but. 20 on the first one, and 15 plus seven on the second one. 22.
Matt: Both hit. Roll damage.
Laura: Awesome.
Marisha: You have a d3?
Sam: I need a d3.
Taliesin: It's a d6.
Marisha: It's a d6 cut in half.
Sam: Wait, two, four, six or something? Okay.
Laura: Oh, Jesus, this is terrible, this is terrible.
Taliesin: There is actually a d3 that has two ones, two twos, and two threes.
Laura: 17. Plus three lightning damage. And then... 16 plus two lightning damage. And then for my bonus action, Trinket's gonna-- and it was Sneak Attack, because there's something next to him, huh?
Matt: Correct.
Laura: (cackles) Five for sneak attack!
Matt: All righty.
Laura: And then Trinket will attack him too.
Matt: Roll an attack for Trinket.
Laura: Okay.
Liam: (bear noises)
Laura: Yes. That is-- what is that, a bite attack?
Matt: Whichever one you decide.
Laura: Sure, it's a bite attack. A 24.
Matt: That hits. Roll damage.
Laura: It's 11.
Matt: 11. As both arrows staple, one into the guy's knee, he falls down to the ground on one knee. The other one hits him in the side of the body, and he looks up just as Trinket chomps down over his head. (all cheer)
Matt: And just crunches down. You watch as his skull collapses with the force of the bear's jaw, and the arms just go limp at the sides. (all cheer)
Matt: Trinket then shakes him a bit, and his limp body just goes whoompf, whoompf, just slamming and breaking into the side of the ship, and then drops it on the ground, and Trinket turns around and looks in your direction.
Laura: Good job, boy!
Liam: That made us all so happy.
Laura: Yeah, it's great.
Marisha: See a guy get thrashed.
Laura: I wish Scanlan could've been here to see that.
Matt: All righty.
Sam: 87 episodes. One kill.
Laura: He's had more than one.
Matt: Two of the guys are trying to swim, but they're not able to keep up. You just watch them slowly vanish behind you in the fog. All right, Percy?
Taliesin: The water elemental's still a problem, I take it?
Matt: You can see it still lashing out, yes.
Travis: And there's one hook left.
Taliesin: I'm going to stand up, dust myself off, pull out Bad News, take careful aim-- slightly irritated aim at that water elemental, and see what happens.
Matt: Go for it. Disadvantage on the shot.
Taliesin: Disadvantage on the shot.
Travis: Has the fog not dissipated because fish-head got done with?
Laura: No.
Taliesin: Not yet. I'm actually going to spend a grit to gain my advantage back.
Matt: Okay. Go for it.
Taliesin: Come on. Thank god I didn't do that too weird. That's 20.
Matt: 20 hits.
Taliesin: I'm also gonna blow through most of Cabal's Ruin, 'cause that's funny. I know, I say that a lot. So that's standard damage, is 15 points of damage, plus where is--
Marisha: 1d4 plus four... 1d6 lightning damage per charge expended.
Taliesin: Okay, 1d6 per charge. You know? Let's end this. Should we just end this?
Marisha: That's good. Lightning's bad for water. Not that I'd know.
Taliesin: I figured it would be. I'm just gonna blow eight of the charges, so do you have five more--
Marisha: Yeah, I do. Five more, of course. Dream come true, make it happen.
Laura: If this doesn't end it...
Taliesin: So plus (counting) 23 points of lightning damage on top of that.
Matt: Okay, so as you bring Bad News down and aim across the way, fire the bullet, it blasts across, and you guys see this glow of electrical energy that just shoots through the air, the bullet enhanced by the Cabal's Ruin vestige enchantment. As it blasts into the side of the elemental, the elemental gets blown back through the air, and as it does, it just vaporizes. (all cheer)
Marisha: Is that everyone done?
Matt: All the enemies currently seem to be not on the ship, or dragging behind. However, (creaking noise)
Taliesin: I'm going to stop, I'm going to wave, and I'm going to go walk over and start looking to see if I can see what that glow is. I'm going to deactivate this, because I want to loot this ship.
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Ooh, that's better. That's 25.
Matt: 25. You glance in the side, and you see now, there is a singular small palantír-type orb, but smaller, that is a foggy gray color on the inside that's slowly swirling, and you can see it's gathering condensation and mist around it.
Taliesin: Does there seem to be any mechanism for turning it off or otherwise?
Matt: It looks like it's just embedded into it.
Marisha: Take it with us, take it with us.
Taliesin: I'm going to at least try and pick it up, and--
Matt: Make a strength check.
Taliesin: Okay.
Liam: While he's busy, I'm gonna jet over next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Oh, are we in combat rounds?
Matt: We're going to stay in order for a second.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Matt: There is a bit of a--
Taliesin: That's adorable.
Marisha: That's sad.
Taliesin: Three.
Matt: (straining sound) You feel something pop in your back shoulder, and your right arm gets a little numb.
Taliesin: That's so mean. (all laugh)
Liam: It's like when you just reach out to pick up something--
Marisha: Yeah, you never know. Getting old, man.
Taliesin: There's no way to--
Matt: As you go over to it, you see it's there, but it's currently held in place by something that's beneath the orb, or at least it's either adhered or glued to or held there, you just don't have the strength to lift it.
Taliesin: There's gotta be a way to turn this off.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Marisha: I shout to--
Matt: It's Grog's turn, actually.
Marisha: Sorry.
Travis: I go over to the harpoon hook, and like, fuck this harpoon hook. Can I try and get it out of the ship with my strength?
Matt: Sure, go ahead and roll a strength check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Hey. 25.
Matt: One-handed.
Laura: Hey!
Matt: (tink, fwoomp) And it just flies out of your grip from the tension out of the ship. You have to pull your hand back 'cause the-- one of the giant gnarled edges of it almost take your arm off in the process.
Travis: (gasp)
Laura: You almost lost that gauntlet!
Matt: It tears a section of the edge of this boat off. Just the railing on the side kind of pulls through it immediately.
Travis: I'll pay for that.
Matt: Trinket has to pull off to the side and the one guy kind of backs up immediately as it shoots off into the water below. For you guys, the ship, now that it doesn't have the tension to the side, is now capsizing very quickly and turning on the side.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Travis: I feel like I did something bad.
Marisha: That was cool!
Travis: Oopsie.
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I say  Hey guys! Cruises are really trashy! (laughs)
Travis: Jokes while you're doing that.
Marisha: And I still have Control Water going.
Liam: Tip your waiters.
Marisha: Can I flush out the bottom of the cruise ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the bow with what water is there? Just kind of (whoof)?
Taliesin: Like a spigot.
Matt: You're kinda off to the side. You can look down, it's not very well-lit on the inside at all. Like, it is not lit on the interior. You do have your elven darkvision for a few feet, so you have to glance over and look into the room below, but right now all you're seeing is seafoam and ocean pouring into the side of the ship.
Marisha: Okay, I stop sinking the boat. Because we're not dying.
Matt: Okay. The ship is still sinking. You filled it with water, and currently the side of it has been blasted twice.
Marisha: I bring the water up like a fountain of wealth and youth. Just coming up. Out of the bottom. (all laugh)
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Wow.
Marisha: Just other way.
Liam: Oh, boy!
Marisha: Seeing what comes out from the bottom of the ship.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Hopefully not dead bodies or like--
Taliesin: (sings) It's rainin' men...
Laura: I know, if there were slaves--
Marisha: Slave trade or something sad-- yeah, like slave.
Laura: Fingers crossed. Let's not do that to Keyleth.
Marisha: Oh, come on!
Travis: It's just kids!
Marisha: He's looking at his notes like it's a thing!
Travis: It's just kids.
All: (laughs and groans)
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Marisha: That's my worst nightmare!
Matt: You're terrible!
Travis: Kids and puppies!
Liam: Gosh!
Matt: Okay, so as the water comes rushing up from underneath, you see a lot of genuinely soaked food items come shooting up, large chunks of broken wood, what appear to be additional iron ballista spears.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: And lots of chain come firing up from the inside.
Marisha: Watch your head! Points!
Matt: Furniture, chairs, occasionally (water sound effects) just pieces of broken things from the interior. You're not seeing much else than that at the moment.
Marisha: Aw. These were lame pirates! No treasure.
Taliesin: Let's get the orb at the very least.
Matt: (sarcastically) Good pirates keep all their treasure on their ship at all times.
Marisha: Lame! (all laugh)
Liam: Just hundreds and hundreds of NES classics.
Laura: We really should've kept one of them alive.
Travis: Do you wanna check the captain's quarters before it all goes down?
Laura: Yeah! What if there's a map to treasure?
Liam: (sighs) Looks like it's going down pretty fast, though, yeah?
Travis: Those of you on the boat--
Taliesin: Doing it now-- yes, we want to it now while there's an order of operations based on a die roll!
Marisha: I have control! I have control!
Matt: Taryon!
Sam: Yes?
Matt: Anything you wish to add to this circumstance? You're now soaking wet, but your winged savior has lifted you down onto the edge of the ship.
Liam: (ting)
Taliesin: (sings) And I would do anything for love.
Sam: How many of you can fly?
Liam: Two or three, give or take.
Sam: Amazing! Incredible! Stupendous! No, I have nothing to add, other than-- do you need my assistance in cleaning up any of these ruffians? Oh, also, one question.
Liam: Yeah?
Sam: Did I hurt the beast?
Liam: Man, you did great! You knocked that guy clear off!
Sam: Really?
Liam: Yeah.
Sam: I killed it!
Liam: That's a good start, man.
Sam: What was it?
Liam: What was it?
Sam: Yes!
Liam: Oh, you need to ask the white-haired one. I dunno.
Sam: Okay!
Taliesin: Oh, that's me!
Sam: Was it bad?
Liam: The worst!
Matt: All right, so you spend your turn conversing.
Liam: Yes.
Sam: Pretty much!
Liam: Six seconds of dialogue, right there!
Matt: All right, we'll say for the pace of things here, guys, the ship is maybe 30 seconds from fully sinking into the water. Anybody you guys wanna--
Laura: 30 seconds?
Liam: I'm gonna do what I said before, and I'm gonna go and land next to Keyleth.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: See if we can grab the orb. I'm gonna run downstairs and see if I can see paperwork in the captain's quarters or anything-- or run in the captain's quarters and just do a massive loot, really, just as quick as I can.
Matt: Investigation check with disadvantage. The room is currently tilted pretty heavily, and everything has slid and collided onto one side of the room. It's just a giant pile of broken furniture.
Marisha: I said I balanced it out and that I'm kind of doing that.
Travis: You want me to jump over there and go get the orb?
Laura: Yeah!
Marisha: We also kinda put a bunch of holes into the side of it.
Matt: Yeah, there are a bunch of holes in the ship--
Marisha: So I can only do so much.
Matt: Your Control Water can localize some cool effects, but overall the ship itself has taken too much damage.
Travis: Can I use my boots of Feral leaping to leap from one ship to the other?
Matt: Sure, make an athletics check.
Laura: I want to fly down and help Percy investigate. If there's time.
Liam: We're pretty flush already. Let's make it quick.
Taliesin: Well, there might be something magic. Okay. My investigation check is 19.
Matt: 19 with disadvantage?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: Nice! All right, pulling from the inside and rummaging through, you find--
Taliesin: Any papers I'm just gonna grab.
Matt: Yeah, you grab whatever papers you can, there's a small leather tube, you grab that. Looking about inside, there's a ring of keys. You find a bunch of scattered coins throughout the room. It looks like there was a couple of small chests that just opened up and--
Taliesin: I'm looking more for magic, I don't care about gold-- magic or weird.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: Catch the eye. Are the keys, like--
Matt: They look like some sort of opening device, yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, no. Okay, yeah, I'm gonna grab them anyway.
Matt: Okay. So you grab the keys. Cool. All right.
Travis: 22. To jump across.
Matt: To jump across, okay. So you make it across, and you try and go underneath now. The ship, now, not only is it listing to one side, but it's starting to lift up a little bit.
Marisha: I try to balance it as much as I can.
Matt: So you're slowing the process. Slowing it.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Make my way to the orb. Rip it out.
Matt: The ship is also slowly moving behind the other ship, as it's no longer maintaining speed. All right, so what are you doing?
Travis: I'm trying to make it to the orb that he was too weak to pull out--
Matt: Strength check.
Taliesin: I hope you pull something in your knee.
Travis: Hah! 25.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Matt: (popping sound)
Travis: I got it! Throw it in the water?
Taliesin: No! Let's keep it, let's bring it to the other ship.
Marisha: Put it in the Bag of Holding, Grog.
Travis: In the Bag of Holding.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: And I run, and I try and jump back to the other boat.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: I'm not gonna make it, but--
Laura: You might.
Liam: You might.
Travis: 23.
Matt: Five, ten, 15, 20... You catch the edge and are dangling on the side of the ship as your fingers are right there.
Liam: Looney Tunes!
Travis: (breathing hard) I'm good.
Sam: You could have flown.
Travis: I swallowed the coin.
Matt: Percival, water is now starting to spill in underneath you, and you're now about knee-deep inside, and everything's-- all the papers that you haven't already grabbed are soaked and floating up at the top.
Taliesin: I'm gonna run out. There's-- oh, man. I don't hear anything coming from down below, do I?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Did you ever hear that I wanted to go help Percy investigate, was I able to do that?
Marisha: Please tell me I didn't kill someone innocent again.
Matt: Yeah, you could fly over. Because you're behind him. As you rush in to help him, he has a couple armfuls of things, the room is now about knee-high with water and is tilting heavily to this side, and there's just floating bits of paper and soaked books and pieces of broken wood and furniture-- the room is utter chaos.
Laura: Anything interesting?
Taliesin: Yeah, I don't know. Hold on. I'm gonna listen for it.
Marisha: Hopefully no innocent people.
Taliesin: Perception check.
Sam: (muffled) Help me, I'm an orphan!
Taliesin: You're terrible. 17.
Matt: 17? You take a listen. Through all the splashing of water, the sound of wood creaking, and the ocean outside, you don't hear anything.
Laura: What are you listening for?
Taliesin: I show the keys. I'm worried there's a cage down there. I still have the spider boots, so I'm holding on.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can I hear anything with my elven ears?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: You've got an elven perception check.
Liam: They're taking the hobbits to Isengard.
Laura: What do your elf eyes see? Oh, nothing.
Liam: It was a one.
Laura: It was a one.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You go down and listen, and as soon as you do the water splashes up into your ear, and you get a bunch of salt water in the ear canal. Up in your nose a bit. You're like, ugh.
Laura: That was awful. We should get out.
Taliesin: I'm gonna hand her a bunch of stuff, including some of my things, and be back-- I'm gonna try and see if I can just--
Matt: Spider-boot down.
Taliesin: Spider-boot and see if I can hold my breath and look.
Laura: Don't drown, Percival.
Taliesin: I'm gonna grab, and try and use the lenses on my mask to even get a clear shot of what's under there.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I'm just trying to visualize with the last ten minutes that I have of Control Water to clear the bottom of this passage.
Matt: So you can do that. You can prevent, slowing the sinking, to part water.
Marisha: The rushing-in, that's what I want to do. I wanna part right where Percy's heading.
Matt: Okay. As you do that, the ship begins to list even further back and at an angle, and you watch as the front of it comes upward, and everything on the ship begins to slide past--
Travis: Yes!
Matt: -- in the direction of Keyleth and Vax.
Marisha: Sorry, physics.
Liam: Get off!
Matt: Can I have you both make dexterity saving throws, if you could.
Marisha: What, me too?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Jesus F. Christ.
Matt: A bunch of barrels just (rolling sound) in your direction.
Marisha: Oh, that's not too bad. Just straight dex saving throw. Plus five.
Liam: Natural 20.
Marisha: What did I roll? 16.
Matt: Okay, yeah, you both manage to just sidestep out of the way as they tumble past and splash into the water below.
Taliesin: Get out of here, you two!
Matt: You're starting to lose your footing a little bit. You probably have one more round before you just start sliding off the edge.
Liam: Let's go, man!
Marisha: Quick, quick, quick!
Taliesin: I'm fine. Vex is here, you two leave.
Matt: Percival. Perception check, as the water separates in the room.
Taliesin: Yeah. That's what I'm hoping for.
Marisha: Aw, you rolled a 19!
Taliesin: That's 26.
Matt: Okay. As you push down into the chamber with the walls of the water to the sides-- as you look down, and most of the furniture that was thrust up out of this area is cleared out. You do see two cages in the far back, one of which is empty. The other one does seem to have some sort of humanoid inside.
Taliesin: I'm going for it.
Marisha: Come on.
Matt: Okay. You rush up to the cage, and you look inside and you can already see what looks to be a slumped-over humanoid. You see no features, and there's no light down here, and your human eyes don't make out a lot of detail. The fact that you rolled so high-- it's only the little bit of light comes down here that's reflecting around.
Laura: Shit.
Taliesin: I've already got the keys in my hand and I'm just going to start going for it.
Matt: First key, nothing. Second key, nothing. Third key, noth-- (creaking sounds)
Sam: Cut the red wire!
Matt: Water begins to pour in from another side, and the ship itself is pulling back. I want you to go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Marisha: Come on, Percy. Come on.
Taliesin: I'm going to choose to use a Resolve. That's a save, isn't it?
Matt: That's for a saving throw.
Taliesin: God damn it.
Travis: Why didn't you roll the snitch?
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: A natural one. You start getting the keys in, and there's probably a good 15 or 16 or so keys on here, and you get through about six of them before the ship itself has gone into a fall, and the cages begin to slide--
Taliesin: Okay, I'm rolling. There's someone in there, but I can't get it! And I'm going to spider-climb on the upside, on the wrong side of the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out.
Liam: Was he under water, or was the water--
Matt: The water is being parted by Keyleth, currently.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: The cage is beginning to slide now, towards the back of the ship.
Taliesin: I don't know what to do. And I'm running out, I don't know what else to do.
Matt: Okay, so.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: There's someone in a cage. I don't know what to do!
Liam: I'll fly at that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Are you going? I'm gonna try whatever last bit of Control Water I have to try and part and calm the waters where Vax is going, and I say, go Vax, go!
Matt: Okay, so you just fly in?
Liam: If there's a cage, I'll go to it.
Matt: As you rush down inside, you watch as these two large, heavy cages are tumbling in your direction. An empty one slams just past you, and the other one slams into that, itself turning up a bit, and something inside slumps to the side of the bars.
Marisha: I'm trying to calm the water as much as I can.
Liam: Can I even see the lock or where the keys were?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: All right.
Matt: The keys you do not have. Percy has--
Taliesin: I have the keys, but none of them were working.
Liam: That's a 21.
Matt: 21. You manage to, as you leap up using your wings in little bursts-- this is a small, enclosed space, you can't use too much of the air to fly. In what little bit of parting of the water's being done, you catch up and climb onto the top, and you can see the cage has turned on its side, and the doorway is on the top. So you can see the actual lock.
Liam: All right. While I'm hasted, do I have an action left to get up there and pick it?
Matt: I'd say yeah.
Liam: Yeah? Okay.
Laura: Go, go, go!
Marisha: Go, go, go!
Liam: 32.
Matt: You reach out and pull out your picks, and as you look up-- Keyleth, at this point you're parting the water, but the ship is now sinking, and you are-- you're sliding off.
Taliesin: I grab. Can I make a jump to grab?
Matt: You can. Go ahead and make a dexterity check.
Marisha: And I'm just holding concentration, hoping someone catches me.
Taliesin: My dexterity-- save or check?
Matt: Either.
Taliesin: They're both the same. It doesn't matter.
Marisha: That's good, that's good.
Taliesin: 22.
Matt: Just catch Keyleth as she's about to slide off the edge, and you hold her there. Now, I will not require a concentration check from you, however, you're about to both go under water.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: You're holding her at the edge of the ship. You get the door open. It slams over on the side. And looking down inside, you can see what appears to be a slumped-over, soggy mess of a person. Unconscious.
Liam: Okay, can I keep going here, or--
Matt: Yeah. Grab them, pull them up, fireman's carry--
Liam: And then just try to slowly, messily float him up and out of here.
Laura: I want to go help if I can.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah, there's not much room for flight, it's more like--
Liam: All right, so pull.
Matt: -- leaping through, as you make your way there. You just get up onto the edge as the water goes past both Percy and Keyleth. You guys, your faces just (splash) beneath the ocean water.
Marisha: Yeah!
Liam: I shout out, Twinnie!
Laura: I help, I help, I help.
Matt: You rush down from the broom. He goes and flings the person over your lap, and you take up on the rest of the ship as the boat now is completely submerged. You watch the tip of it just (splash) beneath the water. Bubbling the water up around as--
Marisha: I drop Control Water, switch back to my Alter Self, grab Percy, head back to the boat.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: While this is going on, I'm asking Captain Adella's crew for towels. Could I get a towel? Or some sort of-- I'm really wet, here.
Matt: They're all on the edge of the ship, watching this happen. With one in the crow's nest, keeping an eye out. And they're not paying any attention to you.
Sam: I'm just worried that this will rust if I don't get it dry soon, so if I could get some towels, or maybe someone to fan it off, that would be great. Thank you.
Matt: All right. No response, but you are eager to repeat your question. As you make your way over, Keyleth, you pull Percival-- because both of you guys sink quite a bit below with the ship. As soon as it goes under, it goes under fast, and as soon as you glance up to watch that Vax makes his way out, and you can just see over the surface, you relieve that to start swimming up, and both the two of you-- you release your boots, and begin to make your way to the surface. It takes a moment, and you just get to the cusp of what you can hold your breath, before you both break the surface. Percy takes a deep breath, and you guys eventually swim your way over towards the edge of the boat. The fog, by the way, has begun to dissipate now, and has been slowly doing so since your removal of the orb from the edge.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: As you guys all manage to make your way back onto the surface of the ship, waterlogged and tired, we're going to take a break for the restroom.
Travis: Nice! A fight at sea!
Marisha: A fight at sea!
Travis: We made it off the Titanic!
Taliesin: I fell off a boat.
Liam: This is stupid, Rose! This is stupid!
Travis: This is stupid, why would you do that?
Marisha: Like Battleship, but better.
Matt: So we'll be back here in a few minutes. We do have a Wyrmwood giveaway for you guys in the chat room. Be active in the chat room, just you have to use the phrase 'Wyrmwood', w-y-r-m-w-o-o-d,  in the chat room, once they initiate the actual contest, and we'll come back from the break with the winner. So we'll see you here in a few minutes, guys.
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Critical Role! First off, thank you again to our evening's sponsor, Tor Books!
All: Tor Books!
Matt: For coming out and sponsoring this episode, make sure to check out A Conjuring of Light, the conclusion to the Shades of Magic series is now available. Also, we had a contest in the chat for this fantastic mahogany dice vault by Wyrmwood, the winner is Terrythesortofgamer. (all cheer)
Matt: Congratulations, Terry, we're gonna go ahead and get this signed and shipped out to you ASAP. Thank you all for entering, we'll have more giveaways in future episodes as well as Talks Machina on Tuesday with Brian Foster. Anyway, let's bring it back in.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: So, having returned to the ship, the fog lifted, and the path before you now clear, the rest of the open, cloudless sky before you, you continued ahead in the southwestern direction towards the Islands of Anamn, which is where Vesrah exists--
Laura: But I wanted to see the prisoner--
Marisha: Yeah, the prisoner.
Laura: -- are they okay? I mean, did I check them out while I was--
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: We're getting to that right now.
Marisha: Let's bring 'em back.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Fuckin', just cool your jets.
Marisha: We wanna talk to him.
Laura: Well, I mean, I had him on my lap as I was flying back. I wanted to make sure they were okay.
Matt: Right, so you come back to the-- as you bring the prisoner down, you lay him down-- and it is a man, early, mid- thirties-ish, maybe looks grizzled, kind of a half beard growing in--
Travis: Kill him.
Matt: -- he is drowned at the moment.
Laura: (gasps)
Sam: Oh, he's dead?
Matt: He's not breathing, he is waterlogged, and even at a quick glance, you can see he has scars all over his body--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: -- his clothes are tattered--
Marisha: Do I have any residual Control Water left? Yeah?
Matt: I'd say yeah, you're still concentrating--
Laura: I roll him on his side.
Marisha: Can I see if I can pull any water out of his lungs?
Matt: You know what? Make a wisdom check.
Liam: Out come the lungs.
Laura: (vomit noise) And he's dead. Dead dead.
Marisha: That's good! Just straight wisdom?
Liam: He's inside out.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Straight wisdom?
Travis: What is dead may never die!
Marisha: 21.
Laura: Oh no, you keep scooching back.
Matt: 21!
Marisha: Just straight wisdom?
Liam: What the heck, Laura.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So you get down on the low, and you reach out and grab the shoulder, and using the last moments of your Control Water spell, you focus and begin to just siphon the water out of the lungs, and immediately the body kind of convulses, the throat opens up from the outside, and you can see the water just project outward as the chest pushes inward, expelling the rest of the liquid from the lungs. Immediately, (coughs).
Marisha: Vax. Help.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
Liam: I do pat, pat, pat, except I cast Lay on Hands when I do it.
Laura: Yeah, well, I cast Cure Wounds while that happens, so go fuck yourself.
Liam: Seems oddly competitive at this moment, where we're saving a man's life, but all right.
Matt: What last murmurs of this man's life that remained as he began to fade to the drowning, you both manage to just bring him back from the cusp of death, and coughing profusely over the next 30 or so seconds, turning onto his stomach and gathering himself, taking breaths, spitting out whatever seawater still remains in his lungs, he looks back up at you all, and you can see he has a ragged, mouse-brown hair on top, and it's shorter on the sides around the ear, rather large ears, kind of square jaw but very scrawny, and once again from the tattered clothes and scars all over his body, some fresh, some old, looks like he's undergone a rough recent weeks--
Laura: I feel like we're finding Percy all over again.
Marisha: No shit.
Matt: Kinda looks up at everyone. "Wh-- Where am I?"
Laura: On a boat!
Taliesin: Different boat. Ship.
Liam: Our boat.
Matt: "What do you want?"
Laura: How long have you been in that cell?
Matt: "Who are you?"
Marisha: Sorry.
Laura: We're your saviors.
Matt: He leans back, falls onto his palms a bit, and is just kinda laying back, too exhausted to move away, but trying to just move back a bit.
Laura: Can I insight check him and make sure? I just don't trust anyone.
Matt: Sure. Insight check.
Laura: Ooh, natural 20. Wow wow wow.
Sam: He's a demon.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Liam: It's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Laura: Oh it is, it's Hotis, it's Hotis!
Marisha: Oh, I don't wanna fight Hotis on the ocean.
Sam: Guys, feel free to keep--
Marisha: What you got? What do you got, Grog?
Matt: Shove off, Travis.
Sam: Keep tweeting those pick-up lines to @TorBooks. They like 'em. I do, anyway.
Liam: Guys, I'm gonna make a Tor Books run, does anybody want anything?
Matt: Curse you, Travis.
Sam: Grande fantasy novel?
Laura: Don't worry.
Matt: (coughs)
Laura: Your captors have been defeated.
Matt: "Well that's good, eh?"
Laura: You're safe. What's your name?
Matt: He leans forward, sits up and looks at you. He seems to soften a little bit, though he's still guarded. "Thenton Groose. First Mate of the ship Tempest Fang. Yeah."
Laura: Tempest Fang?
Matt: "Tempest Fang. Yeah. It was taken by a bunch of bastards, kept me in that cage for a few weeks."
Laura: Weeks.
Marisha: Tempest Fang-- where do you hail from?
Matt: "Who wants to know?"
Marisha: Keyleth, of the Air Ashari.
Matt: "From around."
Marisha: From around?
Matt: "I'm a businessman of the seas."
Marisha: Not the sailor type, then?
Matt: "Sail a bit."
Marisha: What were you doing on the Ozmit Sea?
Matt: "Making a shipment across to Emon from Issylra, and this group of thugs decided to go ahead and ransack us from the side. Took our ship down and most of the crew. Kept a few of us alive underneath. Seems like I was the one who lasted the longest."
Marisha: From Emon to where?
Liam: From Issylra to Emon.
Matt: "From Issylra."
Marisha: Oh, from Issylra.
Liam: What was your cargo?
Matt: He looks at you for a second, reads you up and down as you step into the conversation. "General goods. Few fancy textiles--"
Liam: Insight check.
Matt: "Some silks, some furs."
Taliesin: Insight.
Matt: Insight check.
Liam: 18.
Taliesin: 19.
Laura: Ooh.
Sam: Oh boy!
Laura: Again, again!
Sam: Lots of whispers, guys.
Liam: Just come sit with us.
Marisha: All the whispers.
Laura: Oh, but do you just wanna hang out over here? 'Cause Travis is just gonna fuck with your shit again.
Sam: Hey, in the future-- Travis, what do you think about this-- don't shake your butt.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: That's disgusting.
Marisha: Get it, Levi's, yeah.
Sam: What if we-- here's my pitch. What if we have two tin cans and a string that just goes to Matt, and we can do like one of these things.
Matt: That's a great idea.
Sam: Ah! Ah!
Laura: That would be so cool.
Matt: "Yeah, I'm just-- I'm glad you came along."
Taliesin: Tell me, friend. Why did they keep you alive?
Matt: "That's a good question."
Taliesin: It is.
Matt: "I don't fucking know."
Taliesin: What did they ask you?
Laura: Can we get some food?
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Matt: Immediately his eyes widen--
Laura: I was talking back to Captain Adella or one of the crewmates. Not you, Grog.
Matt: As soon as you do that, Captain Adella goes, "Ah, I don't get food. You get food!" And one of the other crewmates, "Oh, oh right." And he immediately jumps down below the deck.
Sam: I'm gluten-free!
Liam: Well, we saved your life, how else can we help you, friend?
Matt: "Oh, just drop me off at the nearest port you get to, please."
Taliesin: That's going to be a while.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: "That's fine. That's fine."
Marisha: Have you sailed frequently before? What was your exact duty on this ship?
Laura: First Mate?
Marisha: Oh. Right. He already said that. So, you sail a lot.
Matt: "A fair bit, yeah."
Marisha: Yeah.
Taliesin: Any tattoos on him?
Matt: Yeah, actually, a handful visibly.
Taliesin: Any I'd recognize? I was on a boat for quite a while, as well.
Matt: Right.
Taliesin: It was a long time ago.
Matt: Make a history check.
Taliesin: All right. Let's say 18.
Matt: 18? Okay. None of the symbols you recognize, necessarily, however, the arrangement of them-- the placement of them and the general design are not used as-- there's tattoos you could see they're decoration, there're tattoos you could see that are meant as-- they mean something to the person. These tattoos and their placement seems intentionally to intimidate.
Taliesin: Huh. Okay.
Laura: Was he a pirate?
Travis: Mr. Theton Groove, is anyone looking for you right now?
Matt: "I don't think so, my crew went down with the ship."
Taliesin: What was your captain's name?
Matt: He kind of looks over at you, "Wha-- what-- why--"
Taliesin: I was just curious how quickly you'd answer it. It's fine. Carry on. You will be getting food, don't worry, this is not us being threatening, we're just... it's odd finding a man in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled with awful people. That alone makes us like you, but you are a bit weird.
Marisha: That's true. That's all true.
Taliesin: It is true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Forgive us, we have to be a bit wary.
Marisha: We've seen a lot.
Matt: "No, no, that's--"
Taliesin: We don't mind if you're disreputable, we just would like to know if you're our kind of disreputable.
Sam: If I may, new companions.
Travis: Oh god.
Sam: When my father would have--
Taliesin: Oh boy, okay.
Sam: -- sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate, he had an employee named The Dog who was a large man, who would come and just squeeze them until they talked. Why don't we just do that here? It seems like it would be much quicker than talking in circles like this.
Marisha: Do you have The Dog with you?
Sam: Well, we have this guy, who's pretty big--
Marisha: Oh.
Sam: -- and I bet he could squeeze--
Travis: I mean, I second that method, but I'm just seeing if anybody else--
Taliesin: I feel like that's deeply premature.
Travis: It's deeply immature. I would never do something like that.
Taliesin: Immature indeed.
Sam: Well, all right.
Laura: Plus he's so frail right now, I'm afraid Grog would just break him in half.
Travis: Probably.
Matt: He is noticeably looking nervously back and forth between Taryon and Grog, and--
Travis: I mean, after all, we saved your life, right? You wouldn't be (yells) hiding nothing, would you?
Matt: "No?"
Travis: See?
Marisha: Honestly, this is how we treat people we like.
Taliesin: God, that's also true.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: "Does anyone have any water?"
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: Oh yes.
Matt: "Fresh water? Oh, thank you." And he pulls it out and just starts drinking thirstily from it.
Marisha: All right. So we've cleared a few things, right? You seem untrustworthy, and broken, so therefore we like you. What else can we learn about you?
Matt: "I don't know what you're talking about. Look, I have business contacts, I can get you paid, just get me safe somewhere."
Taliesin: What sort of business contacts?
Matt: "The sort that I do business with, I told you. We deal in trade across the Ozmit."
Liam: Yeah, I mean, he's shifty as fuck, but it's no skin off my back, right?
Taliesin: No, not really.
Travis: We got any cages on this boat?
Taliesin: Oh, we're not-- we don't need that yet, where's he going to go?
Laura: Do I see any, like, Clasp markings on him at all?
Liam: That question might be great, but I think we're all right.
Matt: Nothing Clasp. Not really.
Travis: Gotta sleep at some point.
Matt: You kinda glance over and look at the middle of his shoulders and his shirt is kind of billowing, and torn. No symbol of the Clasp.
Laura: Those scars on your body. Were they from before you were captured, or after?
Matt: "Some-- both ways. The cages don't really protect very well."
Laura: What were they doing to you?
Matt: "They were just having fun, trying to get information about my company, and, you know. Being general pirate arseholes."
Travis: Sounds fun.
Marisha: And you're sure they were just pirates, yeah?
Matt: "Well, what else are they? Not the most pious men I've ever met."
Marisha: I don't know. I've never met a real pirate until just now.
Matt: At which point, one of the crewmen comes up with a small cluster of biscuits, and hands them over as he greedily reaches out like, "Oh!"
Marisha: Wait, one of the crewmen?
Taliesin: One of ours.
Marisha: One of ours?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I asked if they would bring him food.
Sam: We asked for food.
Matt: Adella just sent him for food.
Laura: I asked him to bring food.
Marisha: Why is he acting like he's starving?
Laura: Because he's been in a cage for two weeks. They didn't feed him very much.
Marisha: Oh, him, not our crewmate.
Travis: Holy shit.
Taliesin: Oh, okay, I--
Matt: The crewman brought food, and he reached out for it.
Marisha: Oh, sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Marisha: Sorry, we were confused. Sorry.
Matt: That's okay.
Liam: Can't you see everything around you? It's all here.
Travis: He brings up a plate of biscuits and hungrily starts eating.
Taliesin: Bangarang. Bangarang!
Marisha: I brought you biscuits! (eating sounds)
Taliesin: Congratulations, Peter.
Matt: The crewman's a dick, by the way. Just--
Marisha: Do you want these?
Matt: These are good biscuits, starving guy! To be fair, that is kinda your style.
Laura: Thenton, you will forgive us if we don't give you free rein of the ship while you're on here.
Matt: "Oh no, that's fine. That's fine. I mean, lock me up, whatever you need. Just get me back to land, please."
Laura: We'll promise not to poke you.
Matt: "That's appreciated."
Marisha: So, you said you travel the Ozmit Sea frequently, yeah?
Matt: "Yeah."
Marisha: Have you stumbled upon the island of the Vesrah? The Ashari people of this ocean?
Laura: (laughs) Of the Ashari.
Marisha: Of the Ashari (laughs).
Matt: He says, "If what you're referring to is the Islands of Anamn, we generally steer clear. Too many reefs."
Marisha: Of Omand? Alland?
Matt: Anamn. A-N-A-M-N.
Marisha: Almond?
Sam: Aman.
Taliesin: Joy.
Laura: A--
Marisha: Almond Joy.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Marisha: The Island--
Matt: A-N-A-M-N. Anamn.
Marisha: A-N-A-M-N.
Taliesin: Cluster.
Marisha: Anman. An-amn.
Travis: Well, we should introduce ourselves, at least.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: We are Vox Machina, a travelling group of acrobats, and--
Laura: Defeaters of dragons. No big deal.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: I do Van Damme splits, just as he finishes that sentence.
Laura: Trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do, when we say we're performers.
Marisha: And I light up my fire hands.
Travis: We do have two smarter members that are not here, Scanlan and Pike, but maybe you'll see them later if you stick with us long enough.
Laura: She's a sailor, too.
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: "Great."
Sam: Percival, am I misreading the scenario here? Can I please just pour acid on him until he talks to us? It seems like he's holding back, am I misreading, here?
Taliesin: No-- well, sort of-- not really-- sort of. It's complicated. We don't pour acid on people-- well, that's not true. No, that's a lie. We don't just pour acid on people, I feel like that's reasonable to say. We don't just pour acid--
Liam: Context. Context is key.
Taliesin: -- there's usually context involved. Things are complicated.
Sam: I am following your lead. But--
Taliesin: When it is time to pour the acid, we will undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front-- not yet--
Sam: Okay.
Taliesin: -- but you're good.
Sam: All right.
Liam: Hey, Captain.
Matt: Adella's behind you guys--
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: -- just kinda watching this whole thing with her arms crossed. One of her crewmates is currently at the helm.
Liam: I mean, the closest place to us right now is our desination, most likely, right? We're not gonna be able to dump this guy before we arrive, do you think?
Matt: "Yeah, no, we got maybe a day and a half travel 'til we reach the islands, so--"
Liam: Oy.
Laura: That's all right, he can stay on the boat.
Travis: We got an extra room for him?
Matt: "We got a-- we can throw him in the brig."
Taliesin: We can make the brig comfortable.
Laura: Yeah. We'll give him food. It's all right, right, Captain?
Matt: "We'll set some of-- one of our men on guard. All right! Pick him up. Throw him in the hole." Two of the crewmen come behind and pick him up, and kind of lean over the shoulder, like, "Ooh, thank you. Thank you very much, all of you." And he gets dragged off down below into the ship.
Liam: Byeee.
Marisha: Bye.
Laura: Captain, have you heard of the Tempest Fang?
Matt: "I've heard a thing or two."
Laura: Oh, really?
Matt: "Yeah."
Taliesin: Is it a pirating vessel?
Matt: "Yeah." (all laugh)
Matt: "I was gonna let him finish his whole diatribe before we had a conversation, but he's one of 18 working companies out of the archipelago, so--"
Travis: I believe it's arch-i-pelago.
Sam: Sea diarrhea!
Travis: Jot this down! (horn noises)
Liam: That was sudden!
Taliesin: And the tension is relieved.
Marisha: So, wait. If he works for one of 18 companies of the archipelago, that means the archipelago has pirates--
Laura: -- 17 other companies.
Marisha: 17 other pirate ships?
Matt: Pirate companies. It's a very-- some of them have alliances, some of them have very, very deep-rooted rivalries, and yeah.
Taliesin: The companies themselves have more than one ship, if I recall.
Matt: Some of them do, depending on the size.
Marisha: Wait, did we just sink one of the other 17 companies of the archipelago?
Travis: Is there any extensive damage to our ship? Are we still pretty good, other than the railing getting ripped off?
Matt: "Looking around, my crewmen tell me we're doing all right. So we'll do some repairs when we drop off at your location. Once you do your business, we'll have some time to go ahead and do a once-over of our ship."
Taliesin: I may have some charts that I stole from the other ship, as well.
Laura: Oh, yeah. I put them in the Bag of Colding for the time being. Pull it out.
Matt: Okay. Glancing about, a lot of them are maps of portions of the archipelago, the Hespit Archipelago, some are markings of various pirate headquarters, various places of parlay. A lot of them are waterlogged and soaked and damaged, but you can see elements that are-- a lot of them are hand-drawn notes in sections. The leather tube that you found, you pull it open, and there is a very, very immaculate piece of vellum paper that appears to have a number of glyphs scrawled across it.
Laura: Shit. Do we understand?
Sam: May I see that?
Taliesin: Sure.
Sam: I will Identify it.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: What? (all cheer)
Sam: Much easier this way.
Laura: That's great! You can Identify things? How many times a day can you do that?
Sam: I think all? Scroll of Programmed Illusion. Scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action to cast the sixth-level spell Programmed Illusion. If the spell is higher-level than the caster can use, they must make a spellcasting blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
Laura: Are you an arcane user?
Sam: I think I am.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Is this basically like the thing in Superman 2 where Lex Luthor's playing chess--
Travis: In the prison cell?
Matt: Kind of?
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: You have to look up the spell for the specifics, but yeah, it's got some interesting uses.
Sam: Are you arcane?
Laura: So basically it's you. You can use it.
Sam: Am I the only arcane?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a natural caster. You're the only arcane caster.
Laura: I mean, hold on to it in case we run into Scanlan again.
Travis: I am a powerful magician.
Laura: Or you can use it.
Travis: And with that, I take out the little gem thing that I pulled off the other ship.
Sam: Ooh! Should I Identify that?
Taliesin: You should Identify it.
Marisha: You should.
Sam: Can I, more than once a day?
Matt: Look at the ability. It's the spell-- I gotta look.
Sam: It's the Identify spell.
Matt: Yeah, it's a first-level spell.
Marisha: All the papers. All the papers in the world.
Taliesin: I imagine you're sitting here going--
Matt: It's a first-level spell, so as long as you have a first-level spell slot.
Sam: Oh.
Laura: Oh, I have a spyglass, I didn't even need to ask for Captain Adella's.
Sam: It's a ritual, though, is that--
Matt: Oh, yeah, if you can use it as a ritual, then it won't use a spell slot when you do that.
Marisha: You just do it, it just takes time.
Sam: All right. I will ritually Identify that. What's that all about?
Matt: That is a fog marker. It can be used by holding it a round, but it is generally used to create a 100-foot-wide fog cloud that lasts for an hour when used.
Sam: Do we know how to activate it?
Matt: To activate it, you have to spend a ten-minute period of time concentrating on the orb, and then as it gets moved, it carries the fog cloud with it and lasts for an hour.
Laura: That's cool.
Sam: Could be useful.
Laura: Super useful.
Taliesin: At the very least, it could be installed in the ship. They could have it as a possible--
Sam: Cloaking device?
Travis: You could put it in the guts of Dottie.
Sam: Doty.
Travis: Yep.
Laura: Deedee?
Marisha: Could you do that?
Taliesin: I don't know. It's not like he's hollow.
Marisha: In Doodie?
Sam: I mean, he's got a lot of stuff in there.
Travis: But that's not important, that stuff in there.
Liam: What kind of stuff?
Taliesin: Things.
Sam: You know.
Liam: No.
Sam: When you have two wheels and some ropes and it makes a pulley system--
Travis: Okay, no, just give it back to me, I'll put it back in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Thanks.
Taliesin: How big is the orb, out of curiosity?
Matt: The orb is maybe seven-inch diameter. It's about that big.
Taliesin: All right.
Marisha: It's seven-inch--
Matt: Yeah, it's about that big.
Taliesin: Interesting. All right.
Matt: So the ship is still progressing in that direction.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check on it? On the orb?
Matt: To? What do you want to do with the nature check?
Sam: To see if it smells like nature.
Marisha: Did it come from any Water Ashari, or anything like that? (all laugh)
Travis: What?
Matt: Roll a nature check.
Sam: Are you my brother? Are you my brother? (all laugh)
Marisha: 14?
Matt: It looks like a magic item.
Marisha: That's awesome. That's cool.
Taliesin: Does it have smoke inside when you turn it?
Matt: Yeah, when you turn it--
Taliesin: Like those weird balls filled with weird sand--
Matt: Yeah, actually, it kinda looks like that. As you shift it, it swirls on the inside. It causes the air-- intense condensation that eventually drips from the outside of it when it's activated.
Laura: Cool.
Marisha: (laughs) Outlook cloudy.
Matt: All right. So as everything rests down in the ship you can use, you have about a day and a half travel until you're supposed to reach the islands.
Travis: Can I post up outside of the brig where stabbed-in-the-body McGee is sleeping?
Matt: Yeah. And as he--
Travis: I'll forego my room. I just want to sleep sitting up.
Liam: Do we have rooms? I thought it was like Amex City on this--
Laura: No, we have rooms. But they're combined.
Matt: Yeah, they're clustered, you have many people per room. They're like bunks. So yeah, you post outside of the brig. As evening comes, the night passes. Is there anything you want to do? You just rest for the night?
Travis: Yeah, just keep the other guard company.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Just to give him a little expert help.
Taliesin: We've been tinkering on the ship, so.
Matt: What have you been tinkering?
Sam: Science-bro stuff.
Taliesin: Science-bro stuff. Do we have to tell you what it is?
Matt: To tinker it, so I can give you a DC, yeah.
Taliesin: So he's got this really cool--
Matt: "We tinkered something really cool. Did it work?" Sure, it succeeds. "We built Voltron."
Taliesin: You were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break, so I didn't know if this was a thing.
Sam: So, using one of the opals from my Helm of whatever, Brilliance, he wanted to craft a housing for it--
Taliesin: So I've built a couple housings for these opals. So, you pop the opal in, and it will allow it to create either a concentrated beam--
Sam: Spotlight.
Taliesin: Spotlight, basically, like a little flashlight, a radiant beam like a torch--
Marisha: Floodlight.
Taliesin: Like a floodlight, or while it's on spotlight, it's got a little railroad thing, it's got a little slot that will go in and give me a little bit of a red vibe, so we can have a low-light red light, and I'm also going to make a little clip so I can stick it on my gun, so I can have a little spotlight on my gun when we're going through a--
Liam: It also ensures you cannot get a prom date.
Taliesin: Hey, I'm doing okay, just saying. Percy doing okay.
Laura: I don't know, you've been tinkering a lot lately.
Matt: Okay, so that's doable. The opal doesn't perpetually glow--
Sam: Yeah, it lasts for an hour. Is that something we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour, like a battery, or is it just an hour, it's off--
Taliesin: And then we have to pop a new opal in.
Matt: Generally, you have to pop a new opal in.
Sam: Okay, no problem.
Taliesin: But you crack the opal, you put it in, it's like one hour of either flashlight, and then a little blinder to turn it on and off-- it's basically like a little train lantern.
Marisha: I was gonna say, like an old-school lighthouse.
Matt: Go ahead and roll a tinker check.
Taliesin: Doing this together?
Sam: Can I help him?
Matt: Yes, you would be giving him advantage as you attempt to do that. So you just roll it twice, Percy.
Taliesin: That was pretty good.
Sam: Did we get two 16s?
Taliesin: I got a 19.
Sam: Oh. I got a 16, but I get plus ten with my tinkerer's tools.
Taliesin: And mine's proficiency bonus and dex bonus on top of that 19? So that's 30.
Matt: Between the two of you guys, it is not an issue. Even with your limited materials, but your travel-tinkering capabilities-- you manage to deftly create this seamless, beautiful, you could sell it on the street.
Taliesin: So they can-- we may even make a little headband so they can pop it on.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Matt: (laughs) You guys are so cute. All right.
Marisha: I spend my evening reconnecting with Vax.
Matt: Okay. (all laugh)
Sam: The Hallmark card way of saying fucking.
Taliesin: Well, there goes our sponsor by Hallmark.
Matt: Yeah, thanks. Sorry, Hallmark.
Liam: It's a couple days-- we've been traveling for a while, right?
Matt: It was three days before this encounter, you have a day and a half left.
Liam: And has a day passed since that fight?
Laura: No.
Liam: No, this is that night?
Laura: This is that night, yeah.
Matt: This is the evening afterward.
Taliesin: I'll see if I get my charges back.
Marisha: I don't want to say I feel like I'm being replaced. You know? It's not that. It's just that Percy's kinda found a new friend.
Liam: You're losing some friends.
Taliesin: We're not hanging out all the time, we're being social.
Marisha: No, it's not that. I'm a good friend, right?
Liam: Oh hi, Percy.
Sam: I was going to say we're being social.
Taliesin: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You guys aren't there. I got distracted.
Matt: No, you guys are busy tinkering. You two are having a conversation where Vax is trying to console Keyleth's sudden friendship crisis.
Sam: Oh! Oh! You've got a little smudge right there.
Marisha: I mean, I know I can't--
Liam: You're missing your friendo time, I understand. (all laugh)
Marisha: I can't fulfill every need.
Liam: We hear them laughing from their room. (all laugh)
Taliesin: (snorts)
Matt: It is a very thin wall.
Travis: Yes, snorting.
Sam: And it was the metric system!
Sam: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Taliesin: (exaggerated laugh) (all laugh)
Marisha: I will never know what the metric system means. I don't know what that is.
Liam: They're both, you know, really special and--
Marisha: I'm still a good friend, right? I'm still a good friend?
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Am I a good friend?
Liam: Yeah. You're his best friend.
Marisha: All right.
Liam: Yeah, that's just new--
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: -- and those two have never met--
Marisha: No, I know.
Liam: -- a nerd as pure as the other.
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I know I told them to like, bond but now-- I mean (sighs). No, it's fine, it's fine. I'm cool. I'm cool.
Liam: You're more than cool.
Marisha: I've missed you.
Liam: (chuckles) Hi.
Marisha: Hi. (crying sounds) (all laugh)
Liam: I dry the tears away. Do you know--
Marisha: (tearfully) New guy and the new guy dynamic! And I don't know what the new guy's chemistry's like!
Liam: Do you know what's really cool, though? We're not on the verge of death every fucking day right now.
Marisha: (tearfully) That's true.
Liam: Yeah, you know, pluses and minuses.
Marisha: (tearfully) I'm glad the new guy's the worst of our problems. (all laugh)
Liam: Come here, you.
Marisha: (tearfully) I just love Percy so much.
Liam: I know, I know.
Matt: Aw.
Liam: I know.
Matt: An evening of consoling and the rest of you guys get your evening's rest, you outside the brig, uneventful.
Laura: I did want to talk, but that's okay.
Taliesin: I get that.
Laura: I can talk later.
Matt: Oh, did you want to talk? Go for it. Go for it.
Travis: (burps)
Liam: Go interrupt the party.
Laura: Yeah no, I was going to. TALIESIN; Well, I was going to say, you're welcome. We're finishing up, you're welcome in.
Marisha: (sobs)
Laura: Oh! Only when you're finishing up.
Travis: Ooh.
Taliesin: Well, I don't know when you were-- We obviously did it.
Sam: We built our--
Taliesin: I love that so much, it's so--
Travis: Wow, wow.
Liam: Did it?
Taliesin: Yeah, we put the whole thing together.
Liam: Put the whole thing?
Taliesin: The whole thing put together.
Matt: Phrasing.
Liam: Sure, yeah.
Marisha: Man, you're going for it. (all laugh)
Matt: You hear, as you guys are finishing up, you hear a knock at the door.
Travis: Cleaning up your--
Laura: Hello?
Taliesin: Yes! Come in.
Laura: Is it filled with smoke in here?
Marisha: (laughs)
Laura: Oh, hi Tary. I didn't see you.
Sam: We were welding.
Laura: Fun! Exciting! On a boat, even. Wow.
Taliesin: It's relatively safe.
Laura: So! What'd you make?
Taliesin: (sighs) Can I crack one?
Sam: Let's do it.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: Oh wait, we're using one?
Taliesin: We're using one.
Sam: All right, sure. Why not? It's 1000 gold, but okay, sure. (all laugh)
Taliesin: It's his father's money.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: (crack, dink) As he flicks the opal, it gives off a bright equivalent of the Light spell.
Laura: Oh.
Sam: Daylight.
Matt: Daylight! I'm sorry. This is--
Laura: Oh, shit.
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: The power of the sun.
Laura: That's powerful.
Matt: Basically, there's a sun in the room suddenly (crackle).
Taliesin: Wait.
Laura: Oh wow, you guys made a--
Matt: You're literally blinded for a moment.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: Your eyes just go (crackle).
Taliesin: We put it in the box, contain it.
Sam: Well, wait, open it just a little bit.
Taliesin: All right.
Sam: And then I'm gonna take my Helm of Brilliance and just put one of the diamonds up to the laser beam like light coming out so it makes like a dazzling light across the--
Laura: Wow.
Matt: It's a beautiful prism, which you're able to see in about 40 seconds. (all laugh)
Laura: It's a lot, it's just a lot of spots right now, but I'm sure.
Taliesin: Sorry.
Laura: Eventually. Oh! Pretty. Um, get out. You, not you. If you don't mind.
Sam: I don't at all.
Laura: I mean, of course you can stay--
Taliesin: Get out. It's okay.
Sam: I have a lot of dictation to do.
Taliesin: Out, out, out, out, out.
Laura: (quietly) Hi.
Taliesin: And I boot him out. Oh hi, thank god. And--
Laura: So, Percy.
Taliesin: Yes, dear?
Laura: I've been meaning to bring something up to you.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: At the risk of bringing up Scanlan again--
Taliesin: Oh.
Laura: Something I'd rather ignore.
Taliesin: Yes, me too.
Laura: When he left, he said something that caught my ear, which was that he heard. He heard Pike and his daughter, calling to him.
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: From the other side. Which is strange really, because when I was on the other side, I don't remember hearing anything. What about you?
Taliesin: Okay. I'm gonna sit down and open up a bottle.
Laura: Busting out the Courage again?
Taliesin: The Courage, I think, is long gone at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'm going for the Tear whiskey, fuck it Take a swing, and I pass.
Laura: Mm.
Taliesin: I was not in a good place, I was-- what I am choosing to describe as great motivation to live a long life. There was pain and sound and I've tried hard not to think about creating words to articulate it, but it was the feeling of being-- it was not pain without end, it felt like pain that would have an end because eventually there would be nothing left of me. I felt consumed. And yes, I heard. It was the only thing I heard. Yes. I know you well enough to know-- trying not to embarrass you, but--
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: -- yes.
Laura: I'm not embarrassed.
Taliesin: Well, I would've, honestly-- I would've never hoped otherwise. You're far too wonderful for an idiot.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: So (sighs), but I'm more hopeful. I'm not quite as fearful of whether-- I'm worrying less about what may happen when I die again and if I'm going to go back there.
Laura: Well, that's good. I would hope he's not waiting on the other side for you.
Taliesin: I hope not either, and--
Laura: What about when you were killed by Raishan?
Taliesin: That was quick. It was fine, but it was quick, so I'm not sure if that means anything yet. I've overthought this quite a bit and I don't know if you care to hear too many of my fears in this direction, but, I do think about it.
Laura: You can always tell me your fears, Percy.
Taliesin: Where do the people I kill go? I know you don't have an answer, I don't have an answer either, but--
Laura: I don't, I suppose it depends on them, doesn't it?
Taliesin: Does it? Or does it depend on me? Or does it now depend on this thing?
Laura: You don't think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were?
Taliesin: Maybe. I don't know, maybe I keep feeding it every time--
Laura: Oh no.
Taliesin: I don't quite know how to find out, other than I had a moment where I thought about shooting someone, bringing them back and asking them.
Laura: (gasps)
Taliesin: There was a moment I thought about shooting someone. Well, if it comes to it, it's something I've had in my back pocket as killing two birds with one stone.
Laura: Maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill.
Taliesin: That's my thought.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: And, I worry about what all of this is doing to us, but at the same time, I have such faith in-- I have such faith in you and Keyleth, and occasionally Grog, and occasionally your brother.
Laura: (laughs) Are you listening?
Taliesin: (laughs) But I'm starting to wonder if this is what all those heroes I read about when I was young, if this is what they felt, is just a lot of getting very comfortable with not knowing and being nervous and wondering if you're really just the villain of someone else's story.
Laura: I'm sure that's how they feel. No one's ever sure they're doing the right thing.
Taliesin: But I did hear you, sorry to-- I did hear you and sorry that I didn't say.
Laura: No, it's all right. Takes the pressure off, really, knowing that you know.
Taliesin: I treasure every minute, and you remind me to not be so serious.
Laura: Yes. So serious.
Taliesin: I'm not saying that you're not serious but-- (sighs)
Laura: (exasperated voice) You can go play with Tary some more if you like.
Taliesin: I'm done with Tary for the evening.
Laura: Great! Then you can play with me! (all laugh)
Taliesin: And crossing the whiskey off the inventory.
Matt: Off the-- yeah.
Taliesin: (laughs)
Matt: All right, as the evening--
Travis: Amazing.
Matt: -- the evening comes to a close, the next day's journey is met with a coming cloudfront, does not appear to be storm-bearing clouds but the clear skies seem to have come to an end.
Marisha: I'm restless in all of my night's sleep as we get closer.
Matt: Mm-hm. As the next day comes to a close, the sun setting, you hear a call from the top of the crow's nest that shouts out, "Land ho!"
Laura: We go running up.
Matt: You guys all catch up and you can see--
Liam: (quietly) You got this.
Marisha: (groans)
Matt: -- just as the last bit of sunlit glow behind the clouds begins to fade into darkness, you see ahead the gentle shape of islands just breaking the horizon ahead, and one by one, little lights (click click click) coming on.
Marisha: I rush to the bow of the ship.
Matt: As you come up to the bow of the ship, you can see at this point now, Captain Adella is starting to shout off to the side, "Keep it all high!" and is currently moving around and you see there are three guys at the front who all have lanterns out and they're watching the water below and they're shouting out, "Five to the right!" and they're giving different degrees and she's navigating through what looks to be a channel of reefs, as you glance over the edge. And you can see there are pathways here, but it looks like a lot of this water is very dangerous water and eventually you get to a point where one of them shouts, "Stop! Stop!" and they immediately throw down the sails and someone throws the anchor off the side and the ship (crunching) comes and slams to a halt as the anchor clicks and you can feel it grinding for a bit as it catches the edge of one of-- it looks like a reef below, but the ship eventually stops as you glance over, there maybe 15 feet away from hitting the edge of a reef. (grinding sound) It stops and the water (whistling) slowly comes to rest as the ship comes to a rest. Looking over the edge, you can see the water maybe about 20 or so feet down with what little bit of light the lanterns have put over, you can see the very top of various reef cliffs and hints of beach shelf beginning to rise up towards this cluster of almost like still fairy lights in the distance, unmoving. Captain Adella comes up to the edge of the ship and goes, "Well, that's about as far as we can get with this ship. My apologies."
Marisha: No, this is fantastic. And I run to the edge of the ship and I shoot a Daylight into the spell and throw a Create Water and make a rainbow over top of us.
Matt: Wow.
Marisha: (tch boom) Ooh.
Matt: So with that (pffff) the spray of vapor in the air of the night sky, the darkness ahead of you that was currently-- the clouds obscuring any sort of starlight, suddenly is showered with a spray of vibrant colors across the entire spectrum, as the vapor slowly cascades around each side of the ship. As it does, a few moments pass and you watch more lights spark open in the distance (puff puff puff puff puff) whatever the source is, you begin to get a clearer view and there you can just barely begin to see the edges of what appear to be a very, very faint outline of a number of buildings all springing up from the water itself.
Travis: (quietly) Oh shit.
Matt: The city is not on one of the islands, the city is in the center of them, there's a triangulation of these land masses and the city itself resides between all three.
Sam: (quietly) Wow.
Matt: Some of the guys in the front of the ship start taking small rowing boats and taking them up and latching them in and setting them off the side into the more shallow waters below.
Marisha: I run past all of them and just jump into the water, not gracefully like before and start swimming.
Matt: Make a perception check. (all groan)
Laura: Oh no.
Marisha: Perception check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: We're at a reef!
Liam: Don't face-plant on a reef!
Marisha: Fine. Ooh!
Taliesin: There is now!
Liam: I'm on a reef.
Marisha: Oh that's just a dexterity check?
Matt: No, perception.
Sam: Perception.
Marisha: Oh, perception. 28.
Matt: You run to the edge and right as you're about to leap, you look and realize there's relatively shallow reef in the direction you're about to leap, so you kinda turn and (laughs) go at an angle instead and (plop) into the water below.
Marisha: (nervous sounds)
Matt: A second, almost a second after you, the ship (cracks) hits the water below and they start throwing down the rope ladder and you guys are allowed to then step into the rowboat.
Laura: Broom.
Taliesin: Carpet?
Matt: You have the broom. Or carpet if you like?
Marisha: I just start--
Taliesin: I'm gonna get on the carpet and offer it to anybody who likes.
Marisha: Using my cantrips--
Travis: Well, I need the boat 'cause I'm heavy.
Taliesin: What about the boat?
Sam: I want to be on the flying carpet, 'cause that's amazing.
Laura: Trinket will get in a boat with Grog.
Liam: What are you doing?
Laura: No! Trinket's gonna be in my necklace.
Matt: All right. Trinket goes in the necklace.
Laura: Yeah, for a minute.
Liam: Hopping on behind my sister.
Matt: Okay, so your sister, you guys are taking the carpet--
Sam: Yes!
Matt: -- Grog, you're going in the boat?
Travis: I got my own rowboat.
Matt: (laughs)
Taliesin: With a robot. Robot in the--
Sam: Oh yeah! The robot is--
Travis: No. Dottie is not coming with me.
Taliesin: Dottie is coming with you.
Sam: Well, he can come on the--
Laura: No, he can't. It's too heavy. It's too heavy for the carpet.
Taliesin: Doty cannot come on the carpet.
Matt: It's too heavy to go on the carpet.
Sam: I have to stay behind with Doty.
Taliesin: Yeah well, have fun.
Travis: Yep, see you later.
Laura: Get him on a boat. Get on a boat, Tary.
Sam: Is there another rowboat for us?
Matt: They have other rowboats on the side, you can request another one.
Sam: I would like to request another rowboat for Doty.
Marisha: (laughing) A boat for Doty.
Matt: Okay, so as you guys begin making your way, roughly five minutes behind you, as you all are kinda moving forward together via carpet, flight, and her swimming, and Grog strongly pushing his way through, Tary's just impatiently waiting for them to get the other boat off the side of the ship and they're slowly lowering it down, kind of the ropes having to adjust as it goes and you're like (groans). (all laugh)
Travis: I see adventure over this way! Too bad you won't be there to see it!
Sam: I'm missing it, hurry up! (all laugh)
Matt: As you guys begin to approach, Keyleth, your feet eventually hit sand as opposed to treading water, and as you begin to walk up, the water comes past your waist, down to eventually your knees, and that is about as low as it goes.
Marisha: As far as it goes, yeah.
Matt: And looking out above you, you can see this beautiful lagoon that is completely submerged in about a foot, foot and a half of water for a good mile in all directions. And you can see dozens and dozens of these Grecian looking white and green marble structures that rise up out of the water. You can see a series of poles that stand up holding these lanterns that have all been magically set alight to give the city a sort of a glow. You see shapes moving, you see figures shifting out of these buildings and making their way in your direction, and as you're looking at this space in front of you and you guys begin to kind of meet up, you watch as a figure (whoosh) out of the water next to Keyleth. You glance to your left and look down and you see what appears to be a child, maybe about 13 years old, human-like, though his ears come to a bit of a finned appearance. You can see what looks to be gill slits to the side of the neck, and he looks up at you with kind of a tattered, long-stiffened piece of cloth tunic and shorts that end at the knee,and he kinda looks up at you and just kinda smiles with these very, very bright, orange-ish yellow eyes, "Hi."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. And I drop to my knees and drop down and--
Matt: (sploosh) You go face-down into the water.
Marisha: Gah! (heavy breathing)
Matt: Get up and (groans) push the water-- the hair back a bit.
Marisha: And bow again.
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: Okay. "Um... what are you doing?"
Marisha: Sorry, are you the leader-- are you the headmaster?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I am."
Marisha: Oh! Hi. Uh, Keyleth.
Matt: "Keyleth. " And he reaches out and grabs your hand. "Yulan."
Marisha: Yulan!
Matt: "Leader of the Water Ashari."
Sam: (laughs)
Marisha: I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. And I bow again, under the water.
Matt: (splash) Into the water again.
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: He shakes his head, you can see now he has these tossed medium-length dreadlocks that shake with his head as he turns side to side, (laughs) He looks up at the rest of you, "So! She yours?"
Laura: Mm. Mm-hm.
Taliesin: More or less.
Matt: "You bad people?"
Laura: Uh-uh.
Taliesin: Nah.
Travis: Not today.
Sam: We're just rowing up. What'd I miss?! Start over, start over! (pants)
Matt: "Is he a bad person?"
Laura: Nah.
Liam: Nah. He's all right.
Taliesin: He's workable.
Matt: "Okay. Well, come with me." And he reaches out and taps you on the shoulder, Keyleth.
Marisha: (gasp) It's just such an honor.
Matt: Come on.
Laura: Keyleth!
Marisha: What?
Matt: He grabs your hand and pulls you up out of the water, and starts running in towards the city, holding you behind him. Just kinda tugging you by the hand.
Laura: Oh, he has legs?
Matt: He does have legs.
Laura: Man!
Taliesin: And he does know how to use them.
Travis: Keyleth!
Sam: (laughs)
Matt: Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash...
Travis: Be cooler.
Marisha: Cooler. Cooler. (blows) And I let a little frost go from my breath.
Matt: (blows) Okay. Splash, splash, splash splash splash splash splash. He's just running through the water. You can see a number of people have now stepped out of the buildings as you guys approach. And each one of them-- all of their clothing ends at the knee. You can see that this entire society walks through and lives partially submerged. There is an ever-present water element to their day to day life.
Laura: They must have the pruniest feet!
Marisha: -- feet.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: I know, right?
Liam: (laughs)
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: That was amazing. I would live there in a second!
Taliesin: How did that happen just now? How did you just go there?
Laura: (laughs)
Matt: The sand is soft and still strangely warm beneath your feet, though the night has come. And even through the distant sparkles of light everywhere, this city-- a lot of the buildings seem hollow and open, like what walls that there are, there's large windows. It seems like everything has this very kind of open-air, free lifestyle to it. And as you begin to approach--
Marisha: As he's dragging me, I just start, like, rambling all the questions at once. I'm like, Aren't-- This is such a gorgeous city you have. Are you freshwater or saltwater? Do you have webbed feet? Does everyone have webbed feet? How many people can control water? Wow, look at that. Look at those. Is this fire that you use? Or is it all arcane?
Matt: He's not answering any of your questions, and you hear a voice shout out: "Yulan!"
Marisha: (gasps)
Matt: And the boy kinda stops and drops your hand and backs away with his hands kinda crossed behind his back, and he steps away, bowing his head a little bit and (splashing noise) away. The crowd-- and you can now see, all these different people, most of them appear to be human, elven, there are a handful of dwarves, a couple halflings, it's a spread of races here. You see two half-orcs that have these large tridents off to the side, and they're guarded but they're all deciding whether or not this is a welcoming circumstance, or a careful parlay. The voice that rang out, the crowd parts a little bit, and you watch as the water around you guys begins to spiral into these columns. Each one appears to be similar to the entity you saw rise onto the ship. A series of water elementals begin to rise out of the water, as some of the individuals in the crowd pull their hands together, and then you see four of them rise and begin to circle. Not closing in, but just keeping very close vigil around. And you realize at this point that, while the city is welcoming, they are also a carefully guarded people. The crowd parts, and you see stepping out, with the tiniest of splashes, a very tiny woman. Old, shriveled, most of her hair is gone and these thin wisps of white and gray, a wide oval-like head, the skin itself an olive yellow tint. Very wrinkled and pruny, the eyes are almost these tiny little black beads. Gnome, very old, with a long staff that's twice her height that just kinda with each step (squishing splash) kinda like a weird female Water Ashari Yoda. And just kinda steps forward through the water--
Marisha: Rad!
Matt: "Yulan, you are not to greet our guests! Now, you. What is your name?"
Marisha: Hi. (clears throat) Kaitiaki, I am Keyleth, daughter of Vilya and Korren of the Air Ashari, and I am here to complete my Aramente. I am--
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Kaitiaki. I am honored to be in your presence.
Matt: "I am Uvenda, Heart of the Tides here. I had my own Aramente, long ago. And I knew your mother who came for her Aramente, as well."
Marisha: You knew my mother?
Matt: "She came here for her own Aramente. And now you come to complete what she could not. So--"
Marisha: I'm-- I'm--
Matt: "-- you are welcome, Keyleth of the Zephra."
Marisha: I'm sorry. I'm-- sorry, that just means she visited the Earth, and the Fire, and the Water Ashari. She completed her Aramente.
Matt: "She did not, child."
Marisha: What hap-- She-- I-- Everywhere I've been, she's been. Why not?
Matt: "Come. Come. We shall speak, there is much to discuss, and it is growing cold out here, and you could probably all use a warm fire. So? See to our guests!" And the folks around go from their tense reverie and begin to approach and take, like just instinctually taking your belongings, and helping you unload. You guys (laughs) withdraw, and they back off as soon as they realize that wasn't part of the circumstance. But you are led deeper into this city, and there is a central temple that has multi-layers. Three floors with a number of spiral staircases on the outside of the structure that lead to it. Each floor is still very open and you get the sense that this whole city is built around the flow of ocean air and sea spray. And there is almost like a constant breeze that just blows through. And a lot of the buildings are rounded at the edges. The heavy waves and water that just come through here has-- you can see rounded and brought curvature to all the structures for as long as the city's been around. There are elements of shell-type shapes, there are bits of ocean inspiration to the architecture, it's a very interesting, alien, and beautiful place compared to where you've been before. You're led into this temple structure in the center of this city, you're brought to a series of what look almost like tree stumps, but they're made of a bright, bleached white, almost spongy material. And as you sit on them, food is brought to you, fish, fresh cooked platters. You guys are now being treated like honored guests, as you arrive. As you sit down, Keyleth, Uvenda, has a servant bring a much taller sponged stool than the ones you guys have, and it's set in front of you, and she uses her staff and (grunts) pole-vaults on top of it, and sits, crosses her legs, and sets the staff off to somebody and kinda leans down with her hands in front, her chin resting on them, her little beady gnomish eyes looking down at you. "So, Keyleth, the Aramente is not easy."
Marisha: I know.
Matt: "Do you know what this leg of your journey entails?"
Marisha: I mean, I've made it this far. In my heart, I feel like I'm almost complete, but I feel like you're about to tell me something different.
Matt: "You are near the completion of the Aramente, this is true, and through this, you will learn the strength of utilizing your own capabilities and those of your trusted allies. You will learn various ways of looking at the difficulties and challenges that are before you. And there are lessons as part of this, so listen carefully. For the final leg of your Aramente, we will wait 'til the morning sun comes to these waters, you and your compatriots will be brought down below the waves, below this city, to the Aerie of Torrent, where the Vesrah rift resides to the Water Elemental Plane. The Aerie is where we implant the lodestones that keep the village from sinking, and the rift size contained. The lodestones, unfortunately, do wane in power over time, so we must occasionally cross into the rift, and have our fastest Waverunners recover replacements within the Elemental Plane. The source of the lodestones, in which we have built and maintained this city. But the once-challenging path to these lodestones has now become deadly for all but our swiftest."
Marisha: Why?
Matt: "We would find these stones sparsely scattered throughout the plane, just beyond the rift, leaving us uncertain of their origin for as long as we've been here. For generations, they would just fall and sink to the bottom, or we'd scavenge them from the silt and sand below. However, this last generation of Waverunners have discovered them to be a product. Natural waste of a particular creature that resides within the boundless oceans of the plane. An ancient beast, once guided upon creation by the Titans that claimed this world their own before the gods came and gave light to our souls."
Marisha: What's it called?
Matt: "They are known in many languages, by many names, but the common tongue knows to them as the krakens."
Laura: (yells)
Marisha: (yells)
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: (excited hyperventilation)
Matt: "Humongous, tentacled beasts, long free of their servitude from their creators. One of these such krakens has taken to the waters near the rift, and made it its home on the other side. And this beast appears to have been producing the lodestones that we relied on for ages. This research, and information they've gathered, however, garnished the attention of this terrible fiend, and was accidentally led directly to the rift where it now nests, and feeds on the other creatures naturally drawn to the energy of the tear between the worlds. We now use the lodestones and our powers not only to control the merging of the planes at the rift, but to also prevent this monstrosity from crossing over into our world and tearing our city asunder. Your task--"
Marisha: So--
Matt: She puts a finger out to stop you. "--would be to descend into this Aerie of Torrent, enter the rift, and recover three of these lodestones, and return to us. That is all. Avoid the beast if possible, for to battle it is folly, and to kill it is to sink our city, and curse the rift, to eventually fade."
Marisha: So, don't kill it?
Laura: Do. Not. Kill. Got it.
Marisha: Don't kill the kraken. Right? Don't kill the kraken?
Travis: No, kill the kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Liam: Get kraken.
Sam: We can reason with it.
Marisha: Get three lodestones, bring it back, don't kill him because he is responsible for you guys not sinking into the ocean.
Laura: Because he makes the lodestones.
Sam: With his poop?
Liam: Poopstones.
Marisha: He makes the lodestones--
Laura: Basically.
Sam: Poops lodestones.
Marisha: -- with his droppings?
Matt: "Essentially, yes." (all laugh)
Marisha: All right.
Matt: "To use such base terms."
Marisha: All right. So he drops these lodestones at the base of the water plane.
Matt: "Yes. Often found within the vicinity of the rift, but such is the beast. Be quick, be careful, be stealthy, and return as soon as you have them."
Marisha: Do you have an example of these lodestones so that we know what we're looking for?
Matt: "We will show you at the Aerie tomorrow in the morning."
Marisha: All right. So this starts in the morn-- Which is exactly what you said. You totally said that, didn't you?
Matt: "Yes. Yes, I have."
Marisha: All right.
Laura: Is there something that helps those of us who don't breathe underwater breathe underwater?
Marisha: I can handle that.
Laura: Yes?
Marisha: I can handle that. So. What happened to my mother?
Matt: She swallows strongly. "Your mother was a brave woman, very much like you, now that I see you before me. Unsure of herself, and wishing to please, and not disappoint. And it's hard to ascertain but I fear it's perhaps that lack of confidence that may have caused her failure."
Marisha: Did she not make it out? Of the water plane?
Matt: "She brought her own companions, that she had found and brought with her along her path. Our guides brought her to the rift, and her companions did not survive. Your mother did not return, and we sent scouts to try and retrieve her body so she could be interred correctly, but we only found a leg."
Marisha: She's still alive. That means she's still alive.
Matt: "Hold onto that hope. Use it, and finish what she started. She lives through you at the very least. Hold that memory."
Marisha: I will hold on to it, but I hope you know that does not define me. I'm not her.
Matt: "Good. Then perhaps you have a chance."
Marisha: We'll complete your task. Thank you.
Matt: "You've come far, young Keyleth. I have faith that you will rise, and become the Voice of the Tempest. For now, we rest. Eat. Sleep. For tomorrow, you face the pet of the Titans." And that's where we'll leave tonight's session.
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: (scared panting)
Travis: We're gonna kill a kraken!
Marisha: No!
Liam: No!
Laura: No!
Marisha: Kill a kraken!
Sam: No, don't kill a kraken.
Marisha: Right, we're not gonna kill a kraken.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: We are going to not kill it.
Taliesin: We are going to irritate a kraken.
Laura: We are going to--
Taliesin: We are going to make it--
Travis: Holy shit!
Laura: -- We're going to steal some kraken's poop.
Travis: I have no idea what that means.
Marisha: We're gonna collect kraken droppings.
Travis: I don't know what a kraken is like in D&D, but I'm fucking stoked to find out.
Taliesin: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Marisha: We're gonna bring a bottle of Kraken.
Laura: (laughs)
Marisha: Oh, I'm so gonna bring a bottle of Kraken next game!
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: (excited shouting)
Taliesin: You know what else we're gonna do? We're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: We're not gonna finish it.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yeah, we're not gonna finish it.
Marisha: That's game, we do not finish it.
Matt: That's kind of perfect.
Laura: We're gonna drink most of it.
Liam: (chuckles)
Taliesin: We're gonna drink most of it, but we're not gonna kill the kraken.
Marisha: Except for like one-fourth of it.
Laura: Yeah. TALIESIN. Don't. 'Cause we don't kill the kraken.
Marisha: We let it live.
Liam: We're gonna give that thing some maylox. (proot fart sound)
Taliesin: Don't kill the kraken.
Travis: Nice job, Matt!
Matt: Nice job, you guys.
Travis: Nice C!
Taliesin: Good game. Good game.
Laura: C!
Matt: All right. We'll bring this up next week on Thursday for the last leg of Keyleth's Aramente--
Sam: Hey.
Matt: -- as the party might face a kraken!
Laura: Oh my goodness!
Matt: That'll be interesting.
Liam: One of 17.
Matt: (laughs)
Travis: Yo momma is the kraken.
Marisha: That's what I'm most afraid of!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: I've already thought about it.
Taliesin: Long John Silver!
Travis: Wow. No, no, no, no.
Marisha: That she's the full Long John Silver.
Taliesin: She's gonna go pirate, she's gonna have a patch and a beard--
Marisha: And a peg leg!
Taliesin: -- and a peg leg.
Marisha: She totally has a peg leg.
Laura: Ew.
Taliesin: And like a little cuttlefish instead of a instead of a parrot.
Marisha: (gasps)
Laura: Rad!
Marisha: My mom's a pirate!
Laura: Definitely.
Liam: (singing)
Taliesin: (joins singing)
Marisha: (joins singing)
Sam: That is not the key at all.
Travis: Oh god, get us out of here.
Taliesin: No.
Matt: All righty, guys. (all laugh)
Matt: We'll pick up next week on Thursday. (laughs) Thank you so much for watching. Thank you again, Tor Books, for sponsoring.
Sam: (incoherent background noise) Tor Books, toy boats, Tor Books.
Liam: Tor Books.
Matt: Wyrmwood for being awesome. We're gonna go ahead and rest. Oh, I forgot to mention. I will be on the Rollplay live anniversary game on Saturday. I'm actually flying up to Canada to go play with them in person. So-- (all cheer)
Matt: I'm gonna be jumping in for one episode of the Swan Song series.
Travis: Are you gonna play?
Matt: That will be fun. Yeah! I get to play!
Sam: In Canada?
Liam: In Canada?
Matt: Up in Canada, yeah.
Sam: Each d20 is actually worth 22 up there. (all laugh)
Taliesin: Is that where you have to roll backwards?
Sam: Yeah.
Taliesin: You roll backwards there?
Matt: Yeah, that's how it works.
Marisha: And, as always, don't forget to watch Talks Machina on Tuesday--
Laura: On Tuesday!
Matt: With Brian.
Marisha: With Brian Foster!
Matt: That will be fun.
Marisha: At 7pm.
Liam: Matt's always talking about his campaign up in Canada, I'm not sure if it's real or not. (all laugh)
Marisha: What are you talking about, guys?
Matt: It is real!
Marisha: This is fine.
Matt: It's real!
Laura: Totally real.
Marisha: This is great!
Matt: Anyway. Have a wonderful night, guys. Rest well. Laura, get up early.
Laura: I know!
Matt: I'm sorry. Is it Thursday yet?

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons, or are a little late on the draw when shouting the phrase out, Travis Willingham. (laughs) Anyway, before we get into tonight's episode, let's go ahead and jump into our announcements. Let's see here, we've got a new game called Injustice 2 that just came out.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you speak of?
Travis: Is that the shapes and pie-making game that you play in the kitchen bakery?
Marisha: It's like Cooking Mama.
Laura: I watched a video today of you and you fighting, which was pretty exciting.
Matt: Yeah, we have all the Flashes covered, I think.
Taliesin: All of the Flashes are on this show.
Laura: That's crazy.
Matt: So who do you guys play?
Taliesin: I play Barry Allen.
Liam: I play Reverse-Flash. What's his name?
Taliesin: Eobard Thawne.
Liam: Right.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Travis: I play Tim Garrick.
Taliesin: Jay Garrick.
Travis: Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a helmet.
Matt: It's pretty slick.
Travis: The one Flash I don't know, really.
Matt: Next Halloween, man. Just saying. I'd love a picture of you wearing that hat.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Ashley: Yes, please.
Matt: Please. It'll be great. And I play Deadshot. Yeah, check it out, it looks really good. They had us all do really intense facial motion capture which is even funnier, considering that my character wears a mask the whole time.
Travis: Did they really make you do that?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: With a mask?
Matt: Well, not with a mask on my face, but yeah.
Taliesin: That would've been even better.
Matt: I assume there'll be a DLC costume where he doesn't have a mask, or they just did it to fuck with me, which I respect either way.
Travis: They're in the booth, going (whispers) we're not getting any of this!
Taliesin: Don't tell him! Let it roll.
Travis: Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead; it's fine.
Laura: Those bright lights are headache-inducing, yeah.
Matt: So check it out. It's out now, it's fun! What I've seen of it looks actually really cool.
Taliesin: I've played a little; it's fun.
Matt: They got their RPG in my fighting game, and that's right up my alley. All right, also, because it's coming up real fast, reminder, MomoCon, May 25th to the 28th. MoMocon! Taliesin, Marisha, myself, and Brian W. Foster are going to be there for a Talks Machina panel, as well as other events throughout the weekend, so look forward to seeing you there in Atlanta, Georgia, weekend after this one. Also, I will be at A-Kon once again, June 8th to the 11th in Fort Worth, Texas. Come say hello to me there. And then, remember that Talks Machina is live on Tuesdays at 7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha. The submission email has changed, so to submit your gif and/or fanart of the week, use submit@talksmachina.com. So that is submit, submit! One submit, not two, that's just my psychosis. Submit@talksmachina.com. Yes. Anything else anyone wants to talk about, are we good? Move on to the game for the night.
Laura: Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and it's actually a really freaking cool game.
Travis: It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do you have to get the gun for it?
Laura: You shoot things with a gun, and it was a really cool script and stuff. I liked the story a lot.
Liam: That's not how guns work.
Taliesin: Are we talking about next week?
Marisha: Are we talking about next week?
Matt: Oh, yeah, we should say that, too.
Marisha: That's a big one.
Matt: That wasn't on the list. So yeah. So we're missing two cast members next week.
Travis: Guess who's not here.
Matt: What? That's terrible.
Ashley: Hey!
Matt: But given the circumstance, instead, we're going to have a non-numbered episode next week, instead it looks like we're going to throw in for a new, higher-level battle royale for those who will be here to see how some of these high-level abilities function.
Marisha: You won't be there to put my face in lava this time! I'll just have myself to do that.
Ashley: I know, you guys, I won't be there, so.
Travis: Will Friedle won the first one, she won the last one.
Laura: I've never done it.
Sam: I've never done it, either.
Laura: Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?
Matt: It's up to you; you get to choose.
Marisha: Are you going to bring back Scanlan?
Sam: All right, Taryon's going to die in like five seconds. (laughter)
Taliesin: So if we loot Tary's body, do we get all of his stuff?
Matt: It's not in canon.
Taliesin: No, even not in canon, in the game.
Matt: Oh, if you go to his body after he's dead, you can grab any of his shit to use it.
Taliesin: You are a loot drop, oh my god.
Matt: As long as it's not attunement, you can use it.
Laura: Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it?
Matt: I believe it is, yes.
Sam: Probably, yeah.
Laura: Too bad. But we can just steal all of his jewels just for the sake of it.
Matt: There you go. In the alternate universe version, you are just decked out.
Sam: Do I get Doty in the fight?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay. That helps.
Matt: And you'll be leveled up to their level.
Sam: And I'll be leveled up to their level?
Matt: For the battle royale, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we level up for that.
Matt: Anyway, that'll be next week. That pushes our hundredth episode to June 8th. And it looks like we're confirmed for June 1st for our next guest, I believe.
Sam: Yes. Yes, we are. We are confirmed for that. Are we announcing that?
Matt: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Sam: Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest, Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.
Marisha: My mother has never been so proud of me.
Laura: So, did we already say that because next week is a battle royale, that means our hundredth episode--
Matt: Is pushed to the 8th, yes.
Laura: Okay, you already said that? Was I busy rolling dice and talking?
Matt: You were. But thank you, Laura. Good looking out. I appreciate that. So yeah, I think that's all the major news, and given that, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello and welcome back, everybody. So last time where we left off, Vox Machina, upon working on their bakery, the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone, made a possible new hire who turned out to be a drow bounty hunter named K'rynn, who was sent here to acquire Taryon Darrington and bring him back home to the city of Deastok In Wildmount. You guys all, through a series of high-level magic scrying and transportation, managed to cut off this specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the city, and in doing so made an agreement to not slay her where she stood, and instead possibly make a transaction down the road. You guys then made your way into the city of Deastok to the Darrington Estate and were led up into the study of Howaardt Darrington, father of Taryon, in which you all discussed the reasons of why he was brought back, the current financial state of the family, and the intent to resolve and remedy long-standing sins of the father, through you standing up and doing your family duty, from his perspective. We left off as you guys had just finished that conversation. You've exited his study and were about to go about your business. Coming off the tension of the conversation, you closed behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of Howaardt's study. There you have Bertholt, who's standing off to the side, the dragonborn servant of the Darrington family, waiting patiently, and you all at this moment are at your own disposal. What do you wish to do?
Sam: Just before we move  the names that Dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?
Laura: Korshad.
Sam: Korshad?
Matt: Korshad, yes.
Travis: And how much was the debt? It was 260,000?
Sam: 230,000!
Matt: 230,000 gold debt.
Sam: But wait, wasn't there some other name, the little--
Travis: Lydia!
Matt: Lydia was who you are to be betrothed to, and the location was the Grumpy Lily.
Marisha: I was questioning myself, I was like there was no way something was called the Grumpy Lily.
Matt: Had a stroke while taking notes in D&D. Grumpy Lily!
Laura: The Many is who we want to speak to.
Taliesin: Just as something that happened, during that whole family conversation I was scanning the room and the bookshelves for anything interesting, anything out of sorts, anything out of place.
Matt: Make a retroactive perception check.
Sam: A retroactive perception check!
Taliesin: I didn't want to-- yeah, I didn't see shit. I just rolled a three; that's nothing.
Matt: Rightly so!
Sam: Retrograde! You know they always say that retrograde perception is 20/20?
Matt: What?
Taliesin: I appreciate what you were going for there.
Sam: Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he knows the location of my sister.
Matt: "Well, if you are looking for Maryanne, she's probably in her chambers."
Sam: All right, well, I mean I guess we can all walk to her room and knock on the door. It's a little weird, right?
Liam: You want to go talk to her and touch base with her first? You can introduce us to her after.
Sam: Sure. I'll lead them back downstairs to that main room that was all awful and terrible, right?
Matt: Well, it was just dark and cold and empty.
Sam: So I'll lead them down there. This was our playroom, maybe you should just wait here and I'll go talk to sis. I'll be right back.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is there like furniture to sit on, or is it barren?
Matt: No, no. There's furniture, and a lot of the furniture here is really well made, dark woods, fine deep red and maroon fabrics. A lot of it has dust on it.
Taliesin: Plastic covers? No plastic covers?
Matt: No plastic covers. But some of the furniture here is for use and some of it is here just as part of the decor, and it's very easy to see which ones are which.
Laura: I'm definitely going to sit on the ones that are just for decor.
Matt: Okay, they're really uncomfortable.
Laura: Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it.
Matt: You leave a little butt-print in the dust. Perfect. At which point, Bertholt acknowledges that you guys will be staying. "Could I get anything for you? Perhaps teas, juice, water?"
Travis: What is this bullshit, no ale?
Laura: Do you have fermented juice?
Matt: "I'll fetch the wine." And he hobbles off to acquire some means of imbibement.
Travis: Should we pay him? We just found out he's dead fucking broke.
Laura: I'd rather not.
Travis: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. You make your way back to the second floor and off to the far western end of the estate, to what you recall being Maryanne's chambers. So as you enter her room, which has become her own study, as you recall last time seeing her, her room was becoming more and more of a functional office, and as you knock and push the door open like a familiar brother does, not wishing for any patience on her end, necessarily, you can see the interiors. The bed's there for function. Most if it is, I wouldn't say a replica, but it very much resembles the decor and mood of your father's study. You see her currently sitting at a desk in the corner. Her blonde hair is tied back in a tied braid that runs down her back. She wears a coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little formally or businesslike for being casually at home. You haven't really seen her dress like this before, at least not in a casual circumstance. As you glance over past the doorway she looks up from her papers and goes, "Brother!"
Sam: Hello, sister.
Matt: "Brother, what--" She closes the book. You can see she's been looking over ledgers and catalogues. Looks like she's been doing a fair amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a very formal way and begins to step towards you. "When have you arrived?"
Sam: Just today. Father kidnapped me and brought me home.
Matt: "Kidnapped?"
Sam: Well, I'm not a kid, but still works. Abducted. Abducted me and brought me home. Paid someone to do it.
Matt: "Right."
Sam: Yes. Anyway, it's good to see you. Your room is coming along quite nicely. It seems like you're running the show now, is that true?
Matt: "No, not quite, but the responsibilities have definitely been mounting. You look well. How have the wind-tossed roads of Exandria treated you this past year?"
Sam: Well, I have had many adventures and close calls, but I won't bore you with those details. It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction part and also the fact that I've now learned that we are destitute? Is that true?
Matt: "We're on the path to destitution, yes."
Sam: So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt me.
Matt: "Probably both, to be honest. We're in a relatively dire situation compared to our previous long-standing lifestyle choices. We're trying to fix this mess."
Sam: And what would have been your plan had I not arrived today?
Matt: "Well, you were part of the plan. We're trying to figure this out the best we can and given the circumstances, we feel this is probably one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky endeavors in which we can right the family's trajectory."
Sam: By marrying me to some lady I've never met?
Matt: "Oh, you're welcome to meet her. I've met her. I helped to arrange this."
Sam: What is she like?
Matt: "She's very nice. She's very pretty, a bit bookish, which once again would befit you rather well, but let's be honest. This is a political marriage. You do what you want. I mean, there isn't a politician or a lord of this land that hasn't in some way, shape, or form made their own life outside of the family." At that point, you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak with this bit of sarcasm.
Sam: And father's businesses, are they being run the same way? With the same attention to detail?
Matt: "There's been no necessary change to the way business has been done. Other than the transition of some responsibilities, of course." And she gives a slight nod. She's getting a little uncomfortable as this conversation continues.
Sam: Listen, I'm sorry to pop in like this and challenge your judgment, but me marrying this person would solve our problems long-term? Somehow?
Matt: "Marrying into this family, the Truscan lot, would enable us the resources and connections to reacquire the deeds to our land, to reacquire the business elements that we've been in this unnecessary partnership with for some time, and would enable us to once again reclaim complete rulership of our family-controlled lands."
Sam: Do we not own anything anymore?
Matt: "It is a partnership that is quickly sliding into the behest of the Myriad."
Sam: So what is ours now? Anything? Our personal belongings? This home?
Matt: "We still own everything, in partnership. Own solely on our own? Some of the furniture."
Sam: And again, if I do this, what's to say we're not just going to drive up another debt again? Doesn't seem like father or you have been very good at keeping us in the black.
Matt: "I have only been recently brought into this unfortunate circumstance, brother. And you can trust in knowing that in my studies and my time spent here, working with father, being very clear, and very thorough with the mistakes he's made in the past, I will not be doomed to repeat them."
Sam: So you and he are two peas in a pod, yes?
Matt: "Well, he's certainly in need of retiring based on the stress he's put upon himself. It would not be long until I will take over the responsibilities."
Sam: Well, I may poke around and see if there's another way I could help. But before I do, is this fun for you? Do you like running this business, or almost running it?
Matt: "It's certainly a better challenge than many other daughters of lords are given in their time."
Sam: Do you have any friends?
Matt: "Friends come, when the money and power's in place. You know this."
Sam: I do.
Matt: "It's the way the land works."
Sam: Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love the decorations. I'm considering the offer and I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.
Matt: "Wonderful." As you begin to make any sort of exit, she catches you and goes, "Brother, your arrival here is a great boon to us. You have the power to change the fate of this family. Consider the respect you have for the people who have worked their entire lives to provide for you what you have been given. Mother and Father sacrificed so much for us. Consider weighing one's selfish interest versus the importance of a bloodline. That is all I ask."
Sam: All right. I'll consider it. With all my intellect.
Matt: "Well, it's good to see you." She steps forward and gives you a half-hug. It's like--
Sam: A pat. The back pat. Good day.
Matt: "Good day." She straightens her coat and sits back behind her desk and waits for you to leave.
Sam: All right. I'll shimmy out. (sighs) All right, I'll rejoin my friends downstairs. Well--
Laura: How did it go?
Liam: Well, yourself.
Sam: As expected. Things are about the same between me and Maryanne.
Laura: Is she still a raging bitch?
Sam: No, she's not raging.
Ashley: I just think it's rather rude that she doesn't want to come down here and meet us.
Sam: She has her work and her--
Liam: Oh, she's not coming down?
Sam: No.
Liam: That's weird.
Sam: I mean, I don't know, she's busy. I guess.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: They're not guest people. They're not dinner party family.
Liam: We picked up on that.
Laura: Not even for people who could help them with their name?
Marisha: Did you mention us or anything else?
Sam: Nope. It didn't come up.
Liam: Did they have any idea what a heavy hitter you are now? The type of people you roll with?
Sam: They said, how have I been? But they don't really give a shit either way.
Marisha: So you didn't even offer up the information?
Sam: If they are not interested in me, why should I be interested in them knowing about me?
Laura: That's a very good point.
Liam: Let's back it up. What are you thinking? Where's your head at? How can we help you?
Sam: I don't know what to do. There's this woman; she's apparently nice and I could go for it and marry her, and then it seems like all my family problems would be okay.
Ashley: Forever?
Marisha: There's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever.
Travis: Really?
Sam: I don't know. I'm sort of curious about talking to the people who are in this contract with my father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out of it a little bit, but I don't know how to solve everything right now. I also don't know-- I feel a duty, a responsibility to this family, because they are my family.
Marisha: Grog!
Travis: You feel a doodie? The privy is over there! Or over there! Or the front yard beckons.
Taliesin: He may have opened a bottle of wine.
Travis: I'm lost for the rest of this conversation.
Laura: No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a little bit of wine, just a small amount.
Travis: I carved my name into the floor.
Sam: Part of me wants to-- oh god. Part of me wants to turn around and go back with you to Whitestone and forget that the Darringtons exist, but I don't think I can't do that. I am a Darrington and I owe it at least to my name to try and fix what I can.
Laura: That's your plan?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Don't sacrifice your entire life for this, though.
Sam: Well, I'll try not to, but it seems like a plan B at this point.
Liam: Also, you had no prior knowledge to your family's connection to the mob?
Sam: No? It's way cooler than I thought my family ever was. I knew my dad did shady business with lots of shady characters but I never knew-- I assumed he paid off people. I assumed he had friends in high places and people who you'd have to bribe to turn the other cheek, but I never knew that he was in business with them, owing our whole existence to these terrible people, and I don't know what to make of that
Liam: T, I think we're all prepared to help you do anything you want to do, but are you sure you want to help perpetuate the family business?
Sam: Definitely not. Listen, I think there's two steps to this: there's the short term and the long term. We have to solve this short-term need really quickly. Not this whole 230,000-dollar-- I mean -gold debt. It's a Whitestone term, I mean a Wildmount. Oh my god. My phone rang! I'm confused! Anyway, listen, couple drinks before-- no. We have a short-term problem that we can maybe go alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the Laughing Ninny or whatever it's called. The Grumpy Lily.
Liam: I like the Laughing Ninny. I kinda want to go there instead.
Taliesin: It's a stand-up comedy club. (laughter)
Sam: And then there's a long-term problem which I'll have to solve on another day. There's a long- term problem that my family is awful and needs to be stopped at all costs, and that's something that I'll have to deal with tomorrow.
Laura: Do the Truscans, that's who you are being married into potentially, do they have a son?
Taliesin: That doesn't help! That's almost beside the point!
Sam: You're talking about marrying the sister? Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, that's still--
Laura: I guess it's not the same, is it?
Taliesin: No! Actually, it's unfortunately the opposite.
Sam: You're royalty. You know this!
Laura: Of course, I know everything about royalty.
Sam: Little royal girl.
Marisha: What exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog!
Taliesin: Lilah? Is it Lilah?
All: Lydia.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should talk to this Lydia as well, because she is obviously in a position of being told what she is going to do with herself.
Marisha: Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass!
Liam: At the very least, we should meet all the chess pieces on the board, right?
Sam: I mean, she lives in another part of the kingdom, right, Matthew Mercer?
Marisha: That's not a problem.
Sam: Oh yes, that's true. But there's the in-town people we can meet first.
Laura: Sure. Let's talk to the mob!
Sam: Yes, of course! You'll come with me? Because I can't talk to the mob by myself.
Laura: Tary, of course we will!
Travis: Wait, when you said we need to stop your family at all costs, are you talking about killing them?
Sam: No, I'm not talking about killing them.
Marisha: Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that I was trying to make before he started laughing when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you committed to keeping your family around? You said you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about--
Taliesin: Stop it, Travis! God, I can't--
Marisha: Tearing your family apart? And stopping them?
Sam: My family is pretty bad, I've learned. But I've also learned from young Trickfoot that even a rotten family is worth trying to save. And I admire the path that she took with her family, and I would like to at least try to push mine in the right direction and try to make our name a little less shitty.
Liam: That is a pretty big matzo ball, my friend.
Sam: Well, that's why that's long term. In the short term, I just want to get them safe.
Marisha: If there's one thing I understand, it's giving your life to a cause.
Sam: I don't want to die, if that's what you're saying.
Marisha: No.
Sam: Dedicating.
Marisha: Dedicating.
Sam: Thank you.
Marisha: Time is a gift, I would say.
Sam: Sure.
Marisha: So dedicating that gift is, it's a big thing, but I hope you believe in it.
Sam: I don't believe in them, but I believe in the cause right now, and we'll see how far that takes us.
Marisha: We believe in you.
Sam: You guys.
Travis: Can you describe to me this duty?
Marisha: You don't care!
Travis: I think I do now. Is it real hard?
Sam: It's a little more nebulous than that, Grog.
Taliesin: We can pass on this for now.
Travis: Adjectives are not my strong suit, so.
Laura: You know what an adjective is! That's impressive.
Travis: Yeah. No, I got it one time at this tavern. I had it for two nights. It just itched everywhere.
Sam: Listen. When you see my duty, you'll know.
Travis: Copy that.
Liam: It's loose. This duty is loose.
Laura: Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?
Taliesin: Please.
Laura: This is going so well.
Matt: As you're exiting the house and Berthold's opening the door, you hear some heavy creaking from the stair that leads down to the main area, and you watch as an older woman in her early fifties or so with her mid-length, curly brown hair in shades of gray, green eyes behind a small set of reading spectacles, stoic of face, wearing what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted silk robe, clutching a book under her arm, comes down the steps and looks down and goes, "Taryon?"
Sam: Mama?
Matt: "Taryon, my boy!" And she sets the book down and walks up, puts her hands out as she says, "Oh," takes you at the sides of the face and pulls you in for (kisses). "Oh, terribly sorry. I didn't realize that we had guests."
Sam: Oh, yes, these are my allies and my friends. This is the team known as Vox Machina. They are a fearless band of adventurers and they have taken me in as their own.
Matt: "Look at you, so rugged!"
Sam: Well. Yes, I am, a bit!
Matt: "So you've had some adventures with my boy, have you?"
All: We have.
Matt: "That's wonderful. Have you spoken with your father?"
Sam: Yes, I've spoken to Father, and Sister, and it's good to know they're healthy. And it's lovely to see you, as well. Have you been happy at all, this last year?
Matt: "I--" And she reaches back and takes the book off the step and goes, "I've been making my way through your library."
Sam: Oh! Oh, my books, in my room.
Matt: "Yes! Well, I've had a lot of time to myself. Been a bit under the weather for some time, and these have kept me fine company."
Sam: Oh. That's lovely. I hope you've enjoyed them as much as I did. What's your favorite one?
Matt: "Well, not this piece of trash." And she sets it down. "There's one. What was it called? The River's Dawn. It was a brilliant--"
Sam: Before the River's Dawn, yes.
Matt: "Before the River's Dawn! That one, yes. It was a continuation of the creation myth of Wildmount, but it turned into the spirits of the gods, these two fauns, and they fell in love but could not be together because the dawn had to rise and the sun would shine. It was very, very beautiful!"
Sam: Yes, yes! No it was, but also heartbreaking at the same time.
Matt: "Very much so. It reminded me of you."
Sam: Yes. That's one of my favorites, as well.
Matt: "Well. I didn't break the binding too much, I hope."
Sam: I'll fix it if you did. It's all right.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Well, that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad you've been entertaining yourself. I know living with Papa can be very hard, and it's been very hard on you all these years.
Matt: "If you would excuse us for just a moment, please. Just a few moments." And she points towards the door.
Sam: I told you they were like this.
Travis: Yeah, no, we're going out the front door. Front yard.
Marisha: Bottle of wine!
Matt: Berthold is leading you out of the main area, out the front door.
Travis: Yeah, front door!
Laura: Out the house, like get out?
Matt: You guys were on your way out.
Sam: Just wait on the fucking porch!
Liam: We got it.
Laura: Fine.
Matt: As soon as she has some privacy with you, she goes, "My boy, if you could indulge me in some strange honesty, I'm rather intrigued at this idea. I don't wish to undermine anything that we've built as a family. I've lived a privileged life for a very long time, far longer than you and your sister have. I've lived within this house, removed from the world. I do as responsibility asks of me, my wedded duties as both a wife and a mother, and I do so without complaint. I have always seen you fight these same circumstances bravely, and I find vicarious joy in your escape from this place this past year. These books are a reminder of that same bravery. I know Howaardt has said many things, and he may be right. But there's a little part of me that welcomes a little change in scenery and lifestyle. Maybe that's what the family needs. I don't know. Perhaps I'm foolhardy. I know not."
Sam: No, you're right to think this way. This year has been eye-opening for me, and I know that you care for Papa, and you are a diligent and faithful wife. But I know how hard it must have been to live this life for so many years and I wonder what it would be like if you hadn't been with him, what kind of person you would be.
Matt: "Looking at you, looking at your sister, I wouldn't change it for the world."
Sam: Well, things are going to have to change at some point, right?
Matt: "One way or another. I just-- (sighs) I just want you to make choices for yourself. I want you to do what you think is right, that you could live with. Duty and blood is one thing, but... Anyway, I'm talking out of turn."
Sam: No. Thank you. Thank you for that.
Matt: "Could you not tell Howaardt we've had this conversation?"
Sam: Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.
Matt: "I would like that very much."
Sam: Good evening.
Matt: "Good evening." As you leave, she's like, "Oh! The other one I was trying to remember was The Mountain Range of Gold. It was a wonderful three-part series--"
Sam: When you think he's dead, but he's not, and he comes back?
Matt: "Well, the second book, you get halfway through it before he even turns and reveals himself!"
Sam: I know! Well, you never see the body in the first one, so that should have been a tip-off.
Matt: "And then the white robes and everything! His renewed power, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm sorry, you have your friends waiting on you. Good night, Taryon."
Sam: Yes.
Liam: I want to adopt her.
Marisha: She's awesome!
Matt: So as you step out to greet the rest of your friends?
Sam: All right, let's go to the Jumping Jimmy, or whatever it's called.
Laura: How's your mother?
Sam: She's better. I mean, she's had a tough time. That was the longest conversation I've had with her in many years.
Laura: Wow.
Ashley: She said she's under the weather. What's wrong?
Sam: I think everybody's super stressed out and heartsick about everything that's happening, and living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy. You should have seen me when I lived here. I was not nearly as dashing or as charming as I am now. It took me spreading my wings and flying before I found my sense of humor. My hair looks better, my eyes look better.
Marisha: I thought you said that was because of the aloe vera.
Sam: Well, yes. We didn't have any at home.
Marisha: Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you.
Sam: I mean, life needs aloe to live. Is something I always say.
Taliesin: That's true.
Liam: I've heard you say that two or three times.
Sam: Moisturizing products in general. Life needs moisturizing products to live.
Taliesin: Life needs moisture to live.
Ashley: I know my beauty regimen's changed.
Marisha: Life needs moisture to live. It's way smarter-sounding.
Taliesin: All right, gauntlet dropped.
Laura: All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is.
Matt: All right. Who's leading this charge? Probably you, Taryon.
Sam: I know the place.
Liam: You are in charge while we're here.
Matt: You've never been to this place. You've heard of it, but you'd never be seen dead in a place like this before. You lead your way in. At this point, because when you arrived the sun was still in the sky, but it was deep in the sky, so by now it's post-dusk. You now see the massive stone and wood structures of Deastok are dark against the ever-dark sky with the windows now aglow, this warm yellows and orange of the candle and lantern-lit interiors. You can see there are hanging lanterns that are put out there, and you can see a number of individuals who seem to work for the city, who go and place these lanterns up in each of these poles, are now finishing their job and are returning to the evening. Following these lamps, along the street, the cobblestones are still really well kept for as old as this town seems to be. For a city that isn't a major metropolis within a kingdom, and what your experience has been in Tal'Dorei, a fair amount of money still makes it way through this city. Eventually, you find your way fairly far north into the city until you come across the exterior of the Grumpy Lily. Asking a few questions to guide you to which building it is, it's much smaller than you expected. You see what appears to be a single-story pub with one window, one door, no more than maybe 30 feet on any given side. It is lit from the inside, though it's dimly lit. As you approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway, you see before you what appears to be three tables. Three singular, stained, brown tables. One lone patron sits at the center table, an elderly man inspecting a small, clay sculpture that he's enraptured by, and a single barkeep to your right that seems to notice your entry. A healthy, pale woman of brunette hair in her forties, dressed in a simple gray blouse. As soon as you enter and take in the atmosphere, she goes, "Slow day, folks! Happy to have the business! What can I get you?"
Liam: Jeez, Grog, I don't even know if you're going to fit in here.
Travis: Yeah, it's really tiny.
Matt: Your head does reach the ceiling.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Just dive in then?
Sam: Should we get anything to drink first? Or just dive in?
Travis: Yeah, it's like how you have to buy something to use the restroom.
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz? I was just wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a red wine?
Matt: "Yes! That I can get for you, dear. Don't worry. Red wine we can do definitely." She walks over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and what you thought was once the patron now appears to be the one barman there. "Wait! What! Oh. I missed the conversation."
Travis: Oh the guy with the sculpture?
Matt: Yeah. "Red wine, for our guests." "Oh." He stands up and begrudgingly walks over. You see his back is hunched forward and he's (pained grunting). Leaves the room for a second. "Well, sit down, find a place wherever you like."
Sam: Put two tables together, I guess?
Laura: All three, really.
Marisha: Let's just take them all.
Travis: Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check this area for anything shady?
Taliesin: Is there shade in this establishment?
Matt: It's dimly lit, so there's plenty of shadows.
Liam: It's a five-by-five square. Do we see anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.
Matt: Nothing seems amiss. It seems like a shitty pub. It's the definition of a poorly attended dive.
Laura: Does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?
Matt: You can make an investigation check if you want to.
Laura: 17.
Matt: You begin to look around the floor and keep perspective around the area. No. You see some stains, you see some crumbs, and at one point you look over in the corner and you see what appears to be a piece of stale bread that's been left under one of the tables and there are three rats currently eating it. As soon as you lean in, they all stop and look at you and scatter.
Laura: Oh, you can keep going.
Taliesin: Could be worse. They could not be afraid of you.
Laura: That's true.
Matt: (laughs) They just give you the fuck-you look and keep eating their bread.
Taliesin: That's when you know you've really found the right bar. The rats were like: "We reserved this table two weeks ago. You have to make a phone call."
Matt: The elderly barman walks in now and he's got two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling. (grunts, clinks) "I'll get your cups." Turns around and starts shuffling back.
Laura: (laughing) Do you need any help?
Marisha: I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine.
Taliesin: Just let it happen.
Sam: Okay. Who do you think we proposition here? The old man?
Liam: That guy.
Sam: That guy? Really? What makes you say that?
Taliesin: Shifty eyes.
Liam: Shifty yeah, may be an act, even.
Sam: He's just old I thought. No?
Laura: Nobody's just old.
Liam: He's many things.
Marisha: That's true, look at Pike's grandpa.
Liam: Look at Pike.
Ashley: Look at me.
Liam: How old are you, again?
Ashley: 142.
Liam: I said goddamn.
Sam: Is that true?
Ashley: No.
Sam: Oh. (laughter)
Sam: Oh. Well, because you could be.
Ashley: I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old I am.
Sam: Is it in the hundreds?
Ashley: No. I think it's in the 30s.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Ashley: Right?
Matt: Whatever you want.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: You ain't no baby.
Matt: The gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch of cups. His hands wrung through all the various handles. (grunts, clicks)
Laura: Impressive.
Matt: (grunts) "Two gold for both bottles."
Laura: I give him two gold.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: You're welcome.
Sam: In my earring, I say to Vex  I'm clamming up, you do it.
Laura: Sir?
Matt: You see him walking and he goes like (sighs).
Laura: On your way to the back, could you tell the Many we'd like to speak to them?
Matt: He slowly turns his head over to the bartender, the woman. "What was that?"
Laura: Oh, just a conversation with the Many.
Matt: "What about them?"
Liam: I dip my thumb into some wine and I use thieves' cant and write "discuss" in wine on the bar.
Matt: (click) She gives a click noise to the old man, who goes (groan, thump) Are you going to take your bottles or what?
Laura: No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those.
Matt: "All right, pick them up. Follow me."
Taliesin: Oh, we're going to get to see the real bar.
Matt: He turns around and shuffles out. It's like following a bad, slow NPC in World of Warcraft. You're like, just go fucking faster! His pace is terrible. Yeah, it's awful.
Laura: Running ahead, turning around.
Matt: Exactly, just waiting.
Travis: Over here, adventurer!
Matt: Eventually, he takes you out of the small pub, past the unused kitchen, which has another series of stale bread clumps on the side, down to what looks to be a broom closet. He gets there to the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key ring.
Laura: I want to pay attention to what key he's taking.
Marisha: Can I take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down so the rats could have it?
Matt: Sure. So you walk over to the kitchen and grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down on the ground and you wait there, because there's no rats present. And you're like, bread crumbs. They scatter a little further out. You turn around and the minute you turn, in the air you hear (skittering) and look over, and there's like seven rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are just going at these crumbs immediately.
Travis: I kill all of them.
Laura: Sploosh!
Liam: I nudge my sister and say, all mine.
Laura: Yes. That she is.
Matt: He pulls one key and unlocks the small closet. You paid attention? (creak) Opens this rickety wooden door, and goes (grunt) and walks past, and he's behind the door, expectantly waiting. You guys glance into the space, and you can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that descends about 30, 40 feet.
Liam: Traps, people hiding, anything that seems out of place or dangerous.
Matt: Traps, or people hiding?
Liam: Traps.
Laura: I'll look for people hiding.
Matt: Perception check, investigation check.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 24.
Marisha: Twinsies!
Ashley: Twinsies!
Matt: Look at that. That's disgusting. All right, so you guys make your way down. No traps in the stair descent, but you make your way to the bottom of the stairs without issue. You don't see anything necessarily fishy. You do see these torches have been burning for a little bit, a couple hours, and are probably needing to be re-upped pretty soon. You guys eventually make your way down, and as soon as the last of you-- who's following up the rear in this, by the way? What's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go toward the front with the twins?
Matt: The hallway here is about big enough for you to go single file.
Laura: Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary?
Ashley: I'm in front of Grog.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike.
Taliesin: I'm in the center, as well.
Travis: I'm in the back.
Matt: Okay, so Grog's in the very back. Keyleth, Percy.
Laura: Pike is with Grog.
Matt: Yeah, Pike's with Grog. So we'll say, Grog in the back, then Pike, then Keyleth, then Percy, then Taryon?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: And Vex and Vax. And you have Trinket in your necklace, I assume? Okay. All right, so you guys descend down the stairway. As soon as, Grog, you make your way in, it's tiny. You have to (straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just walking through the pathway, your shoulders are rubbing against the sides of the wall, and your head occasionally (bang, bang).
Laura: It's like you in Japan, baby!
Travis: I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two shower heads. Just turning around, I was like (crash).
Liam: The beds, was that like lying down on a saltine for you?
Travis: Oh yeah. My heels were just over like the--
Laura: We went into McDonald's and his head hit the ceiling!
Matt: You are a kaiju!
Ashley: A kaiju from the deep! A level seven!
Marisha: Okay, wait, before we go any further.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wait.
Travis: Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any further, wait.
Marisha: Do I have to be doing a short rest to do the Inspiring Leader thing?
Matt: It's ten minutes, it takes to do.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Laura: Well, no, we could stand here for ten minutes!
Travis: Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words!
Marisha: I'm new to the being an inspiring leader thing.
Matt: Yeah, it's ten minutes, before you know you're going to go into something, you stop and do this.
Marisha: I should've done that at the bar.
Liam: Wouldn't that be cool if you were just pep-talking us all the way down here?
Sam: Start it now.
Laura: Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're walking!
Marisha: Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like  You know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away--
Matt: The door closes behind Grog and you hear it lock.
Marisha: And I feel like we've grown so much as people, and you guys are family. You're a family to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys remember that time in Stillben? When we very first met, and we all didn't really like each other, and Grog, I don't think you understood me for a while.
Travis: Still don't.
Marisha: Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog, do you remember that one time--
Matt: This is great, by the way, because at the bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15 more feet before there's a door. There's a man on a stool who's just sitting there going--
Liam: She'll just be another minute.
Travis: I'm about to find out what the inside of a Bag of Holding feels like, I swear.
Matt: He's not stopping you.
Marisha: Do you remember that time-- I think it was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do an "I'm going down the stairs" thing through the floor?
Travis: Oh yeah!
Marisha: Yeah, I just remembered that the other day, and I just love you guys so much, you know?
Taliesin: I don't feel included in this.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't think you were around yet. But I love you so much!
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel better. That's all.
Sam: Any change in our bodies or anything?
Liam: She's going for ten in-game, real-time minutes.
Matt: As you guys are all in the hallway, Grog at the back, you can't move forward, because everyone's stopped, and you're just like-- (groan) All of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit points. That's by the inspiring leader feat.
Marisha: Oh yeah, you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points!
Matt: It is your choice as to whether or not you felt inspired by that and take them.
Marisha: And I love you guys. I love you guys so much.
Matt: Grog's too uncomfortable to take them.
Travis: No, I just start weeping silently in the back.
Liam: I mean, let's be honest, he wouldn't even feel the difference.
Matt: That's true, yeah. That's what Grog needs, is temporary hit points.
Liam: Grog would just go (sneezes).
Marisha: Not showing your sensitivity?
Laura: Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good. That was a nice trip down memory lane.
Ashley: I feel inspired.
Laura: Oh, hey! How's it going there?
Matt: You see this guy, he's tough and surly, looks like a balding man who's just like made of muscle and anger. He's sitting there with one eye open, one a little squinted, he's just--
Laura: Do you feel inspired? No.
Liam: Not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?
Matt: He doesn't seem to respond. You do hear like a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a faint beat of some kind from the other side of the wall, just muffled.
Taliesin: Is the password, "I am what I am," not sure? Too strange a reference; never mind.
Matt: He begins to reach over for what looks to be a small lever that's hidden on the side.
Laura: We're here to speak to the Many.
Matt: Stops. (grunts)
Sam: We're in.
Laura: We're going to just go on in, then.
Sam: That word just gets us in.
Matt: So. As you guys enter this doorway, as it pushes open, you're immediately hit with a wall of voices and laughter and conversation, interweaving in multiple languages. This is far more lively than you expected it would be, it's a large tavern hall. It's almost two stories tall, but it's open. There's a central, circular chandelier that hangs over with what looks to be flickering candles in a circle around it. You can see elements of what are almost like a second floor, but it's more like a slight balcony outcropping. You don't see any doorways, it's just a level platform above, and there before you, you see what has to be three or four dozen people scattered across a number of tables, all in various forms of dress and many of them are drinking, some of them are playing games of chance, some of them are in deep conversation. You can see, the music-- though this is a bad example, but it's what I have-- it's not a full band, per se. It looks like there's a set of three percussionists in the far corner that are all in the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that shifts and changes. Some of them are on more of a hand drum, some of them are more small percussion instruments. It's interesting. It's not the usual bar atmosphere you're used to. It has almost a weird--
Sam: Would you say more like Blue Man Group or more like a subway bucket drummer?
Matt: I'd say it's in between the two, actually. Take a little Blue Man Group and a little bit of subway bucket drummer. It's right in between there. You guys step into the chamber and take in the atmosphere a bit. Whether that be with smiles, awe, or confusion and care.
Taliesin: That's exactly what I said, the real bar.
Ashley: I like this.
Liam: This is like old times.
Matt: As soon as you begin having this conversation and taking in the atmosphere, one of four bar hands sees you approach. You see a jagged smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that immediately comes up to you. "Aye, friends! New faces are few and far between here in Deastok. Welcome to our little slice of the family. What can I get you?"
Sam: Well, we brought bottles. That's rude, isn't it?
Laura: The good stuff is down here.
Matt: "I don't know where you got that shit but put that away. We'll get you right fucked up, eh?"
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz?
Matt: "I'll see what I can muster."
Marisha: I like these people!
Matt: "Slim pickings for room here. It's a bit early in the evening. That's when it's the busiest. Just find some space, sit down. Folks don't want you to sit by them? Don't fucking sit by them."
Laura: Thank you. Do we see room for a large group?
Matt: You see two tables that have room for half of a large group.
Laura: All right. Split up?
Sam: Why don't we ask them nicely if they would like to move?
Laura: No, let's not do that.
Travis: Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself.
Sam: No?
Taliesin: No. This is special.
Travis: How about the talkers go to one table?
Marisha: And then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad. I like that.
Travis: The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to the talkers' table.
Laura: Yeah, obviously.
Marisha: Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good talkers.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: I'll join you.
Liam: I'm actually going to wander the room.
Marisha: I'll sit with Grog and Pike.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah, Shiraz time.
Laura: All right.
Sam: What's our play here? Do we just keep saying the word "many" as many times as we can and see how far it goes?
Laura: This is about as in as we get with the Many.
Sam: This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or him by name? Korshad?
Laura: Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves too quickly.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: We could buy Korshad a drink.
Laura: That is a beautiful idea.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Care of one Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Of course. I have just enough for a nice drink.
Laura: Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party funds cover the drink. It's just in your name.
Sam: Oh. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I'm slow to catch on sometimes.
Laura: Can we grab a barmaid?
Matt: You split between the two tables. One of the tables appears to be three guys who are in a card game. As soon as you sit down they (grunts) and then keep talking amongst themselves more about taking bets, bluffing each other, giving shit about their home lives, stuff like that. The other table has four quiet individuals that are, look to be elvish lineage. Either half-elf or full elf; it's hard to tell. They're wearing these hoods that show the ears from underneath but then seem to block a lot of the features of their face and guard a lot of the forehead. This silk hood that drips down past the nose on the sides.
Laura: Do we recognize any semblance of that garb?
Matt: Make a history check.
Sam: History check.
Laura: Well, my history is shit, but 19.
Matt: 19. You haven't seen this kind of dress, but you've heard of it. It seems to be of Wildmount but the eastern side of Wildmount, not a part of the Dwendalian Empire. This more stems from Zorhaus, which is the other kingdom on the continent. It's actually in a tense existence along the border of the Dwendalian Empire.
Laura: You said it was to the east?
Matt: Zorhaus, I'm pretty sure that's what it's called.
Laura: It is now.
Matt: It is! It's whatever it's called in the campaign guide.
Laura: Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to stick to what you wrote. That's crazy.
Matt: I know, I'll just have to look it up again. But anyway. As soon as you sit down at the table the four individuals look at each other and then get up from the table and then walk off to find another place.
Laura: Maybe some of us don't smell very good in this group. I'm not one of them, though. I smell amazing.
Liam: I smell fucking fantastic, and I'm over there. I am going to laze about the musicians and listen to the musicians and wait for them to finish a set.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people--
Matt: All of you guys can sit at the table now that you've forced them off their own space. The guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind. As you sit around the table, the barhand that met you here approaches and once more goes, "All right, looks like you've found a place to sit, what can I get you? Got you that shiraz you were asking for, eh." He goes ahead and he pulls up what looks to be a dark green bottle, already uncorked and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or tankard and then pours it in there. It appears to be something akin to a shiraz, I suppose. Fills it to the top, slides it forward. "All right. Drinks for anyone else, eh?"
Travis: Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both?
Taliesin: To drink.
Travis: Do they not have food?
Laura: No, probably.
Matt: "I can get you a meat pie, if that's what you're asking. I don't recommend you drink it, though you could probably squeeze water from a stone, so wouldn't surprise me if you could."
Travis: Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please.
Matt: "All right, coming on up. Anyone else?"
Laura: Whiskey?
Taliesin: Same.
Matt: "It can be done. So whiskey. And you, little one?"
Ashley: Well, you said you have things that will fuck you up right, so what would that be considered?
Matt: "Oh, I mean no offense, lady, but you're a bit small-sized--"
All: Whoa!
Matt: "I mean that respectfully! Look, I'm just looking out for my patrons here. I don't want to go ahead and send someone to the local temple."
Laura: She can drink most people under the table.
Ashley: Bring it!
Matt: "All right. I'll take your word for it, then."
Sam: I'll have another shiraz.
Matt: "Another shiraz."
Liam: Over the earring  Pickle, will you get me one of those, as well, and don't drink it before I come back?
Ashley: As a matter of fact, I want two of whatever that is.
Matt: "All right, coming up." And he leaves the table.
Taliesin: Did you order the drink for when he comes back?
Sam: Oh the other drink? Oh fuck. Wait, before he goes, pardon me. I have one more order to make. I would like to buy a drink for Korshad, courtesy of Taryon Darrington. And I'll slip him a gold piece.
Travis: I thought you were about to shake his hand with two fingers.
Sam: There is a coin between the two fingers.
Matt: "Korshad, you say?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: I nudge him under the table.
Matt: "You want what he likes, it's going to cost you more than that."
Laura: What does he like?
Sam: Whatever it is, here is another four and keep another one for yourself.
Matt: "Thank you very much. That'll put you up to yours, though. We will go ahead and settle your bills at the end of the drinks. But all right, Korshad it is."
Taliesin: What table did the bartender look at when he said that?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, I was planning on totally watching that, too.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's a safe 13.
Laura: Should I roll, too?
Matt: Well, you said you were looking, too, so roll a perception, yeah.
Laura: Well yeah, okay. 30.
Matt: 30, okay. You gather the direction that he glanced. It was a cursory look, more to see if the individual in question was still in the room or not. But you got the direction of it, and you know exactly where he was looking-- three tables and that way there. He leaves for a bit, and the laughter is still rising and falling throughout the room. The musicians in the corner, which are two younger human boys and what appears to be a female goliath, who has the heavier drum in the center, who is like the mid-piece, the big (heavy drum noises). The two guys, one of them has a small set of lap drums, (light drum noises) the faster beats. And the guy to the left of her-- they could be brothers; you're not too sure, their features are similar but different enough, the ages seem off. The guy on the left has a series of small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort of contraption that has three or four different small percussion instruments that are all fixed to it and so he is leaping between them all. For being just percussion, that variety is still making a cool melody. You're still able to find certain notes and certain blends where it still is a very different and unique atmosphere. They manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that you entered on, and it finishes. There is no real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here and most everyone is busy about their own shit.
Liam: All right, I clap. Excuse me, players?
Matt: As they're both looking over to grab a drink to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances over to you: "Yeah?"
Liam: That was a really unique piece you guys just did there. Thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Liam: You know, I have only ever heard music like that one time, and it wasn't here. It wasn't in this city, it was actually in Emon. What was his name? Dranzel. It was a musician named Dranzel-- this is a long shot, but you haven't come across a Dr. Dranzel in your travels? I've always wanted to hear him play again.
Matt: "Can't say I have, sir. My apologies."
Liam: Oh, shit.
Matt: "Sorry. You guys ever heard of Dr. Dranzel?" And the other guy goes, "Nope."
Liam: Orcish. Stylish hats.
Matt: The goliath woman is sitting there and she is just staring off across the room and goes, "No." (laughter)
Matt: "Sorry, friend."
Laura: I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and delivering drinks to the people.
Matt: Okay. You watch the gentleman who has been getting you guys drinks, and he is in the process of getting all of your various drink orders and pouring what you have requested, and he does come to a point where he gets this one fine jewel goblet that he has specifically set off to the side and he takes it and washes it and takes care to clean it entirely and dry it off, and once it's set there he reaches underneath, counting a few bottles and pulls one drink, uncorks it and there is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he uncorks it he pours it into there, glances over, grabs another thing, seems to be mixing it with something else. He is being very careful with the actual amounts he is pouring. He finishes that, takes a piece of what looks like an orange, crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and takes it and swishes it for a second. (sighs) And walks over to a table across the entire hall, where you saw him glance before.
Sam: One sex on the beach! (laughter)
Matt: He walks over to a table where you see what appear to be about five different patrons at the table. Most of them wealthily dressed. Two of them appear to be older mercantile or business owners, they wear the jewelry on their hands very extravagantly and displaying both wealth and prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most high-end guild workers or owners tend to display. You are very familiar with caste systems that have emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan areas, and so you can very easily pick up some of those themes. Two of them appear as a contrast very simply dressed. No jewelry. You can't make out any details in this distance and there is one man who he hands the drink to, he sets it down in front of him and slides it forward. The man you see there, he has deep brown skin, marked, there appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears on each side. He's wearing light, billowing clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about the elbow and are just hanging beneath, leaving the rest of his arm completely visible where you can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and grasps the back of the hand, almost like he has a gauntlet on that is just his skin. You see around him a series of gold and silver bracelets and rings that adorn his fingers. His face is framed by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked hair. Because of your perception check, at this distance and your ranger-like eyes, you can see what you perceive to be a visible scar on his throat from ear to ear. He's currently mid-conversation with the patrons at the table, leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting and as soon as the drink-- huh?
Laura: Can I read his lips?
Matt: Sure. Well, the drink arrives and gets pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as he says, "This drink is a gift to you from patrons on the other side of the place." And this individual, who you assume at this point is probably Korshad, gives a look and goes, (grunts). And he points over, right over to your table across the room. You watch as Korshad sits up, glances over your direction, sees you looking at him directly. Takes the drink, scoots it over next to his side, and folds his fingers and goes back into listening to the conversation of the other patrons. And the barkeep who is standing there is, "Right." And then goes back to the bar, gathers the rest of your drinks and brings them slowly over to your table and passes them out. "All right, got a second shiraz, for you there, sir. We've got a whiskey, and a whiskey. We got an ale and a meat pie for you. And you, well--" (laughs) He brings up these two mugs. They're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and handcrafted, and he sloshes them up to you and as you see inside, most ale has a good liquidy content. This has a very syrupy thick texture to it. He slides both forward and goes, "I don't expect you to drink both those back to back."
Ashley: Well, that's not up for you to decide, my friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean, your drink is here.
Liam: Yeah, and Sarenrae will know if you drink it before I get back, so just hold onto it for me.
Ashley: Well, I can't make any promises.
Matt: And he leans forward and goes, "This here is the Change-Bringer's Nectar. You sip this, slowly."
Laura: The Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Marisha: Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands--
Matt: Well, you guys are all at the same table now.
Marisha: Oh, we're at the same table now?
Matt: Yeah, one table got up as soon as you sat down.
Marisha: Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an Enhance Ability on her charisma.
Laura: Ooh! I'll take that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You get advantage--
Laura: On charisma checks?
Marisha: Yeah. On checks.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: Her cleavage gets a little nicer.
Laura: It can't get any nicer than it already is.
Taliesin: Very fair.
Liam: All said out loud.
Taliesin: Pike, which one of those two is Vax's? Which one of those two belongs to Vax?
Ashley: This one.
Taliesin: Oh that one? I'm taking a sip of it.
Ashley: Take a sip. It's very thick.
Matt: It's very thick, and it's sweeter than you expected, but it has a definite burn that grows and grows after drinking it. It's syrupy, but because of its syrupy texture, as it goes down it also coats and numbs everything as it touches.
Liam: Percy, I saw that. You have to buy me a whole other drink.
Taliesin: That's fine. I put my whiskey in its place and take the whole cup.
Liam: No motherfucker, that's not what I said! I want to drink that one and the one after it! Oh, you don't want to start with me, Fredrickstein.
Travis: Are you sipping it?
Ashley: I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals do. Enjoying it how he told me.
Matt: And you get the sense it's probably a good thing.
Ashley: It burns!
Matt: It's almost like maple syrup Everclear.
Ashley: Ugh!
Laura: Gross!
Travis: How's my meat pie?
Matt: Meat pie's pretty good!
Travis: This is pretty good!
Laura: That makes me want an empanada right now.
Liam: Role-playing, guys.
Matt: Sadly, no empanadas in Deastok.
Sam: Why isn't he coming over here? Should we send another drink? Maybe two this time.
Laura: He's in the middle of a conversation right now.
Taliesin: He has to sit and enjoy his drink.
Laura: Let him take some time.
Ashley: (slurring words) Should we sent him a Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no!
Laura: Oh no, Pike!
Ashley: (still slurring) I only had like three drinks. Three sips.
Travis: Keep going.
Laura: Just tiny sips.
Ashley: They were so small.
Laura: Drink some, maybe some water, too, in between each sip.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe some meat pie.
Taliesin: That's whiskey. That's supposed to be-- never mind. Go ahead.
Marisha: Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired. Can I do a check to see?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Marisha: Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know gods!
Ashley: Let me see if I know. Will I know the Change-Bringer?
Marisha: Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely have zero idea.
Ashley: I'm going to see if I can think of it. 14.
Matt: It's really not that hard. The Change-Bringer is Avandra. Avandra, one of the gods of the pantheon.
Marisha: Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that.
Matt: The Change-Bringer is the deity that looks over luck, looks over adventure, travel, the open road. That's as much as you can glean from your passing knowledge of the deity. Since you are not a woman of faith, obviously, you don't know much beyond that.
Marisha: It just sounded fancy.
Ashley: It sounded so fancy.
Matt: She's also known as "she who makes the path."
Laura: Hey, Tary.
Sam: Yes? Is it time? Should I go over there?
Laura: Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm trying to tell you right now. Stop being so weird.
Ashley: Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Laura: It might actually help you just a little bit.
Taliesin: Do what we do any time there's trouble. Sit down, pay attention, and do everything she says.
Laura: And don't look sneaky.
Taliesin: Have a sip of this. It'll help.
Laura: Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A little sip, it's always good to relax your nerves.
Sam: All right.
Ashley: Loosey-goosey.
Sam: I'll take my helm and cock it to the side.
Laura: Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel like I'm on a listing ship.
Travis: What's your confident face look like? More tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow on the right side.
Laura: Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks over here. I also want to see if I can catch his lips and see what he's talking about over on the side there.
Liam: And I would like to look around the room and make sure that other people aren't watching us, or if so, where in the bar they are.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: And I would like to make my way over to the goliath woman.
Matt: Okay. So as you begin walking in that direction, Vex. Couple things. One, you notice that Korshad, while he seems to be mostly being talked at or at least just listening to a conversation, when he does speak, he leans in and does this.
Laura: Of course he fucking does.
Matt: You get the sense he's a very guarded man and this is not his first rodeo. He speaks through his fingers.
Laura: I do, too!
Matt: But he doesn't appear to look over at your table again. He seems to have acknowledged the drink, is enjoying it slowly, and is back enthralled by the conversation at his table. What did you roll?
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. And what did you say you were going to do?
Marisha: Mimic Vex.
Matt: Okay. You both cover your mouths.
Laura: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm following your lead.
Laura: You don't have to do that.
Taliesin: Does this one still work? We can do this one.
Laura: Yeah, that one's good. Just this.
Ashley: Is this good?
Laura: That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's definitely going to come over and talk to us now, I can feel it. We're so cool.
Taliesin: This is a lot of drink that I seem to have taken on.
Matt: Vax. Glancing about the chamber, remember I said there was a secondary platform, that didn't have any doorways to rooms, but there was just the upper walkway across the room both ways? There are about six figures on each one.
Liam: Six on each one?
Matt: They're all sitting there, wearing leather armor, mostly covered by a cloak. You glance up and you can see underneath at least two of the cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a crossbow at the ready.
Taliesin: 12 of them? 12 men?
Liam: I relay to the group quietly, yes. Packing. 12 or so above us all, so no sudden movements.
Matt: The music picks up again, Grog, as you're walking over. The next piece is occurring and you can see now that while the previous one had a frenetic tribal beat, this one has more of a scattered, if I could say percussion jazz sense. It tends to have multiple changes. Yeah, if you could. If you haven't heard the jazz timpani before, it's fantastic. It's more of an improvisational piece. You can see where they're each building off of each other, and then one will make a change and the others will shift with it. You don't notice this, because you really don't care, but anybody who had musical interests would be able to pick up on this. But you walk up and you see the goliath woman. Most of the goliath women you've come across, their lifestyle leads to either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair, as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe did. This goliath female's hair is really well kept, actually. It's almost shining, which catches you off guard entirely. She's not tattooed and appears to be in a trance as she's in the process of drumming away, not even looking at the two of her compatriots or any patron. She's spacing out and is currently enraptured by the music she's creating.
Travis: Are there any weapons around her feet or where she's sitting or playing?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: She has very nice boots. And as a man who has made boots in the past, you can acknowledge, those are very well-made boots.
Travis: Me Grog!
Liam: I just love the alacrity that Travis goes to two, three. It's so good.
Travis: You play good!
Matt: The head slowly turns and the eyes focus for a second in the dim, snow-blind looking pupils, and gives you a nod.
Travis: Nice hair.
Matt: Head turns a little to the side.
Travis: I'll be-- if you--
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots, Grog.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots.
Travis: Nice boobs!
Matt: (bang) Big drum hit, and her part of the song comes to a halt. The two other bits of music alter but continue the beats, and she just--
Travis: Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to the group.
Matt: As you walk back to the group, a little dejected, Vax, since you're the one who's paying attention the most at this point, you notice as the goliath gets this small grin on the side of her face and continues to go back to the drums.
Laura: You charmed her!
Marisha: Look at you!
Liam: Nice work, de Bergerac!
Matt: But Grog doesn't see it.
Ashley: I'll be your Cyrano!
Matt: All right. So what's the next order of business, guys?
Taliesin: Is that conversation breaking up?
Laura: That's what I planned on doing, is waiting out that conversation. I in no way want to interrupt it.
Matt: About 20 additional minutes go by. Another round is bought at the table, with Korshad still slowly, very carefully sipping the drink that you guys bought for him. Doesn't appear to be slowing, doesn't appear to be breaking. You can keep waiting if you want.
Laura: I want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is.
Sam: You mean the Korshad drink?
Laura: I want one of the Korshad drinks.
Matt: One of the Korshad drinks, okay.
Taliesin: I would assume you've already had this stuff at this point. We've been sharing a cup around. This is too much for a human being to handle.
Matt: Do you go to the bar?
Laura: I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his name, do we? The bartender's name?
Matt: You haven't asked him yet, no. There are a few barhands that walk around, but the one you've been going with, you can go ahead and catch his eye as you go through the area. "Hey, do you need something?"
Laura: Of course, darling. I didn't catch your name.
Matt: "Oh! Wence."
Laura: Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there, that you brought to our friend?
Matt: "Oh, you want Schlond's Embrace. Okay. If you're sure about that."
Laura: I don't know, what is it?
Matt: "It's an acquired taste. It's made from a very long-distilled, 40-year processing of a heavy mint leaf, and that, when it's been very thickly fermented, is mixed in with this very sour port base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted until it's become almost thick in its own right. That's mixed together with a few other sugars and a bit of a special fruit. Honestly, I think it tastes pretty shitty, but it's what he likes."
Laura: I'm going to give it a go.
Matt: "All right then! Five gold." He goes and makes the drink for you again.
Laura: Slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund, y'all.
Marisha: Need to make some more money.
Matt: However, he does not bring it in the same glass. He brings it in a regular glass. You get the sense that the glass that was filled was his own. But it's delivered and it's different. It almost has a weird, mushroomy flavor to it. The fermentations involved in the processing of this is not the type of alcohol you'd expect. It's a little musty. But it's functional, and it has an aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint, like a wintergreen afterwards. It's a very strange mixture.
Laura: It's like brushing your teeth, only you get drunk.
Matt: Yeah, kind of. In fact, elements of it taste like having orange juice after brushing your teeth.
Laura: Foul.
Matt: Yeah. It's a little rough at times.
Marisha: What are you learning about the man by what he drinks?
Laura: I'm learning that he probably has minty fresh breath.
Marisha: Oh, really?
Ashley: Maybe you should cheers him from afar so he can see you're drinking it.
Laura: Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup.
Marisha: They didn't give you the same cup?
Travis: I have nice cups. Do you want a jewel-encrusted chalice?
Laura: Do you have one?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Pull it out.
Travis: I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice.
Laura: Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you do, in your fucking Bag of Holding?
Travis: Not anymore, it's getting marked off now.
Laura: Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out, pour it in.
Taliesin: The interior of that bag looks like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. It's a little weird in there.
Matt: It is a silver and pewter chalice that contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded along the sides, going to the base.
Laura: This is gorgeous.
Matt: Lil' Jon would be proud. It's beautiful.
Laura: Taryon. You drink out of this one.
Sam: That drink?
Laura: Yeah, you're the one that bought him the drink. Look like you're drinking it, too.
Sam: All right. Pinky out.
Laura: How is it? Do you like it?
Sam: I love it. (whispers) It's terrible.
Laura: I know.
Sam: I'll just laugh, way too loud. (laughs) And then she said to me, that's not armor!
Matt: Another 20 or so minutes pass in the tavern.
Matt: Some folks have entered since then, some have left. The patrons that are here don't seem to be-- there isn't a lot of switching in and out. Seems like most of the folks here come here fairly often at the end of the day, whether to go about their business or to unwind. But no one seems to be approaching you, no one's crossing your path.
Marisha: I'm so bored.
Laura: Can I go over and talk to Wence one more time?
Matt: Sure. You catch his attention. He comes back to the table as you step up and start in his direction, he goes, "Hey. Another round, eh?"
Laura: Actually, no. I give him five gold.
Matt: "All right. You want another one?"
Laura: No, I'd rather not. No, I was just wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually hangs out here every night?
Matt: "Varies. Easily probably another hour or so."
Laura: Always with the same company, or different people?
Matt: "Varies. They've been here most of the afternoon."
Laura: Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who bought him the drink would love a moment of his time.
Matt: "Oh, all right."
Laura: Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the name.
Matt: "Okay. I will." He looks at the gold and goes, "All right. I will."
Laura: No rush. But make sure it happens.
Matt: You see he noticeably gets a little nervous. Walks over. Do you go back to your table to join your compatriots? Okay. As you're watching, he actually has to psych himself up. He approaches and then turns around and stops for a second, and goes up to the table again and stops himself and gets the gumption up this time and goes to the table. And you see him talking to Korshad, who at this point has his hand on the tip of the drink, glances up at him. Looks over at the table again.
Laura: I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad.
Matt: You see a smile creep slowly across Korshad's face. Puts his hand up and immediately you can watch as Wence, who's in the middle of talking and expressing this goes, "Yes." And quickly darts away. Korshad gives a point to the rest of the guys and you watch his lips say, "Excuse me a moment." He stands up.
Sam: Make some room. Grog, leave!
Marisha: I scoot with Grog.
Travis: We get up. I get up.
Marisha: I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to pee. Do you want to go pee?
Matt: As Korshad's walking across the room, Vax, you do watch as all the individuals that are on the upper platform all watch him go through the room and are now seeing the table and where they are standing. The attention is very strongly on what is about to transpire.
Liam: So far just eyes, though?
Marisha: Yeah, I start paying attention to the room as well, with Grog.
Liam: Grand Poobah, here.
Laura: You said that over the earring?
Liam: That was Liam.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Korshad walks his way over to the table and you can see, as he walks through, occasionally somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him him. Very quickly to you, you get the sense that he's definitely one of the more powerful figures that seems to come in and out of this establishment. He approaches the edge of the table, still holding the cup from the upper lip. There's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in front of him, and he occasionally sips from it that way as he walks towards you. Comes up to the edge of the table. "Do you mind if I sit here?"
Laura: Oh please, join us.
Matt: He sits down and places the cup on the table. (muffled) "So." (laughter)
Matt: "My man Wence tells me that you are requesting my presence."
Laura: Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the whole time. Okay?
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Laura: I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here.
Sam: Taryon Darrington, of the Darrington family.
Matt: I have not had the pleasure, but I know of you.
Laura: And you are familiar with his father as well?
Matt: "Quite."
Laura: We've heard tell of recent situations with his family and you.
Matt: "And?"
Laura: And we were hoping we could come to an agreement.
Matt: "What agreement do you have proposed?"
Laura: Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox Machina?
Matt: "We trade in a great many things. Information being one. And I am well aware of who you are."
Laura: And I'm well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us.
Matt: "Are you offering your services?"
Laura: Potentially. If it could help clear the Darrington name.
Matt: (sighs) "You are not wrong. I, myself, am the keeper of the deeds. I consider the Darrington estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening. You see, our community here thrives on a principle that other syndicates in Exandria lack. Patience. I have been letting this stew for a very, very long time, so if you wish to make any sort of dent in this debt, your task will have to be equally monumental."
Sam: Well, I can make magical items, if there's something that you need made or enchanted. We have other members of the group that do different things. We have a fine tinkerer, if you need something made for you. Vex here is an excellent shot. She could put on an archery show or something, if that would be something worthwhile to you. You know, if that will help ease the debt. I know my family owes you quite a bit of money.
Laura: 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.
Matt: "You are correct. For the time being."
Sam: And might I inquire, as it is my family's debt: what is the timetable on that? Will you be coming to collect anytime soon?
Matt: "I have given your father a date of six months to pay this debt. If it is not paid, then the deeds, as agreed upon many years ago, transition to my name entirely. I am not going to kick your family to the street; I am not a terrible man. But I will be possessing all of your belongings."
Sam: Will they be in any physical danger?
Matt: "No. Not unless they put up a fight."
Sam: Well, I don't know much about you, but I assume you would much rather have the cash than have to own property and manage it.
Matt: "Both have their uses."
Sam: All right.
Laura: So would the Darringtons simply work for you?
Matt: "The family, I will happily give them time to find whatever place they can afford to live or leave the city entirely. It is not my business. However, I will be taking over the farms, I will be taking over the business, I will be taking over the estate. Most of the assets within, they will become property of the Myriad."
Taliesin: Well, there. That's where I think we could come to an arrangement. We're not particularly invested in the power structure here. We're here for sentimental reasons. The estate and just enough property to maintain a modest comfortability. We don't really care what happens to the fortune so long as your family's taken care of.
Sam: Yes, I guess.
Taliesin: You keep your house, you keep your things, you keep a little bit of property to manage.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: What do you think? I mean, they did make this bed. I'm suggesting to you that maybe it is not your job to save your family's power and allow them to keep going as the way they have. But just to give them enough that even if they-- that they can continue with reasonable means. Maybe not necessarily living the life that they were living before but living far more comfortably.
Sam: Even that would be a step up, but it seems like we would have to do something in order just to earn that much.
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so. It's just, there's a difference between saving everything and saving enough to keep them comfortable.
Matt: "If I am to understand you correctly, you are willing to offer your service to us?"
Taliesin: Possibly.
Matt: "And in exchange, we would still be taking the land-based assets from the Darrington name, other than the estate and enough means to live comfortably."
Taliesin: And enough income property for them to be relatively comfortable. Reasonably comfortable. I'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come to a very, very reasonable arrangement. And you, in turn-- well, we could have a discussion about what that would be worth to you. I have no interest in making an arrangement that doesn't please you. We're only here, again, for sentimental reasons. We are not invested beyond that.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Please, god. You've been terrible today. 15.
Matt: He goes, "Comfortable living is a relative thing. To maintain my comfort of living, well, your estate is but a drop in the bucket. But, and I mean no offense--" as he looks about the rest of you-- "Comfortable living for some of you, well, that could be as much as my drink would cost."
Sam: My family would require their main property and all residential rental property.
Matt: "That is not a deal. The residential and the farm territory is to become mine. I would leave for them your estate and enough gold to live a comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on the street for years to come. They could then strike out on their own, start a new fortune if they wish. Perhaps land barony was not their strong suit. You seem to have found other pursuits, maybe you could lead them in a new path."
Laura: And past that point, they would be in no debt to you?
Matt: "Past that point, and a task done in our favor by the famed Vox Machina. Maybe."
Sam: Would they get to maintain possession of their personal property? Artwork, statues?
Matt: "Everything that remains within the estate home itself would be yours to keep. The rest is mine."
Sam: And what is this task?
Matt: "Roughly 120 miles east of here lies a sinkhole. It has swallowed the core of the platinum mines of Herethis a few months back. Now, those mines are a very lucrative point of business for my employers. And every time we've sent scouts to inspect the source of this erosion, none have returned. Many very capable and proven men, unheard again. One of our greatest diviners has since spoken of a powerful force within this mine. Ancient. Birthed improperly. But now seems to grow more and more mad. We're at a loss, so we've put out a contract or two, but nothing has taken a bite yet. If you were to go to this mine, find this entity that has ruined our mining operation there, return with proof of its demise, and we confirm its destruction, I will consider our task complete."
Taliesin: We'll also need some operating capital for this. It sounds dangerous, so we will take the job, but we will need to also charge a very reasonable fee, I think, on top of this.
Matt: "That is entirely understood. And we will keep track of each fee, and we will deduct it from the materials in the Darrington estate."
Laura: If we take care of this for you, it does seem like a monumental task.
Matt: "It may not be. But it would seem to be something of your skill set."
Laura: From what we've learned, ancient beings tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you don't slander the Darrington name. That when they stay in their estate, everyone believes they are still the Darringtons as they have always been.
Matt: "I would agree to that. I have no interests in your family's public image. I believe that damage has been done well enough on your own."
Sam: Yes. Are you sure you don't have a cloak I could just enchant and then we could call it square?
Matt: (chuckling) He takes another sip from his drink. "When all this is said and done, Taryon, we'll be in contact. I think there is much business we could do in the future."
Sam: All right. I suppose we have no choice.
Taliesin: We do.
Laura: There's always a choice, dear.
Marisha: You could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being.
Taliesin: I'm feeling pretty good about this one.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: All right.
Laura: Do we need to decide at this moment?
Sam: Seems like we do.
Taliesin: We will also need all of the information you have on this creature in the mines, and if you have anybody who has access to that--
Laura: The diviner would be wonderful to speak to.
Matt: "The information I have given you is what the diviner has found."
Sam: I'm not going to ask you all to risk your lives for my shitty family, so I will pursue this matter on my own if I have to.
Laura: Good. Yeah. You're going to go by yourself.
Sam: Well, I would hire a couple of people to come with me, but if you'd like to accompany me, I'd be okay with that too.
Travis: We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty funny.
Sam: Well, I mean, you've taught me a lot, so maybe I could do it.
Laura: I think you're good.
Ashley: You won't find anybody as good as us.
Sam: Of course not.
Marisha: You are very skilled in hiring talented mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit.
Sam: I am one for two on that count.
Taliesin: And we do have another mercenary at our beck, if we need. That's actually very fair. You're already one up.
Sam: Should we vote on it then? Grog, do you want to go kill something big and scary?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: Pike, are you drunk?
Ashley: I think you should marry whoever you want. So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I vote yea.
Sam: Twinsies?
Laura: Always have your back, dear.
Sam: Oh, Vax isn't here. Hey Vax. You want to go help me save my family by risking our lives in almost certain death?
Liam: What does that entail?
Sam: I'll take that as a yes. Keyleth?
Marisha: Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye!
Sam: Science bro?
Taliesin: Vex says yes, and I am so in the mood to kill something. (laughter)
Marisha: I think we've all risked our lives for each other at one point and another, so it's your turn, Tary. Welcome to the family.
Taliesin: Cheers. This stuff burns.
Matt: And this whole conversation he's had his mouth covered, he takes his fingers away from his mouth and he takes the drink. "Do we have an accord?" Picks his drink up and clinks it. "Return when the deed is done." Slaps the table and stands up and walks back. And at this point, that you notice, the tables nearby, everyone's been just quietly watching in on this. As soon as he leaves they go back to their business and drinking.
Taliesin: Everyone, on the count of three, we're going to stand up very quickly.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Why? Okay.
Liam: Wait! No, I'm just fucking with you.
Laura: Three! Let's go!
Matt: As you do that, about half the folks get startled by it. The music's still going.
Laura: On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one last time?
Matt: "Hey."
Laura: Most of the people here, are they local patrons or do they come from all over?
Matt: "Most of them are local and come from all over."
Laura: Great. Thank you.
Matt: "Sorry."
Laura: It's all I needed.
Matt: "I just serve the drinks, miss."
Travis: Can I make my way back over to the players?
Matt: Okay. She's sitting there. (drumming)
Travis: Can I have your name?
Matt: (drumming)
Travis: (louder) Can I have your name?
Matt: As she's still drumming her head slowly turns around and she goes, "Camilla." (drumming)
Travis: Thank you, and I leave.
Matt: (laughs) All right. With that, we're going to take a break. Try and get back here in a minute guys, see this next bit of interesting fun.
Marisha: To Camilla!
Matt: All right guys, so we have tonight's Wyrmwood giveaway: this awesome butternut wood and leather dice tray. Giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood. Come on over, jump into the Twitch chat to enter for the possibility to win this, the word for the night is Myriad. That is M-Y-R-I-A-D. If you don't know, look it up on Google.
Marisha: You'll win it if you spell it right.
Matt: Exactly. Butternut up or shut up with your Myriad spelling. All right guys, be back here in a few minutes. See you in a second. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Critical Role. Which, timing works out interesting sometimes. Yeah, welcome back to the game. We had our break. Going to go ahead and jump in here.
Liam: I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.
Sam: (belches)
Laura: Nice.
Sam: Thanks.
Matt: As you guys have found your way out of what seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath the Grumpy Lily, you've agreed to, at least for the time being, to make your way east to this mine, which currently seems to be under the-- what's it called? The Platinum Mines of Herethis. Herethis. Which you, Taryon, you understand. Herethis is a region, a regional forest area over there. The Herethis Wood. About 120 miles east. You guys decide: What's your best means of travel? How do you intend to get there?
Sam: We have to misty there, right? Because you don't know any trees in the area?
Marisha: I could scry on the area if I knew enough about it.
Taliesin: If we misty there we could also camp for the night.
Laura: Yeah, we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back.
Marisha: That's fine. It's 120 miles.
Matt: It's not terribly far, as the mist flies.
Marisha: Yep. I'm pretty fresh.
Taliesin: We can misty there, camp for the night.
Travis: (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah. (laughter)
Travis: Character voice.
Matt: Well, I'll go ahead and by the way, because I totally forgot. We do have a winner in the chatroom. Besolis8926, you won the giveaway.
Liam: You got the Nutter Butter box!
Matt: Yeah, Denova will contact you for your information to get it shipped to you, so congratulations. All right, so. What are you thinking about for travel? You're just doing the Wind Walk?
Marisha: All right, before we leave, is there any type of research we should potentially do?
Travis: Nope. Headlong. (laughter)
Sam: I don't know what we'd be researching. The guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know what it is.
Liam: It's not even nearby, so it's not like we could ask people what the mine is like. It's 120 miles away.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: The mines of "hear this."
Laura: Herethis.
Travis: This is right up our alley. Like this is literally what we've been training for our whole lives.
Marisha: I mean, just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's go.
Laura: I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum Mines of Herethis?
Matt: You guys haven't. You have. They're woods that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too small to be a mountain range and more just large, rocky hills. But there's no historical significance to the location that you know of. Go ahead and make a history check.
Travis: Roll high.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Sam: Oh yeah! 21.
Matt: 21. You do know a number of the large-scale battles that took place towards the end of the Age of Arcanum took place on Wildmount. In fact, Zorhaus, the other kingdom that we were discussing before is largely a badlands, barren landscape because that was where the final battle between the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities took place. And the sheer volume of, the sheer intensity of that battle laid waste to the landscape there, so you have the Dwendalian Empire and the whole western side of Wildmount, which is fairly lush and functional, then towards the Zorhaus Kingdom is, and that whole eastern side of the continent, a lot of it is just barren, cracked, destroyed. But you do know that Herethis, the name, at least, stems from a hero that fell in a battle long ago. You can't recall the specific details of it, but there is some significance to the title or at least the location there to something ancient and old. May have to deal with this time period of entities battling gods. That's the best you can make out. The mines are well known. The Platinum Mines are well known. They're not well attended. They're not a public space, and they're definitely under the control of a number of companies that are shadow corporations under the control of the Myriad. You can see where the connection and the necessity for it to be reopened again is important. Platinum is not a very common metal.
Travis: Anything we should be worried about?
Sam: Gods attacking us.
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Trial run.
Laura: Oh man. No, but really, that's where the battles took place, huh? So this ancient being could be from, potentially--
Sam: Or it could not.
Taliesin: Whatever it is, it's not leaving the mine.
Liam: We're running off on a lark, but we've raked ourselves in the faces before.
Laura: Yeah! If we die, we die.
Sam: Oh god, I don't want to die.
Taliesin: Well, no one wants to die.
Marisha: Well, once again--
Laura: Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say it.
Travis: Don't incant that shit again.
Laura: Don't say it about all of us and doom us to your fate.
Travis: Goldfish.
Marisha: Duty. (laughter)
Travis: Better.
Sam: Before we go, was there something you wanted to tell the drow woman?
Laura: Oh shit.
Liam: If we're talking about what we were talking about before, I don't think it's a good idea.
Travis: Why?
Liam: If you want to go and find him, us, and say hi, that's a different story.
Laura: I would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that he could watch Pike.
Liam: Well, A) he did that, not us, and B) we were all very much friends and happy with each other when he did that, and he is not happy with us. It's not exactly the same thing, dear. But if you want to go with me and find him and check in and say hello, I'd be very happy to do that with you. But to send the woman who threw our friend, drugged, over the back of a horse, and took him off to his family? I don't really want to send her after Scanlan, to look in on him or follow him or watch him or anything him. It didn't sound like his father wanted him dragged back on the back of a horse, and it happened anyway. She doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. Yeah, she's cool. So what?
Laura: I just realized I have the other half of the stone. The traveling stone.
Marisha: That we gave Scanlan.
Laura: I could pop in on him anytime I want.
Taliesin: Or he could pop in on you anytime.
Marisha: But he hasn't.
Travis: If he has it, still.
Marisha: Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean for all we know.
Travis: Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be in the ocean.
Laura: That would be really, really shit if he did that.
Marisha: It would be a massively dickish move.
Liam: That was very smart, Grog.
Travis: Hey.
Taliesin: Wow, that happened.
Travis: In your face.
Liam: Oh. Anyway, my point still stands. Once we wrap up here if you want to go find him I will go with you.
Marisha: And do what? Convince him to come back?
Liam: No.
Marisha: See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's been?
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: What about just a location and she has to stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and stuff but--
Taliesin: We could make her walk first into the mines.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on him and now we're talking about just popping in on him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the lines.
Travis: Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that sentiment.
Marisha: Oh man, Grog.
Travis: Yeah. Yep.
Marisha: You guilted me very hard on that. You made me feel kind of shitty.
Travis: This is Grog evolved.
Marisha: No, you kind of got it right. Just go with it.
Taliesin: Exalted?
Laura: Exalted?
Travis: Absorbed. Yep.
Liam: You done been woked.
Travis: Woked.
Liam: So woked.
Laura: No, but seriously. What are we doing? I don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a mine. I'm not sending her to her death.
Taliesin: I am perfectly content to hold onto that chit for as long as we need.
Liam: Save that for a rainy day. We don't need to punch that ticket now.
Sam: Should we at least ask her to stay in town? For a to-be-determined mission later?
Travis: Well, I think she needs to keep up her employment, right?
Sam: We can give her a little money to keep around, a retainer.
Laura: No.
Sam: I can give her a little money. I might need her.
Taliesin: She was employed. She's reachable through employment. We can just find out how to reach her.
Travis: Oh, yeah, that one!
Sam: She might be gone.
Taliesin: You have to be able to hire her. I'm sure there's a system.
Sam: We have no idea how she was hired in the first place.
Laura: We go ask her how to hire her.
Sam: All right, well then let's do that.
Marisha: And no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year?
Travis: Who?
Laura: Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but outside of that.
Travis: What? Really?! Scanlan does?!
Marisha: She's messing with you.
Travis: That was very mean.
Taliesin: You promised you'd keep that secret.
Liam: She has a mean streak.
Laura: (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep, dear. So many.
Travis: I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time.
Liam: I know one of them. When she farts it sounds like a duck.
Laura: It really does.
Marisha: That's kind of cute.
Laura: We go find-- (laughs)
Taliesin: You're going to fart awkwardly and we're going to yell "imposter!"
Matt: All right, so you find K'rynn. She let you know that she was just around the corner from where the estate was and let you know where to find her, and it's like an open tent/lounge area. She's just currently drinking water and eating a little bit of dried meat, and as you approach, she stands up. She still has her illusion on. She still has her pale skin. You get the sense that drow in general are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking through large societal establishments. "You returned. So what did you need?"
Sam: We have no mission at this moment, but we may call on you shortly after we return.
Matt: "Very well."
Sam: Can we find you here or will you be gone?
Matt: "I have no interest in staying in this city in particular. I generally prefer to stay around Vashlow."
Sam: Where's that?
Matt: "Vashlow? It's to the west of here. About 25 miles southeast of Port Demali."
Travis: Port Demali.
Matt: "If you wish to contact me, you can send a missive to Vashlow, or if you have access to a practitioner of the arcane arts, perhaps a Sending would be sufficient."
Sam: Sending, okay.
Laura: Definitely.
Sam: All right. Well, stand by. We'll call you. Thank you for your time, and we'll be in touch.
Matt: "Very well. It was just business."
Sam: Sorry about your horse.
Matt: "Eh. Fair trade." She gets up and gathers her little satchel over the side of her shoulder. "Until we meet again." She nods and then walks out into the darkness of the night.
Laura: Never to be heard from again because we'll forget that we have that connection. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Let's Misty Step. Let's Wind Walk.
Laura: Misty Step tonight and then that way we can recover everything?
Taliesin: In the morning.
Marisha: Yeah, what time is it?
Matt: You're in the evening now.
Laura: Let's Misty Step there--
Matt: Misty Step is a very different spell.
Laura: Oh, sorry.
Liam: We go 30 feet. (laughter)
Sam: We're going to be windtalkers.
Matt: Yes. All right, so you guys go ahead and transform into your misty forms via the Wind Walk spell and begin making your way to the east, towards the Herethis Wood. Travel is pretty rapid. It's a clear sky. The moon's still pretty-- it's only been a few days since the last full moon when you guys had the ritual up at the top of the mountains with the Trickfoots, so it's very easy to see the details, especially those of keen vision. Rather rapidly, you find yourselves to the outskirts of the Herethis Forest, and after doing a couple passes overhead, you can see there is a portion of the forest that is open, and there you can see there are a couple of stone towers set up. There appear to be large ropes and cables fastened at the edges of what looks to be a large circular ravine, some sort of an entry port, a very large hole in the ground. And as you approach and get close you can see that, while there are two standing towers, there appear to be remnants of two other towers that have fallen in, and looking at some of the cables and the way that some of the equipment is set up, it appears that this sinkhole that he spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway, whether it be a quake or something, a lot of the structure that was placed around the outside of the mine has fallen in, and is precariously being held either dangling over the inside by cable work or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this abyssal hole you see before you.
Marisha: What do you mean by--
Matt: When I say abyssal hole, that's just a descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from this distance. You cannot see anything past the top.
Sam: And it's connected to the Abyssal Plane.
Matt: It is actually a doorway to the Abyss. Hey guys! Orcus tonight!
Marisha: Finale!
Travis: Do we have any glow sticks that we could throw in and watch fall?
Taliesin: Yes, we actually do.
Matt: Have you guys transitioned back to your physical forms to have this conversation?
Marisha: Yeah. Well, we can float down.
Taliesin: If we're doing our little circle, I would say that a little bit of a distance.
Laura: Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to the--
Taliesin: About half a mile away.
Liam: I'm looking for cooties around the outside.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Liam: Cooties.
Laura: Did you get it?
Ashley: No, it's right here.
Liam: Dang it. 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, you start coasting over the edge, and you can see there are broken carts and crates. You can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of humanoid bodies, mostly picked away to the point where there's just slightly pinkish bone from whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that remain, the rest of the flesh and organs pulled from or dissolved. You're not sure.
Laura: I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds would probably help.
Sam: Dead talk?
Taliesin: They don't talk back, but yeah.
Sam: Let's do that.
Travis: Oh yeah, you can do that!
Ashley: We can talk to the dead. I have it.
Laura: We'll land a little bit away.
Travis: We didn't land yet, right?
Laura: Let's land a little bit away.
Liam: Getting some Baldur's Gate vibes here, man.
Matt: So you land about half a mile out, and you guys transition back to your physical forms. Vax shares the information and what he spotted.
Laura: Were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below?
Liam: On the edges, right?
Matt: They were on the edges.
Marisha: And when you mean seared, like acid? Or like heat?
Matt: Like white and pink bone. Like just whatever flesh was on there has been picked off.
Ashley: Like something was eating them?
Taliesin: Can we speak to dead?
Laura: Pike can do that.
Taliesin: Why don't you two misty there, somebody start setting up camp for tonight.
Laura: I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in.
Marisha: I'll start setting up camp.
Taliesin: You can still misty. We're still misty-able. You can fly in, talk to them, and fly back out.
Laura: She can't talk to them as mist.
Taliesin: I mean, land and then--
Laura: Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace, anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in. So I do that.
Matt: All right, so. Is it just you, Pike? Who's going with you?
Laura: And me.
Liam: I'm already standing by the bodies, yeah.
Matt: All right, so you go back to the bodies with them?
Laura: Okay, you're still out there?
Liam: No, I--
Matt: All right, so the three of you are turning back to mist and making your way back toward the entrance.
Taliesin: I'm going to set up the tents.
Matt: Okay. You guys land near the edge of this crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself has curled in and collapsed inward, and there are a number of cables or ropes that go across and various large structures, the stone towers that sit at the edge of this opening. You can see there's tension on these ropes and either the rope's going to snap at some point as the weather gets harsher over here, or the rock is going to crumble in if the ground keeps eroding. You're not sure if it's done, or if it's a slow crawling thing. There before you, you see a body. You can see elements of clothing, torn and dried, crusted with old blood. You see a boot that's left off to the side. The foot's been removed, but it looks like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit. The skeleton's been picked clean.
Ashley: Okay. We only see the one body?
Matt: There are three bodies around the whole exterior, but you've landed next to one.
Liam: When you said picked clean, do they look like they've been chewed upon?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: It's fine. 18.
Matt: Looking at the bones, you can see signs of what appear to be scratches or grooves across the bones... It's interesting. A lot of the bones have a very smooth texture to them. You're used to seeing very porous, but it looks like elements of the bones have melted slightly.
Laura: Oh, gods.
Liam: Slimes, jellies. All right.
Laura: I'm going to get my broom ready. And while Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a hand on her, that if anything happens then I can just take off with her in tow.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you're casting Speak with Dead?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. It's easy enough for you to cast it. It's quick. Ritual complete, you go ahead and you burn some incense.
Ashley: Okay, I get three questions.
Matt: And at which point, the skeleton, which is face down on the ground by the way, the skull (bone creaking) creaks up and looks over. Like, turns around and faces you as it reaches. It curls upward, almost in like an upward dog--
Laura: Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called?
Matt: Cobra position, but the head's turned completely around and curled up.
Liam: Oh, I get down close to it and go (groans) and I flip it over.
Matt: (rattling thud) It flips over on its back and the head (bone creaking) turns back around to its right.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: You get five questions.
Ashley: Five questions.
Marisha: Five?
Ashley: Good day, sir. It's not a good day for you. Sorry.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: It's okay. Good start.
Ashley: What happened to you?
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Something in the mines we found. It hatched. Or woke. And its anger shook the halls. I tried to run, but the skittering beasts got me first."
Laura: Skittering beasts?
Travis: Godzilla.
Liam: That's more than one.
Laura: (whispering) What did the skitterers look like?
Ashley: What did the skittering beasts look like?
Laura: Oh, in my drink?
Liam: It flew away.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a dick.
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Large. Hard carapaces. Pincers. Many legs."
Ashley: (whispering) It's like spiders.
Travis: Umber hulk?
Liam: Umber hulk with many legs.
Marisha: That could be a glabrezu, which fucking killed you the first time. They have pincers.
Laura: Yeah, but that's really big.
Marisha: I don't know. Skittering beasts?
Ashley: Is there anyone else alive?
Liam: Did anything work against it?
Ashley: Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder) Was there anything that you guys could tell of your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or work against it?
Matt: (grunts) He seems confused about what you're referring to. The skittering creature or the--
Ashley: Oh. The skittering creature or the big thing?
Laura: The skittering creatures?
Ashley: Both, because we still have--
Liam: Against them
Ashley: Against them! Against the skittering creatures
Matt: "The skittering creatures, we just ran. I didn't look to see."
Laura: That's already three questions.
Ashley: Okay. Oh god, this is not-- (whispering)
Ashley: How big were the creatures?
Matt: "They were rather large, maybe eight foot end to end. They burrow, they spit. But they were awoken by the smaller one."
Ashley: Wait, he said they spit?
Laura: I didn't hear, something about his spit. What did he say?
Matt: You gather, what he said was-- (laughing)
Matt: No, the skitterers bite, they spit. But they were awakened by the smaller one.
Marisha: The smaller one?
Laura: What's the smaller one?!
Liam: What can you tell us of the smaller one?
Sam: They spit. Maybe acid, probably.
Liam: Yeah, they're smooth, that means they were just like (slurping noises).
Ashley: Is there anything that you can tell us about the smaller one?
Matt: "It was like a baby, and it cried out and everything fell around us. I barely made it out, but the skitterers found me." (deep exhale) The enchantment leaves that embodied the skull, falls to rest, the bones now motionless.
Sam: So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.
Ashley: A baby, like a baby?
Liam: Mandrake?
Matt: I would say, Marisha--
Marisha: Does it sound like anything we have encountered? A nature check?
Matt: We'll say a nature check for both you and Vex.
Marisha: Would I have an advantage with my little book?
Matt: Not for this in particular.
Liam: It will be like the creature back in Stillben?
Laura: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Liam: And we have heard tales of mandrakes, and they scream.
Laura: Yeah, did the pincers sound like something we have fought though, before?
Matt: No, it's not something you've encountered before, necessarily.
Marisha: 19?
Matt: 19, okay. And Vex?
Laura: Nature check?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Do I get advantage because I'm standing in the woods? Six!
Taliesin: You know you're standing in the woods.
Matt: You have heard of a creature that does exist in subterranean and sometimes forested areas, referred to as an ankheg.
Marisha: An ankheg?
Matt: An ankheg. They generally tend to snatch cattle and beasts of burden in the night. They are large and insect-like. They spit an acidic fluid. Some of the things this corpse has described makes you think of that.
Liam: Isn't that what our bug juice is made out of?
Matt: You bug juice is made of sandkheg, which is a desert-based variant of that creature.
Laura: Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they won't bother us because we'll smell like their brethren.
Travis: I ain't wasting that shit!
Laura: Hey, man, it's an idea.
Marisha: So they snatch cattle--
Sam: So we should all be cows.
Marisha: Oh my god, you guys. Perfect opportunity!
Liam: Throwback Thursday!
Marisha: Throwback Thursday!
Matt: If only the person who could cast the spell was in your party anymore. He's elsewhere in the world right now.
Liam: That asshole.
Sam: We just talked to him. He was the dead body. (groaning)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Well, we're going to rest for the night, and then go in at first light.
Laura: Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which-- okay, hang on, let me check here.
Travis: We don't need it.
Marisha: I can do a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: Protection from acid would probably be very--
Marisha: Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Matt: Okay. 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Marisha: What should I ask? What should I ask that we don't already know?
Sam: I mean, is there any nature down there? It's a mine. It's all rocks.
Marisha: Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile radius.
Travis: How deep does the hole go?
Marisha: I was thinking that.
Matt: Instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area: terrain; bodies of water; prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead; influence from other planes of existence; or buildings.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Choose three of those.
Marisha: First and foremost, influences from other planes of existence.
Matt: Okay, so as you focus and Commune with Nature, the plants speak to you in this series of images and thoughts that essentially get the idea across to you that there is something planar involved here, but it's very old and long-dormant, recently awoken.
Marisha: Okay. Planar, long dormant.
Taliesin: Recently awoken.
Travis: If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm going to be stoked.
Marisha: Okay, so something planar.
Liam: Didn't Drez Vina send us to a fetal thing?
Marisha: Yeah, that was our first fight.
Sam: Oh, we can't do how deep is the mine? No?
Marisha: No, I can, it's a terrain question, so terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go?
Laura: Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine.
Marisha: Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the location of where--?
Matt: You can ask whereabouts this thing is.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for about a quarter-mile, and it lies at the very bottom.
Laura: It's just straight down at the bottom of it?
Travis: That's 400 meters, y'all.
Ashley: So it's like this and then the little baby thing at the bottom?
Matt: Apparently, yeah. The whole ground just collapsed inward.
Marisha: 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom.
Sam: We can just jump. We're like gods.
Marisha: Yeah, we're gods!
Taliesin: We're golden gods.
Marisha: It's only a little bit more than 1000 feet.
Laura: Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the ground. It's fine.
Marisha: Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't work in this world.
Liam: Always go earth elemental.
Laura: Always Keyteor.
Marisha: Always Keyteor.
Sam: So what's our last question?
Travis: Something from another plane. We know it's 400 meters down.
Marisha: It lies at the bottom.
Taliesin: How many of these creatures are there?
Travis: Of the crawly ones?
Marisha: Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are?
Matt: One of the two.
Laura: What are ankhegs? Are they fiends?
Liam: They're beasts, probably. They're big bugs.
Laura: Aberrations?
Marisha: How many?
Travis: Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then--
Marisha: That's a problem.
Taliesin: Then this is a stealth mission.
Matt: They are monstrosities, and that's what they look like right there.
All: Oh!
Taliesin: I love Starship Troopers. I'm excited.
Laura: We're about to fight some big, armored vaginas.
Marisha: About how many? Do I know about how many there are? Sensing their skittering movements under the surface.
Matt: Using the nature's essence to let you know somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a hundred. Throughout the network of caves--
Marisha: Because this is a three-mile radius, right?
Matt: Yeah, so this is spread out amongst what would essentially be a subterranean anthill of these ankhegs.
Marisha: There's a lot.
Travis: We're going to need a fast exit. He wants us to take care of what the problem was.
Sam: We've just got to kill the big boss. One little baby big boss. The boss baby.
Laura: Did we understand correctly that it's the baby that cried out is the big monster? The big boss?
Matt: It seems to be the source of where all this started.
Laura: Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the skitterers?
Matt: Or at least brought them to start attacking the surface.
Laura: Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like, there's a big boss and then there's skitterers and then there's also little babies that cry out.
Matt: You don't know. This is all the information you have.
Ashley: But do we know why the baby woke up? What woke the baby?
Laura: No, we don't know what woke up the baby.
Ashley: We didn't ask that? Okay.
Laura: Maybe we should talk to another dead person.
Travis: Nah.
Sam: I don't think they'll know.
Taliesin: I don't think they'll know.
Laura: They're not miners.
Ashley: They did something in the mine that awoke it. And we can redo it.
Taliesin: I think anybody who was there who saw it probably died at the center of it.
Liam: Sorry, we're trying to remember the very first game of D&D we ever played and Keyleth, twins, Grog were there.
Matt: Yeah, that's right. That was what was essentially a dead or stillborn deity. A demigod, essentially, in its own pocket plane.
Marisha: So does it have anything to do with this?
Matt: Roll a religion check.
Marisha: No. I'm bad at this! (groans)
Liam: I'm religious!
Matt: Yeah, if you want to, whoever's having this conversation you can make a religion check.
Liam: Luck of the day. Yes!
Laura: Natural 20.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Laura: No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make myself roll it.
Liam: I got a 19.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20!
Marisha: Shut up!
Travis: She really did.
Laura: It's like Run Lola, Run where she's doing the roulette thing and she's like--
Matt: Okay. You recall a while back that you battled with that entity, you-- what was it called? Crysa-Thul.
Laura: How?
Matt: (sighs) This is all I do with my free time, guys. Make up shit for fun. But that was not tiny. That was a very large entity. Like, to the point where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and crawled it out Akira-style. Everyone kept saying small on this one, so you don't know if-- maybe related in some way? But you're not entirely certain. It doesn't appear to be the same kind of thing, necessarily. Not by the descriptor you've heard.
Liam: Corpse called it a small one, right?
Matt: It called it a small one.
Travis: We're good. We've still got to camp for the night, right?
Laura: Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the things come up out.
Matt: Yeah, the thick forest of Herethis surrounds the mine.
Laura: Oh man.
Marisha: Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?
Taliesin: I mean you can, I mean we've gone to all this trouble, but if we want to add to it. I mean, this is just what we've been doing.
Marisha: Look, I really like elaborate tree houses.
Taliesin: No, I understand. I respect the art form.
Marisha: I can have a rope bridge here.
Liam: Hammock bed.
Matt: We'll say Druidcraft, which is a very localized and cantrip-based magic, you could, over the next couple hours craft a single web hammock. (groaning)
Matt: It's a cantrip, yo!
Marisha: I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones we have or whatever
Liam: A third-grade diorama.
Matt: Yeah. This is what it would look like if you were to build to scale. Okay. So you guys find a place in the trees? Who's helming finding that spot? All right. Go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Laura: 15?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what my favored terrain does for me.
Matt: No, this is exactly where to use it because forest is your favored terrain. This is exactly the kind of thing it would help with.
Laura: I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now. What am I rolling? Investigation?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24. You find one massive tree. The trees here can get pretty big, and there's one thick tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb, and up top it branches out and all the various branches that make up the canopy. It's almost like this little bowl at the very top, just underneath where the heavy foliage descends, and it's a perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher up off the ground.
Laura: Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here!
Taliesin: I'll unload everything.
Matt: All right, you guys make camp. Who's making first watch?
Travis: Me!
Laura: All right.
Liam: Me, too.
Ashley: Oh! Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Heroes' Feast.
Matt: All right. We'll say as a note, this the last of the chalices you have prepared. If you want to do any more Heroes' Feasts, you'll have to specifically go and purchase the chalices or go look for it in town.
Liam: Let's do it!
Marisha: Is this including or not including the chalice that Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of?
Matt: That chalice, while it looks quite delightful, is not worth a thousand gold pieces.
Taliesin: It's from Medieval Times.
Matt: (laughs) It's a little gaudy.
Marisha: It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts.
Matt: Yeah, every time you drink from it you get glitter on your hands and you're like, shit.
Marisha: How do you turn it off? Cover it in blankets.
Laura: Yay, Heroes' Feast.
Sam: We're immune to fear?
Matt: You're immune to fear, immune to poison, and--
Laura: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Marisha, you want to go ahead and roll the additional hit points for Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: Yeah 2d10, yeah?
Matt: 2d10, I believe.
Laura: We're losing our 17?
Liam: Lose our 17 from the speech?
Matt: You do.
Travis: That's why I didn't take them.
Marisha: (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's amazing! It's a nine and a ten!
Matt: So 19 additional hit points to all of you guys.
Laura: If you give us a speech, how long does that last?
Matt: Temporary hit points last until they go down or you take a long rest, I believe. Let me double check.
Marisha: But this is going to be a long rest?
Laura: Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast?
Matt: Well, no. They're different. The Heroes' Feast is in addition to your maximum hit points. Temporary hit points are different. Technically, those two stack. You're about to lose the temporary hit points.
Marisha: But then at the top of the morning, I can give us another speech.
Matt: Should you be so inclined, yeah.
Laura: Tight.
Marisha: Do I have to do it?
Travis: No, you don't. You don't.
Marisha: Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you.
Matt: You can give the essence of a speech.
Marisha: Right, I can do an interpretive dance.
Travis: That's better.
Taliesin: Only if you actually do the interpretive dance.
Ashley: Wait, 19 extra?
Laura: He's giving you a look.
Marisha: A laser light show. With fireflies. It's like in a Disney Imagineer show.
Matt: It's a speech.
Marisha: All right, well, it's a speech.
Matt: You can give the essence of it, but the idea here is just you honing your public speaking skills.
Laura: You're going to get better at it, Keyleth.
Liam: It's like public debate in high school.
Sam: Toastmasters.
Taliesin: I love Toastmasters.
Matt: Temporary hit points. They last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest. Yes, I was correct. Cool.
Marisha: So in the top of the morning.
Laura: Top o' the mornin'!
Marisha: Top o' the mornin'!
Matt: All right. We'll say for the purpose of brevity, because even at your guys' level if you did encounter anything in this forest that was indigenous, you'd splatter it in a round. But you don't have any issues. Nothing really sees you up in the branches. You occasionally get caught off guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting). It's an owl in the trees. But nothing seems to bother you during your evening slumber. You complete your long rest. You still maintain your benefits from the Heroes' Feast, and as morning comes, Keyleth gives a rousing speech.
Sam: Just give us a topic.
Matt: You can just describe the topics you talk about. You don't have to give the actual speech.
Marisha: That's great, because one can only bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy essence of the pork.
Taliesin: Is bacon what we're fighting for?
Marisha: No, bacon is definitely worth fighting for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine.
Sam: I do like bacon.
Taliesin: This is the most Burning Man thing that's ever happened on this show. I'm flashing back.
Matt: Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest.
Taliesin: Bacon. Speech.
Matt: All right, guys. There you go. Take your 17 temporary hit points.
Marisha: She's not a great talker and has never been one. Just want to point that out. You guys all know this.
Matt: No, it's just her level.
Laura: Just add that to the 19 then?
Matt: No, because the 17, once the 17 goes it's gone.
Laura: But the 19 we can heal to?
Matt: It's still your maximum. You can heal to it, yeah. That is the difference.
Taliesin: I always imagine occasionally Keyleth gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from Animal House.
Sam: Matthew, I'm going to prepare some spells that I'm going to inject into various coins.
Matt: Yes, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going to drop another 300 gold and give Vex another Revivify.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: How far can you jump?
Travis: You gave me a Fly coin.
Sam: No, that's gone forever. That's gone. It doesn't last forever. It lasts a couple hours.
Travis: Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not great. Like three squares.
Sam: I'll give you a Jump coin, so that will triple your jump.
Travis: Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen?
Sam: Sure. When you do it. Let's see here. Who needs things?
Ashley: (singing) Jump! For my love.
Sam: Oh no, you guys all cast things now, right?
Taliesin: Not really, why?
Liam: T., give me something! Show me some magic. Give me a doodad.
Sam: Can you turn invisible?
Liam: I used to be able to, but I--
Sam: You gave away your ring.
Laura: Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It was Tova.
Sam: I'll give you a Blur coin.
Laura: Don't you already have that with your--
Liam: That cloak that I gave away?
Laura: Oh yeah, that one.
Marisha: That's the one that Kerr bear took.
Liam: That's right.
Laura: That's right.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) The inventory of the items you've lost to guests.
Liam: Lost? Gave away.
Matt: Lost and gave away.
Sam: I'll give good old Percival a Cure Wounds coin.
Matt: What level?
Sam: Just one.
Matt: Level one. You got it.
Taliesin: Yeah. It will hopefully not come in handy.
Sam: And also I'm going to change my Robe of Many Things to my new Robe of Many Things.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And that's it.
Taliesin: A Vest of Several Items now.
Matt: (laughs) The Kigurumi of Useful Trinkets.
Laura: Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a bad idea? To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom?
Taliesin: I think that's been working out very well for us. It is pitch black down there, though, isn't it?
Laura: Well. We have this method that we used to do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it down. So I can see by the light of the fire on it.
Liam: Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?
Laura: I don't think so.
Sam: Oh! And I'm going to do one more thing. I'm going to pull out a healing draught bottle, and give it to-- no, you can heal things.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm all right.
Sam: You don't need to heal.
Travis: Other people, I normally do.
Sam: I give it to Vax.
Travis: I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every fight. What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's actually true.
Laura: That's true, he does. He does heal people a lot.
Travis: But that's cool, you give it to somebody that, you know--
Liam: Well, he can give it to me. I've got 50 things I can do a turn. It was what kind of potion?
Sam: A healing draught. It's not a potion; it's a bottle of healing shit.
Liam: Oh shit.
Sam: It's 8d8.
Ashley: 8d8?!
Liam: 8d8?!
Liam: I will never give this up. Ever. Thank you. Thank you, Taryon.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: I think that that's a really good idea, shooting an arrow down there.
Liam: I'm going to set the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic.
Marisha: I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex can light her arrows on fire.
Taliesin: So when we're ready we've got something to light the--
Laura: Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first. Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and things come out?
Liam: Well, that is a very real possibility.
Taliesin: Well, then they'll be easier to kill up here than they will be down there.
Marisha: They'll be 400 meters down. I could theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their face, potentially.
Laura: I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll just keep falling, won't they?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: How does that work?
Marisha: That's a weird magic question.
Taliesin: This is why magic freaks me out.
Matt: What's the question?
Marisha: If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll go--
Liam: Does gravity continue to carry it down?
Matt: Drop a what? A Fireball?
Taliesin: Fire a Fireball into the abyss. Will it just eventually stop?
Marisha: Will it keep going?
Matt: Well, a Fireball is a small bead of magic energy that has a range. So if it reaches the end of the range, it has no effect.
Taliesin: This is why magic's weird.
Marisha: But I could Keyteor to the bottom.
Matt: You could.
Travis: We're just spoiled for choice.
Matt: You take half bludgeoning damage when you impact.
Marisha: Yep, advantages to both.
Liam: Dropping a great height did not go well for you.
Travis: Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--
Marisha: I rolled 19, but then you get an additional 17 because my weird speech about bacon.
Matt: Bacon points. 17 bacon points.
Laura: It will make the most glorious bacon!
Matt: To be fair, I've eaten some bacon in my time that's given me some temporary hit points. Just saying.
Marisha: Look, it was inspired, okay?
Matt: Oh, completely.
Marisha: I'm not wrong.
Liam: We will not go bacon-less into the night.
Marisha: Bacon has saved many a people.
Laura: All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire, and I'm shooting it down into the pit.
Matt: Okay. Oracle Arrow. You fire it. It's a big pit. The radius of a small flame on an arrow doesn't seem to light up the walls. It's not bright enough, so it just descends and descends, and the wood is catching and burning, and eventually it hits the stony, earthy floor at the bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a little bit. It's burning pretty heavily, and you glance around the space inside and you can see what looks like some broken mining equipment on the ground, jutting out in places. You see what appears to be some sort of stony platform that is carved, but mildly forgotten or eroded steps, and the rest of the arrow burns up and you lose your vision.
Laura: That was helpful. Super helpful.
Taliesin: Worth it. It was worth it. It didn't cost us anything.
Laura: That's true. I didn't see the great baby beast down at the bottom.
Taliesin: And that's information we didn't have. And now we know. Great baby beast is not at the bottom--
Laura: Potentially. In that small circle.
Taliesin: It's not at the bottom of the topless pit.
Laura: Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A couple of people could fly. We can take the flying carpet down.
Taliesin: Two flyers, plus the carpet.
Travis: The circumference of this thing is massive. The diameter.
Matt: Well, the diameter of the actual hole is maybe about--
Travis: Football field?
Matt: Not quite that big. I'd say it's about 150, 200 feet across?
Travis: Stay away from the walls.
Laura: You think? The skitterers are going to come out of the walls?
Travis: Yeah, do not come anywhere near the walls.
Sam: When we descend, do we want light to be able to see? Or we don't want things to see us?
Liam: Good chance they can see in the dark.
Taliesin: Let's have the flashlights ready, but not activated.
Marisha: I mean, I have a few Daylight spells.
Laura: It may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface.
Travis: You know, if we're not in a rush-- (deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole and see what comes out.
Taliesin: Did your voice just crack?
Travis: Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty.
Taliesin: Becoming a man? Okay.
Marisha: I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to Keyteor down.
Taliesin: I think it's better, especially-- have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port to?
Marisha: There are definitely a lot of trees, yeah.
Taliesin: But there will not be a tree down there.
Laura: No.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Do we have an escape route if we need it?
Laura: We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set of wings. Up and out.
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Travis: Just a reminder that I can't ride the carpet.
Laura: Yes, you can.
Liam: It's a big one.
Travis: Is it? Is it bigger than the first one?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's bigger than the first one.
Travis: So I can get on there with everybody else?
Laura: The only people we need to get on it are Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless Keyleth is out of--
Marisha: Well, I can Polymorph him.
Taliesin: How much weight can the carpet take?
Ashley: I mean, you could technically just go on it alone and I could--
Laura: Hop on the broom.
Liam: We are versatile as shit.
Ashley: Hop on Vax's back.
Matt: Okay, the flying carpet, the one that you have? 800 pound capacity.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: It's you, right?
Taliesin: You're 300 pounds, right?
Travis: No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely over 300.
Taliesin: Okay, so three of us on that carpet  one big one, one little one, and a medium.
Matt: You can fit Grog and one other person.
Travis: He's a big bastard.
Sam: We can take someone on a broom.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'll join you on the broom.
Laura: All right.
Matt: I think you could probably fit Grog, Percy, and Pike.
Taliesin: Yeah, okay then. That solves it.
Sam: Well, then let's descend slowly and quietly? Is that what we're doing?
Marisha: Hang on. Before we go, there's a few things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't want to be a dumbass.
Taliesin: No, this is very clever. I see what you're going for.
Marisha: Hang on. Wait. I might need the book. Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want to take a minute to use my Spire to conjure an air elemental.
Matt: Conjure an air elemental.
Sam: By the way, can I just remind everyone, this whole year I've had one half of a communications bracelet and someone's been watching us the whole time.
Travis: What?
Sam: Remember that thing I found?
Laura: Because you got that down in the fucking Nine Hells, right?
Sam: Yeah. Someone's watching us. For a year.
Taliesin: Oh my god, they're right there.
Laura: That is so crazy.
Marisha: What?
Travis: Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies. All right, this channel's boring.
Taliesin: The blondie channel.
Travis: He's making armor. Ugh.
Liam: (guttural, growly) I want a blondie so bad!
Marisha: I'm going to conjure an air elemental, and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm going to give him a big hug and say, for the next hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going to give him Freedom of Movement.
Travis: What is that?
Taliesin: Target should now spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from non-magical restraints such as manacles or creatures that have grapple.
Marisha: You can't be grappled.
Travis: So I just spend five feet of my movement?
Marisha: You're also unaffected by difficult terrain. And spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
Taliesin: You are parkour.
Marisha: You're parkour.
Travis: I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.
Marisha: Because I feel like you've been restrained a lot.
Matt: As you finish the conjuration with the staff and slam it into the ground at the edge of the entranceway, you watch as a nearby cloud starts to swirl and descend, and you hear this cracking sound as the planar shift between your plane and the Elemental Plane of Air briefly hiccups open and then summons forth an air elemental that (whoosh) rushes down under your control. It is concentration. Keep that in mind.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Travis: Do it.
Matt: So. Two brooms of flying, magic carpet, wings.
Laura: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Taliesin: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Matt: And you are...
Marisha: I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on the carpet? Is there room?
Matt: The carpet's full.
Taliesin: I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the carpet.
Matt: Okay, we can do that. All right, so you guys slowly begin to descend down this heavy, open tunnel.
Laura: This is just the stupidest. We're sticking to the middle.
Marisha: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: Yes. So I would like all you guys to make a stealth check, please.
Travis: Natural 20.
Laura: Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add ten, y'all.
Taliesin: 27.
Sam: 21.
Liam: I rolled a two, but it's a 37.
Ashley: That's ridiculous.
Laura: 39.
Liam: Built into the rules, man!
Matt: Yep, reliable rogues, man. That's what rogues are good at.
Marisha: 37.
Ashley: 28!
Travis: 30.
Matt: 30, okay! As you guys all descend, you get about halfway down the tunnel, and you can hear this occasional echo (clicking). And for those of you that have Darkvision, you look off to the side and you see there are these small openings, these tunnels in the sides, and occasionally you see a large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking) and then into another hole. None seem to see or notice your presence. You continue delving deeper and deeper and deeper. Looking up above, you can see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above you, and as you continue further and further down, those of you with Darkvision, you begin to see a floor begin to approach.
Sam: Don't land?
Laura: Don't land.
Sam: Do we need light?
Travis: No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off the ground.
Matt: Okay. You halt the carpet.
Laura: And we're whispering. We're whispering, but we're not whispering so that people can hear. We're definitely whispering over--
Ashley: Can we see any little creature in the middle of anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too?
Sam: I have some sort of a cloak over my helm, since it emits light always.
Matt: Okay. It doesn't block all the light because it's the Helm of Brilliance. As you guys are being somewhat stealthy going down here, Taryon is still a slight beacon of fire. His helmet just emits a glow at all times.
Travis: Cool. Because insects don't love lights in the dark.
Marisha: I know.
Ashley: 25 for perception.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Okay. You glance about and you can see this opening at the bottom. There's some warping to the earth here. It's one large chamber that's almost peanut-shaped, it pinches in the center and closes around, and there's a small tunnel that leads off and then closes at the end. It appears to be what may have been some sort of mine shaft that has then collapsed on the opposite side, but the center here looks like there's some fallen barrels and chest pieces, and there are pieces of rods and rope and cords strewn about. And there's this ancient stone platform that rises up in the center, and what appears to be some sort of a small recess in the stonework there. It looks like it's the size of a football carved downward.
Sam: I was wrong. It only emits light when there's undead around.
Matt: Oh.
Laura: Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc?
Matt: It is currently not emitting light.
Laura: Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke that thing?
Travis: The ancient platform? No, don't do that.
Laura: Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like a coffin?
Matt: You could probably get closer.
Taliesin: Let's get a little closer.
Laura: A teeny bit.
Matt: Okay. Because you're a ways from it and you have no light down here. Even with your Darkvision, you can make out some details. The closer you get, you see a number of small carvings in what looks like some sort of language that I don't believe you understand.
Taliesin: Celestial?
Matt: You don't see it. It's pitch-black for you, Mr. Human.
Laura: Abyssal? Draconic?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: Primordial?
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Common.
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: That would be amazing.
Ashley: Dwarvish. Gnomish.
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Giant?
Laura: Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit.
Matt: The humans are sitting there in pitch black, seeing this tiny little bead of light above and just hoping that someone's going to give them some indicator.
Laura: Should we cast some light down here?
Sam: Sure. We said that we had prepared our flashlights before, didn't we?
Taliesin: Oh, we have that low-light version! We have the red-light version of it.
Sam: Yes, we do. I'm going to mark off two of these.
Liam: I can get around very fast. Why don't I go look?
Sam: You want to borrow a flashlight?
Liam: I have a flashlight.
Taliesin: You don't speak Celestial.
Marisha: I can also just cast Daylight, by the by.
Sam: Well, that's what we have going in our flashlights, are Daylight spells.
Taliesin: Except they're lensed and contained.
Matt: It's contained, but it's still a single beam.
Taliesin: A beam of red light.
Matt: So you go ahead and get close on the broom.
Taliesin: And just start to see if I can make out what it is.
Matt: Right. You open up the hood of the light, and it immediately beams this stark red beam down on this portion, and you look at it. It is Celestial.
Taliesin: What does it say?
Matt: It appears to be runes of gestation and protection. It speaks of a seed, a guardian for ages to come: Symphior.
All: Symphior.
Taliesin: It's an incubator. This isn't a coffin. It hatched.
Ashley: So this is the opening of-- this is where it was.
Liam: Is it a guard cherub?
Matt: You notice as this pale white light begins to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the other side of the chamber. This light is emanating from some--
Taliesin: I snuff. The second.
Laura: And we back away from the thing.
Matt: You guys begin to drift back on the carpet, and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe ten feet up off the ground, about the same height that you guys were to the platform. And you see there what appears to be a cherub. It's a baby, or an infant, but it appears to be withered and gray, and its arms and legs hang limply, and it has these small, white angel-like wings, but the feathers are tattered and broken in places, and the head's lolled back, and as the glow grows from it, it goes (wheezes, screams) and gives out this heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole hall. You can't help but instinctually grab your ears. I would like you all to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
Laura: Advantage on!
Matt: Which, actually, you are immune to fear, so it does not affect you. However, it shakes the interior and you watch as small stones (thud) hitting the ground around you. You guys, looking up above, you can see that this scream is affecting the structure a little bit. I need you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, that's good!
Sam: Oh, that sucks.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: So we have, up here by the platform.
Liam: I rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't need to make, and threw it away, and thought, "well, I wanted to keep it," and then I rolled again and I got another natural 20.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Whoa, look at that! There's a map.
Laura: Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're right by the baby.
Liam: Where's the baby?
Matt: There it is.
Laura: Oh, that's the baby?
Matt: It's very tiny.
Laura: Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could be saved, because it's--
Liam: When you say saved, do you mean killed?
Laura: I feel bad because it's a baby.
Matt: All right. Initiatives. 25 to 20, anybody?
Liam: 25.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: Who rolled what?
Taliesin: 30.
Matt: Jesus Christ, Percy.
Liam: So what did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.
Ashley: Jeez.
Liam: Wow.
Taliesin: I am going to debate hard how dumb I'm about to be.
Liam: The dumbest.
Matt: All right. So 20 to 15.
Ashley: 20.
Marisha: 19.
Ashley: What did you get?
Liam: 25.
Ashley: You got a 25, okay.
Matt: All right. 15 to 10?
Laura: 12.
Matt: Ten to five.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Travis: Eight.
Sam: Six.
Matt: All righty. All right, guys, we're going to keep this coming at everyone fast, because we're going to make this happen. All right, first and foremost, as this creature emerges and you guys are in your respective places, Percival, you're up first.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You're up here near the top of the platform, where you saw the recess.
Taliesin: Goddamn it! Okay, so I'm far away from that little bugger, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah, it appeared on the opposite side of this double chamber. It's all up from there.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.
Matt: Okay. So you hop off of there.
Taliesin: Actually, no. You're going to move towards it, I assume?
Laura: I'm so far below you in the initiative, though.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fair.
Sam: It's glowing, right, so we can see it even if we don't turn on flashlights and things?
Matt: You can see it, yes, but you cannot see the terrain around you.
Travis: I'm sure we're going to try and talk to it, right?
Sam: Yeah. Maybe it knows my family's name.
Matt: So Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to hop off the broom, activate my boots and activate my gloves, and start running through that little choke point, and I'm going to get as close to and possibly on the wall of that choke point as humanly possible. The other side of the choke point.
Matt: Oh, this side? You can get about there. You don't quite get to the wall.
Taliesin: Okay. I can get about there?
Matt: You can get further, but currently the creature is out of your view.
Taliesin: That's fine. That's as far as I can get right now. That will be just fine. The gloves are charged, the boots are on, and I'm heading towards the wall.
Matt: Okay. That's your turn?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All right. Vax?
Liam: Okay. Boots on, I'm going to arc over to ten feet away from the baby.
Matt: All right. About there?
Liam: Yeah. Where I am, is it straight up, or am I covered over here?
Matt: It's straight up. Where you see the walls are right now, even this is collapsed about here. In fact, I'd say, to keep it easier, I'll say that's a collapsed entrance there. But this is all a straight-up hole in the ground. It slowly funnels as it gets to the bottom.
Laura: Whoa.
Liam: All right. So action, action, bonus action. I'm going to cast Vow of Enmity on it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Then I'm going to throw Whisper at it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: That is a 33 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: I'm going to cast Divine Smite on it.
Laura: Good job! Kill that celestial baby!
Liam: There's a lot of dice here.
Laura: Get all the bacon!
Liam: This is ten, plus psychic damage is 11. That's not very good. 11 plus Divine Smite is 12, 19, plus sneak attack damage. 19, 21, 26, 28, 29, 34, 36, 38. And there's nothing extra because it's celestial, not a fiend.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right. So that was bonus action, action, I'm going to use my action to then just fly away from the fucking thing, a hundred feet away diagonally up into the tunnel where I can still see it, hopefully. I'm hasted.
Matt: Right.
Liam: Movement was to get there. Bonus action for Vow of Enmity. Action to attack, and then my hasted action I can use for dash, hide, disengage.
Matt: Correct. Dash is your full movement, which is--
Liam: 60 normally, 120 feet hasted. I didn't make these rules or these items. (whoosh)
Matt: Cool.
Liam: Diagonally up. I'll fly by my sister, how's that?
Matt: You fly by your sister? Okay. No worries. That ends your turn. All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to use a terrain shift.
Travis: But it's just a baby!
Laura: Oh no! We're in its lair!
Matt: Yep. As you stab the creature, it (gasps). There's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back. It looks over in your direction. The wings flutter once and it brings its arms up, and as it does and you land next to your sister, you feel the air around you begin to freeze in cold. This energy's just (crackling). You feel ice crystals condense around, and both of you feel the air in your lungs suddenly begin to freeze up. I need both of you guys to make constitution saving throws.
Laura: Thanks for coming right next to me on that one. Goddamn it.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Nice!
Laura: What am I doing, a constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: All righty. 19 points of cold damage to you, Vex, and that is nine points of cold damage to you, Vax. And while you manage to pull out of this space of condensed cold, Vax, your sister, however, becomes stunned for one round as your body is frozen and locked in place.
Sam: Do we see any of this happen?
Matt: You watch the air coalesce into this frozen area, and while the broom is still holding you aloft, thankfully, you are standing there in place and the ice falls, clatters, and slams into the ground below you, sounding like the shattering of a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework. Pike, now it's your turn.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: A giant baby rattle that's directly in front of it.
Travis: Don't fight, play with this.
Matt: It's a level two spiritual weapon. Where are you putting the spiritual weapon?
Ashley: Right in front of the baby!
Matt: All right. I believe you get to make an attack with it, then, if you do.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So.
Ashley: Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the baby. Did you do any damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Once again, roll for attack on that.
Ashley: Oh, that's not very good.
Matt: So you roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: 13. (whoosh) It swings, and the creature flaps out of the way and avoids the blow.
Ashley: Stupid piece of dice crap.
Matt: Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Laura: Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my Vorugal armor.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Does that mean I roll again for--
Matt: No, you take half the damage, but you're still stunned.
Laura: Oh, okay. So that was 17?
Matt: You would take nine damage instead of the 19.
Liam: Nine instead of 18 is what you would've taken for it.
Laura: Okay, so add nine back.
Matt: So do you want to move with your turn?
Ashley: No, I'm going to stay.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'm going to stay. Because we're on the carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet?
Taliesin: I'm not on the carpet.
Ashley: You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet.
Taliesin: You can move the carpet forward, though.
Laura: Did Beacon of Hope get everybody?
Matt: Beacon of Hope. The range on that is 30 feet. 30-foot range gets everybody except for the elemental.
Marisha: That's cool.
Taliesin: What do we get?
Matt: Beacon of Hope, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, death saving throws, and you regain the max number of hit points possible from any healing.
Marisha: Sick.
Matt: All righty. That end your turn?
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Death saving throw is huge. And healing is huge.
Matt: At the end of your turn, the creature goes (raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground right beneath the carpet explodes. It peels back as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a column beneath you, splattering up and to the back and over the top of the carpet. I need everybody in this cluster, this ten-foot-by-ten-foot section, to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Not good, but maybe I'm lucky. Oh, am I not in that? Where am I?
Taliesin: You're over on the corner.
Sam: I have no idea where I am.
Laura: You're next to the big white thing.
Sam: I am?
Matt: So Grog, Pike, and Keyleth.
Sam: Oh, well then, never mind.
Travis: Danger sense 18.
Matt: Danger sense 18.
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20 plus, what's your--
Ashley: One! 21!
Matt: Pike's the only one who made it.
Ashley: What?
Matt: Pike, you suffer 21 points of fire damage, halved because of your armor, so you only take ten. Ten points of fire damage.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a concentration check on Beacon of Hope.
Laura: You got this. You got this, Pike.
Matt: Just roll a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Fucking molten lava!
Matt: Keyleth and Grog, you guys both take 42 points of fire damage.
Travis: Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a little while.
Ashley: Fucking fuck.
Matt: The ground below you right now is currently in flames, and you guys have to stick around that space there. The open ground is billowing flame and lava now, and the area around that platform is searing hot. So what did you roll?
Ashley: Five.
Matt: A five with your--
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: Yeah. You lose Beacon of Hope. Sorry.
Laura: What is it? You have to get above half of the damage you took, is that what it is?
Matt: You have to get above half the damage you took or ten, whichever is higher.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked off?
Matt: You guys can choose to stay on the carpet. You pull out of the way, and now the area is just billowing with lava and flame. Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over.
Matt: All right. You took how much damage? 42?
Marisha: 42.
Matt: Make a concentration check. Constitution saving throw.
Marisha: So I have to get over-- I have advantage on these.
Matt: Yes. You have to get over a 21.
Sam: Over a 21!
Matt: A 21 or over.
Marisha: What's 17 plus four?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. You just maintain concentration.
Laura: Good roll!
Marisha: Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I send him over with my staff. It has 90-feet fly speed.
Matt: 90-feet flying speed? Yeah, he gets over there easy. Plops on over.
Marisha: And he's going to go ahead and do a Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make a DC 13 strength saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Nope. This is not a very strong creature.
Marisha: That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the damage on that, yeah.
Marisha: Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19 plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone.
Matt: Random direction, I'll roll for that. Okay. That's going to fling him 20 feet into the five, ten, 15, 20 into the wall right there, and prone.
Marisha: And are knocked prone.
Liam: Stupid baby.
Marisha: Do I still have line of sight?
Matt: To it right now, no. You would have to get off the carpet to go.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and walk over just to where I have line of sight.
Matt: Okay. At the top of your turn, by the way, you suffer eight points of fire damage by the proximity to the flaming platform there.
Marisha: Even though my mantle allows me to ignore the penalties of dangerous weather effects?
Matt: It's not so much a weather effect. It's more that there's a heaping column of molten rock.
Travis: Your old friend, molten lava.
Matt: Eight points of fire damage. And I need you to make another concentration check.
Sam: Oh no, another concentration check!
Marisha: I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because that's eight, so I just have to get over a ten, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What is this considered, Underdark, or a dungeon?
Marisha: Rolled a 13.
Matt: This is considered subterranean, not Underdark. Cavern. All right, so you've done that. What do you want to do, Keyleth? You're over here.
Marisha: Okay. Can I move over to where I have line of sight?
Matt: Yeah, so you leap over and you get line of sight on him right there.
Marisha: Okay, can I do Blight?
Matt: Sure. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: I think my spell level, so 20.
Matt: And it's a constitution saving throw, I believe?
Marisha: 8d8.
Matt: Six plus ten, so it's a 16.
Marisha: No, fail.
Matt: Yeah. So roll your 8d8 necrotic damage.
Laura: Get it!
Matt: Yeah, no. Even with advantage on the save, it rolled a six and a four.
Marisha: One, two, three, four. Give me two more. One more, and another.
Taliesin: I don't know if I have another.
Marisha: Give me a d8. Okay.
Taliesin: And you reroll ones, right?
Marisha: No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14, plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28. 28 Blight damage.
Matt: Nice. As you reach, it's on the ground. It's trying to get back up, and its wings are flapping, and all of a sudden you watch as its gray, withered skin turns dark black on one half of its body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground, and the area quakes again, and you feel the ground shimmy a bit. The ground beneath you, as its last legendary action, begins to give way. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Fucking lava!
Taliesin: Didn't you move? Wait, no, you moved, didn't you?
Matt: Yeah, this is a different area.
Marisha: That's not bad. 19. No, 18?
Matt: Nope. So as you finish casting this and you hear it scream, you cover your ears, and suddenly the ground moves out beneath you. You watch as the actual floor (whoosh).
Marisha: I turn to everyone behind me and I go, aw, fuck!
Matt: As you watch Keyleth plummet into a pit below. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage and the ground (whoosh) covers over her.
Marisha: It's fine.
Matt: Keyleth vanishes. The ground seems to swallow her up. Keyleth, the entire pit collapses in on you, and you're currently restrained underground, and you cannot breathe.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: That's fixable.
Sam: But can you cast things while you can't move?
Matt: I need you to make another concentration check.
Marisha: On my elemental?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Travis: Matt, can you point to where the cherub is?
Matt: I am, because it's his turn. The cherub creature, this Symphior, begins to fly up off the ground and make its way back in this direction, out into the open once more.
Liam: Keeps everyone from getting a good night's sleep.
Laura: He needs a nap.
Ashley: He has a dirty diaper. He's mad.
Liam: It's been a thousand years!
Matt: As it floats upward, it looks over towards where-- let's see, because all it sees is you two. You both are still in the flames right there. It's not worried about the fire at the moment. It sees you, Taryon, and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts its hands up. I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky. Natural 20! Plus one.
Matt: That's great. So you only suffer 11 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Hey, that's not bad.
Matt: As you leap out of the way, you watch as the ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike spikes underneath, and some pierce you and scratch you and you roll out of the way. You barely move off to the side, where now you see this giant, jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up from the ground. All right, that's going to end that attack, and it's going to use the rest of its movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in the corner. That brings us back to Vex. It's your turn now.
Laura: Yeah, I'm frozen.
Matt: Yeah, so you're stunned, and that's your turn.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: You eventually break the ice off at the end of your turn, and you're breathing heavily and trying to get the feeling back in your skin. That's your go. Grog, you're up.
Travis: What does it take to activate the coin?
Sam: You have to slap it on yourself.
Matt: It's an action.
Travis: Yeah? Just an action?
Matt: Which spell do you have?
Travis: It's the Jump coin, three times my--
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It's touch.
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It lasts a minute. It's instantaneous. You just touch, right?
Taliesin: No, is it a bonus action?
Matt: So that would be your action to use it on yourself.
Travis: Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet.
Matt: Okay. You also take seven points of fire damage at the start of your turn, because you're by this flame.
Travis: Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right of the-- just over here.
Matt: Over to this side there?
Travis: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You run (whoosh, thud) land next to it.
Travis: Nice. Do I have any movement left?
Matt: With the run and the jump, you have maybe ten feet.
Travis: Okay. I want to get right up on him.
Matt: Yeah, you're right up on him.
Travis: Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay.
Matt: You have an action, still.
Travis: Oh, I do?
Matt: Well, no, because you said it's a bonus action to do the leap? What's it say on that? Just to do the leap, right? It was the run. You still have an action.
Travis: I want to hit him.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Great weapon master, reckless attack.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: That's a 26.
Matt: 26 with the minus five? Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37.
Matt: All righty. That's your first strike.
Travis: Oh, I get another one!
Matt: You have extra attack, man!
Travis: 11, 24.
Matt: 24 does not hit. It's a tiny size. It's hard to swing at, and as your axe almost catches it, it (whoosh) out of the way.
Travis: Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I just have the two.
Matt: Yep, that's your turn. At the end of your turn, because it's reset back to its ground, it's going to go ahead and look to you in front of it and go (hoarse breathing). Make a dexterity check.
Travis: Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity saving throw, sorry.
Travis: I get two of those. That's better. 19.
Matt: The ground crumbles beneath you and you suddenly (whoosh) fall below. You are raging. It would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage, but it becomes six. But you are suddenly buried and restrained underground.
Liam: Got that slick stuff on you? Crisco oil?
Travis: But that's my next turn. That happens on my turn.
Taliesin: Yeah, you burn five feet of movement to get out of it.
Travis: Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil, though?
Matt: Freedom of Movement. I'll say it doesn't have--
Marisha: That's why I cast it on him, man.
Taliesin: You parkour around the rocks as they try and--
Matt: Well, he's buried in the ground, regardless. That's the effect. He didn't avoid the burying. So I guess you'd just, if you want to use your action to try to escape, you do so.
Laura: You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge and come up out of it.
Matt: All right. That ends that go. Taryon, you're up.
Sam: Me? Oh god. All right. I don't have anything I can do. I will click my Boots of Speed, making me faster, and then I will move. Full movement of 60 feet towards him-- or her. We don't know, do we?
Laura: Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly bits hanging out?
Liam: Is a peeper hanging out?
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: You've got a pretty close look, if you wanted to take a moment to inspect.
Liam: It's a boy!
Sam: We're trying to kill this thing, yeah?
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: I guess I'll punch a baby. It's going to miss, though. That's a slippery baby, right?
Matt: At 60 feet of movement, you're not quite within melee range of it.
Sam: No, I was going to use my Ring of the Ram.
Matt: Oh, that'll do.
Sam: But I'm probably not going to hit, because it's got an amazing AC.
Liam: Got any Luck left?
Sam: Yeah, I do.
Taliesin: See what happens.
Liam: Got to do something.
Sam: Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all three charges of the Ring of the Ram, and punch a baby.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Sam: Eight. Not good enough, I'll use Luck. 13 plus nine? 22.
Ashley: Wait! Can I War God's Blessing?
Matt: What's the range on War God's Blessing?
Ashley: Let's see. 30 feet?
Matt: No, he's out of range for that, unfortunately. Sorry!
Liam: I wanted that baby to be punched so bad.
Matt: As you (ring firing), it (whoosh) out of the way and the fist goes by. Slamming into the wall. (crash)
Taliesin: One day, it's going to be epic.
Sam: It worked once.
Matt: It got you a kill. The marid.
Liam: That little baby just Zatoichi-ed out of the way.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just like, (ring firing). No effect. It dodges out of the way. And now you can see its weird, lifeless white eyes turn towards you once more.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: That end your turn?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: All righty. Let's see here. It's going to go ahead and use another ability now. As it sees that you're closed in, it glances over, and you watch as suddenly, a bunch of stonework just (rushing noise) up in the center of the area, as now--
Marisha: Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A wall?
Matt: A giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above to about 40 feet.
Sam: We got this, guys. Don't worry. Me and Grog got it. Me and buried-Grog and buried-Keyleth, we got this.
Marisha: Wait, you're buried, too?
Sam: No, you are and Grog is.
Marisha: I'm under the wall, right?
Matt: You're underneath right over here. You're on the outskirts of the wall.
Sam: It's just me and the baby right now?
Matt: Yeah, you and the baby, and an air elemental, and a giant sword that's swinging.
Marisha: Yeah, my air elemental is there.
Sam: Oh, great. I'm fine, then.
Matt: But you lose vision entirely, Pike. Just (rushing noise) wall's in front of you. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: So is the wall hitting the roof?
Matt: No, the wall would have to go way high. It's about 40 feet up.
Taliesin: I'm going to run up to the top of that wall.
Matt: Your movement will not get you to the top. Because you only move 30 feet.
Taliesin: How far will my movement get me?
Matt: It'll get you about there.
Ashley: Parkour!
Travis: Like some unmotivated Spider-Man.
Taliesin: In that case-- oh fuck, I've got nothing I can do.
Matt: I'll put you right there to remind us, but you're almost at the top of the wall at your full movement.
Taliesin: Well, then I will burn my action to dash up.
Matt: Okay. You get to the top of the wall, there, and you can now see it.
Taliesin: And I assume I can get part of the way down the wall as well with my action?
Matt: You can get partway down the wall, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I just want to start making my way, I'm going Spider-man.
Matt: So you get about, I'll say, there on the opposite side.
Taliesin: That was definitely irritating.
Matt: That's your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: That, and I'm going to cast Hex on that little baby. And he has disadvantage on, let's make it his wisdom checks.
Matt: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn, Percy. Let's see, it's going to go ahead and use--
Taliesin: That's a lot of actions, this creature.
Matt: It's legendary actions. It manipulates the area around it. Because you are currently standing on the side there. No, you know what, it's going to hold off. It's not going to do anything. Vax, you're up.
Taliesin: I haven't actually technically attacked it.
Liam: I know what I want to do. You tell me what I can do. First thing I want to do is cast Bless on-- I grab Vex, cast Bless on us and Pike, I have a range of 30 feet on it.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Is that bonus? No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I fly straight at Pike and I'm going to lift her up.
Matt: Okay, you immediately take eight points of fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab her. It's like (fire noises).
Liam: Sure. And then is it an action to grab and an action to lift and carry over?
Matt: I'd say it would be an action to grab her enough, and you're going to move at half speed with her.
Liam: Which is still a ton at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: And that's all I need is the action to grab her and movement to go over?
Matt: Action, and your movement there was about there, I'd say you'll get your action and your movement will get you to up above the wall.
Liam: Okay. Action and movement will. All right, then I will leave her on top of the wall, and I will use my bonus action to fly within range of baby, and I should have one action left, yeah? Action, action, bonus action, hasted.
Matt: Right. Hold on, no. You used an action to pick up Pike. You brought her up there, you moved, you have another action and a bonus action. You have an action and a bonus action. But the extra action that you have is from your haste, which means it can be used for either a melee attack or ranged.
Liam: Great. So the bonus action I will use to dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby, though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with my last, hasted action.
Matt: Okay. There you go. Put you down there.
Liam: And that's a 25, which hits, yeah?
Matt: That hits. That just hits, yeah.
Liam: One, and can I dump Smite into this?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah.
Liam: I would like to. There's nine plus psychic damage is 16 plus-- 20, 26, and here comes the sneak attack damage, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 43, 47.
Matt: 47? Nice. As you swipe down to (whoosh) fling Whisper out, it slams right into the chest of the creature and it impales it off the back side and there's the burst of divine energy inside, but you see the divine energy matches its own, and what looks like a blow that would've killed the creature, it's like, (raspy inhale). Turns back towards you, and gives another scream as the dagger returns to you. End of your turn?
Liam: That's the end of my turn.
Matt: All right, at the end of your turn, it's going to use its last legendary action. It's going to use another cold snap. You feel the air around you, familiar, (whoosh) condense, and the ice cling to you. The air in your lungs freezes solid, it seems. Go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Going to use another Luck. 25.
Matt: 25 will succeed, all right. So you shrug off the stunned effect, but you do still suffer the halved damage. 13 points of cold damage. All righty. Pike, you're up. Top of your turn, you suffer no damage, because you got out of the fire. You're at the top of the wall now.
Ashley: All right. If I climb down there, it's an athletics thing?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: Oh, okay. I'll climb down.
Matt: Roll an athletics check. It's 40 feet down. So that's going to be a long climb.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really?
Matt: It's a natural one?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall?
Laura: Just picked her up and dropped her there.
Ashley: Wait!
Liam: She can see and cast spells!
Ashley: I have Feather Fall with my shield.
Matt: You do. So you use your reaction to cast Feather Fall on yourself as you stumble off the side, and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40 feet (whoosh, soft impact) and you land unscathed on the ground.
Ashley: Okay. Is that just my action?
Matt: That's your reaction to do that. With the shield.
Ashley: Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I get to the baby?
Matt: Not physically. It's over here and you're at the base of the wall.
Liam: It's like 50 feet.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: You can get within range to it.
Ashley: So you know what? I'm going to (sings) Guiding Bolt the baby!
Matt: Okay, what level?
Ashley: Let's do five. 5th-level.
Matt: Oh, shit, okay. Go ahead and roll for an attack on that. Wait, is Guiding Bolt an attack? No, is it a saving throw? I think it's a saving throw, isn't it? I always forget that. No, it's a ranged spell attack, so you have to roll to hit it. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will use Guided Strike.
Matt: Because you can do that! Guided Strike, you get to add that to your own attack?
Ashley: Yep.
Travis: Channel Divinity.
Matt: (laughs) Still checking it. Guided Strike. Yeah, plus ten to the roll. That'll do it. 29, boom. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Ashley: How many sixes? Let's see.
Matt: Well it's four levels above that, so it's 8d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys. 18. Oh, wow.
Laura: You rolled a lot of sixes!
Ashley: Whoa!
Travis: She rolled six sixes.
Matt: Six sixes?
Marisha: What do you mean?
Liam: She rolled a ton of sixes.
Ashley: 42.
Matt: 42 points?
Travis: I'm looking at them.
Laura: They're all sixes.
Ashley: We choose to kill this celestial baby not because it is easy, but because it is hard!
Matt: So as you land gently on the ground after plummeting head over heels. (thuds, fire blast) Holding your holy symbol before you, you watch as this beam of condensed divine energy rockets across, and this tiny, floating, withered planar baby (fire blast) gets blasted. You watch as the wings get pushed back. It's holding itself in place, but you see the dark shadow outline as the energy is blasting through it. As it hits, its wings recoil, and it's still floating there, but you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy, because the next attack on it has advantage.
Ashley: Do I still have a bonus action?
Matt: You do. Your sword's still up.
Ashley: I'll use the spiritual weapon.
Matt: Spiritual weapon, you can move 20 feet as a bonus action. It moves up and takes a swipe. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Ashley: Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How is this happening? Okay. Yeah, the hook on the top there.
Laura: That's how she fell off the wall.
Ashley: Ooh. That's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits! Yeah, so go ahead and roll the damage for the spiritual weapon, which is 1d8 plus five, I think, for you. Whatever your wisdom modifier is.
Ashley: Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, that's not a lot. Seven.
Matt: Seven points of damage. It all helps. All righty. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm underground, right?
Matt: You're underground, you are restrained, you are blind. You cannot see anything.
Marisha: (growls) I'm going to go earth elemental.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: I'm amazed he didn't already have it out of the bag.
Matt: And with that ability, you get an earthglide, and this is a non-issue for you. All righty, Keyleth. So you are an earth elemental.
Travis: Damn!
Marisha: Do I have enough movement to earthglide to them?
Matt: What's your speed?
Marisha: I think 60, earthglide?
Matt: 60, earthglide? Yeah, totally. You're moving into melee with the baby?
Marisha: Okay, can I come up from underground, grab them, and then beat them into the ground?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and roll a slam attack.
Taliesin: Puny god!
Matt: Make two slam attacks, so roll twice. It's plus eight to attack each time.
Marisha: That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one, and a four on a second one, which is 12.
Matt: Yeah, that misses. MARISHA; Okay, but that one is a natural 20.
Matt: As you reach up out of the ground from underneath, (impact noise) your fingers clasp around the celestial baby and (whack) slam it into the ground as hard as you can. Go ahead and roll damage on that. 2d8 plus five, so roll the 2d8.
Marisha: And then you double the 2d8.
Matt: You double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and then add plus five. Crit that baby. It's our next t-shirt: Crit that baby!
Marisha: Six doubled, which is 12, plus five doubled, which is ten, so that's 22.
Matt: The bonus isn't doubled. Just the dice.
Marisha: I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five. So 27.
Matt: That's great. 27 points of damage. (wham) Slamming onto the ground. As your hand retracts up, you can see the wings are-- as it starts to fly up, it (gasps).
Marisha: And I just want to hold onto it and be like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight.
Matt: 18 and 17 plus eight?
Marisha: Yeah, so 26 and 25.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one, oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15. For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18 plus two, so 20.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: And he gets flung in a random direction?
Matt: No, this was just hitting it. (impacts) All righty. That's the end of your turn? All right. As it comes back to the entity's turn, it's looking really, really rough. And as part of that, it's going to reach into itself. Its hands push into its torso, and as it screams, (raspy scream) it gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of its chest open, and from the inside, where you imagine it would be a ribcage, it's this impossibly bright light that echoes out in a shockwave, affecting everybody except for Vex, actually. I need everybody else to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: All of us?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh boy. That don't look good.
Taliesin: We don't have advantage on this, do we?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a Resolve.
Marisha: Constitution  that's part of my physical stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con, strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah.
Matt: So?
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22. That succeeds.
Taliesin: 17.
Marisha: 15.
Liam: 24.
Matt: That succeeds. Pike?
Ashley: 11.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 25.
Matt: Succeeds. Everyone who succeeds, you suffer 48 points of radiant damage.
Sam: Radiant damage?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: 48 on a success. Whoa.
Matt: If you failed, you took 96 points of radiant damage.
Taliesin: Wait, that's magical. I have advantage. The cloak wouldn't--
Matt: The cloak doesn't say a spell effect?
Taliesin: Against spells and other magical effects.
Matt: Technically, because it's not a leveled spell, it's just a radiant blast, it would not affect it.
Taliesin: It wouldn't have given me advantage on that save?
Matt: No, it wouldn't.
Ashley: 96, you said?
Matt: 96 points of radiant damage. So Keyleth, I need you-- your elemental has gone berserk.
Marisha: There's no way.
Matt: Aside of rolling a 20. Go for it. Just try.
Marisha: Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do their own thing if you fail.
Travis: What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy, bless that shit.
Matt: Even so, I'm letting you have this opportunity.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: Nope. So as the Conjure Elemental spell fails, the control of your elemental shifts, and now it's aggressively turning its attention towards you and the rest of your party.
Marisha: Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can drop concentration on it and then it will go away, right?
Matt: No. That's not how this works.
Travis: Did you just put--
Liam: A new enemy on the map.
Sam: A new opponent enters.
Marisha: To be fair, didn't it also get affected by the blast?
Matt: Yeah, actually. Roll a constitution saving throw for the air elemental. It's a plus two.
Marisha: I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15.
Matt: The air elemental is actually destroyed. To your advantage, strangely.
Marisha: It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine, guys! It's fine.
Matt: All right, so the entity looks like it's barely hanging on, and you see parts of its internal body falling out from where it tore its chest open. It's going to use a bonus action to Misty Step out of this vicinity over to here. It's going to use its movement to fly high up, almost trying to escape the cavern now. It's up in that region right there. We'll say, here. On top of this. Turn that away.
Laura: Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.
Ashley: Above a fountain.
Liam: It's a faerie dragon.
Laura: It's so teeny.
Matt: All righty. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the wall. I have no idea what's going on.
Matt: You fly up and you see everyone below is wrecked, the ground is charred with some sort of a radiant blast. You watched it flash over the wall itself, like a small, rapid recreation of the intro of Akira. (boom) This big, arcing ball of white energy.
Laura: Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And I'm going to make it a bramble shot.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Ball of vines in the air.
Laura: DC of 17.
Matt: Strength?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: I actually rolled a natural 17.
Laura: Motherfucker. Okay, well.
Matt: But it still takes the damage.
Laura: Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22, plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6 lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark is 40.
Matt: 40, nice! So as it hits, you watch as the brambles try and wrap around it, but it actually flies free.
Laura: Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring, another two fire damage.
Matt: 42 total. You can see more of it's just falling out of its small, decomposing torso, and it's trying to fly upward now, towards the light. It's on the edge.
Laura: I want to try to do the same thing again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Laura: With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Okay, bramble shot again, because I get two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24, plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38, plus ten is 48.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril!
Laura: Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast tonight! That's so gross. And I just shoot the baby.
Matt: All right. As you pull back as it's fluttering up, you take aim and release, and as the arrow strikes it, you can see, the same way the dagger hit the baby, it hits it, and throws it, the sheer force of the arrow against the wall, and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock. As it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out, and it begins to, suddenly the arrow (whoosh) breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to wrap around it, and you watch as the tiny baby arm and wing try and reach out (choking) as it constricts and twists and slowly constrains it until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the inside of the vines. And as the vines unfurl, what was physically there is slowly dissipating into a glitter-like powder. The body dissipating and falling apart.
Laura: I mean, it was an evil baby, right?
Travis: Yeah, nobody likes glitter.
Marisha: Yeah, glitter gets everywhere.
Laura: Should we get out of here?
Travis: (muffled) I don't mean to be rude!
Marisha: I run over to Grog. I'm still an elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental. Where is he?
Matt: You don't know, actually.
Sam: I saw it. I'll point down.
Marisha: You point. I earthglide and I find him.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I can do double damage to structures. Can I beat him out?
Matt: I'd say you could probably, over time, yeah. You have enough constitution to be fine.
Marisha: I don't want to kill him by suffocating.
Matt: No, he's fine. He can hold his breath for six minutes. He's got a really high constitution, so you're fine. You slowly pummel the rock out from his way and pull Grog out from the interior of the stone floor.
Taliesin: Yeah, we should head out and bug bomb the place.
Travis: Don't we need proof?
Taliesin: Grab the body. Let's go.
Sam: There's no body!
Marisha: I go over to the glitter and I get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to-- Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and harvest some, sweep some glitter.
Matt: Okay. So you gather some glitter in.
Taliesin: Really quick, just look around, is there anything of value to grab before we run?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'll look, too.
Laura: While she's doing that, can I just look over the ground and see if there's any platinum deposits?
Sam: We could do a quick mining.
Matt: I mean, there are a number of visible edges of veins.
Liam: Is there 230,000 gold worth?
Sam: Probably. We could stay here for a couple months.
Matt: In this whole mine, there's a lot of platinum, but you have to mine it. And as you guys are having this moment, you begin to hear the loud sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures climbing their way down the walls.
Laura: Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the air.
Marisha: Okay, so I get everybody in the middle. Is everyone ready?
Travis: I need help.
Taliesin: We pulled you out.
Marisha: What do you mean, you need help?
Travis: I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall from the carpet.
Marisha: I go (boom) and I pull Grog through.
Laura: No, the carpet. We just got to get the carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet.
Marisha: Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through...
Laura: We don't have a few minutes.
Marisha: I can do double damage to structures.
Laura: You don't have to do that. I can go get the carpet. I'm right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Go get the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you rush over and grab the carpet. And you guys begin to make your way back up through.
Laura: Are we bamfing out or are we flying up?
Taliesin: I think we're flying up and if we see anything we'll just take shots at anything that's rolling around, if anything is visible. Let's just do damage on our way out.
Marisha: Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out.
Liam: Or we could Tree Stride out?
Taliesin: We can't Tree Stride. There's no trees.
Laura: Or we can Plane Shift.
Matt: There is a small tree growing out of the side of the wall from where you killed the creature, but it's not large enough for that spell.
Laura: But still really cool!
Matt: Yeah, it grows and twists out, like a bonsai curves upward.
Laura: I hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground.
Travis: They're going to chop it down as they mine the platinum.
Matt: All right, so you guys are coasting up through the shaft?
Marisha: Oh, are we just riding up?
Travis: Straight up.
Marisha: Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin heading up through the center column of this opening. As you're moving up, are you staying in the darkness?
Laura: Can you Daylight or something, like up and out?
Marisha: I can. Do we need to?
Taliesin: You know, at this point, it might be.
Marisha: On the top of my spire I cast Daylight.
Matt: Okay. So (boom) this light now emerges from this area, and as you can see now through this cavern around you, there's about a dozen or so of these large ankheg creatures, about every 30 feet or so, 40 feet up. You're in the center of-- you look up and you can see easily the hundred that you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface by the screams of this creature. And as you begin rocketing up with this Daylight spell, you watch as some of them start hanging upward in your direction. You start hearing this sound, (hiss).
Marisha: Are they attracted to the Daylight?
Matt: They're apparently attracted to your presence. It is a line shot. I'm going to go ahead and have, let's see here. Percy and Vex, I need you guys to both make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure you said that last time, before you turned into Chef Boyardee.
Matt: Sorry, sorry, not constitution. Dexterity, my apologies.
Laura: Dexterity saving throw? That is so much better.
Taliesin: Should I reroll? Yeah, I'll reroll.
Laura: Should you reroll?
Matt: Yeah, roll again; it's fine.
Laura: 27.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: Yeah, you both make it. So you both suffer eight points of acid damage.
Taliesin: I want to start taking shots as high up as I can see, I want to start taking shots at these things.
Laura: Yeah, I'll do the same thing.
Matt: There are over a hundred. And they take more than a few shots to go. We'll say you start picking them off, a few as you go, but you watch them fall past you. There's just such a mass number of them. As you guys get up another 40 or so feet, (spray sound) again. From three different ones. All right, I need Taryon, Percival, and Vex again to make dexterity saving throws.
Sam: Natural 20!
Matt: Nice!
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: I'll live with that. 17.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay, six points of acid damage to the three of you.
Sam: Halved to three for me.
Matt: You make your way up even further. You're about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now you're getting to the heavy cluster of these creatures. At this point, a large cluster of them begin to spray all across. I need all of you guys to make two dexterity saving throws. Anybody get lower than a 13?
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: I did.
Travis: I did.
Matt: For one?
Travis: For the second one.
Marisha: Lower than a 13?
Matt: Yeah. That would be all of you except for Pike and Grog take a total of 14 points of acid damage. Both of you guys, for the purposes of this, take 21 points of acid damage.
Sam: You okay there, Pikey-pants?
Ashley: Yeah, I'm fine!
Travis: I'm okay.
Matt: As you're shooting and you hear the gunfire (gunshots) going off, you fire the arrows. More and more of these ankhegs are falling and crumbling off. You hear the (screeching) as they streak past you, plummeting into the darkness below. Even more so, throwing streams out. However, their numbers are starting to thin because you've gone past the thick part of it. Vax, Pike, and Grog. The three of you guys roll dexterity saving throws, please.
Travis: 12.
Liam: 19.
Ashley: 18.
Travis: 12.
Matt: All right. Six points of acid damage, six points of acid damage, 12 points of acid damage.
Laura: How much further do we have to go up?!
Matt: You guys, with the brooms and the carpet, it's not super fast. Putting up there again. You get about three-quarters of the way up.
Sam: What is Pike riding on?
Matt: She's on the carpet.
Ashley: I'm on the carpet. I'm okay.
Laura: You should heal yourself!
Ashley: I know.
Marisha: Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from around us?
Matt: Wind Wall is stationary. It might help with one round of the spray.
Marisha: Are we doing one more round?
Matt: You'll find out. You don't know.
Marisha: If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell to encompass us for one more round.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are heading upward, now you're about three-quarters of the way out. The numbers are thinning a little bit. They start spraying once more. You go ahead and create a Wind Wall that you've been preparing. As you watch, these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid shoot toward you, suddenly a column of wind gets conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the spray into a mist that is thrown back against the wall harmlessly. You're almost to the exit, and you see a handful more towards the very top of this cavern. Keyleth, Percy, and Pike. Make a dexterity saving throw, if you can.
Sam: Pikey.
Marisha: I'm good. 21.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a reroll. It's the end of my resolves!
Ashley: Oh! Natural 20.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay, so eight points of acid damage. 16. Keyleth?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: All right. That's eight points of acid damage. You took the--
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: The eight, yeah. As you guys just crest out of the top of the dark column below, you can watch as the creatures are starting to skitter out from the edges, but you are far above and a few of them are spraying, but you're above the range and it's coasting over and disappearing below. You've now emerged into the night sky, the moonlight above you. You're all fairly beaten.
Taliesin: Is there anything we can throw down there to really piss them off?
Sam: I'll drop a bead of Firewall.
Marisha: Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on there.
Sam: I'm sorry, a Wall of Fire.
Matt: You're going to throw a Wall of Fire on the edge of it?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the place down. Extermination.
Taliesin: Bug bomb.
Travis: I spit in the hole.
Ashley: I was going to see if I could put a Blade Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in there, they can't get out.
Matt: What's the radius on Blade Barrier?
Ashley: 90 feet.
Matt: Okay, we'll say as you come out the top, you throw down the Blade Barrier-- what's the radius of it, though?
Ashley: I don't think it says.
Matt: I'll pull it up real fast.
Ashley: Oh, it does say.
Laura: 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter.
Ashley: Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet.
Matt: Okay, so you can make a wall around the one side of it. Not the whole thing.
Sam: Wall of Fire around the other?
Matt: You don't get to get the whole radius, but between the Wall of Fire and the bladed wall, you blast the opening there. You coast away, watching and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing up to the top begin to (screeching). Eventually, they all begin to burrow back into the rock and stone and vanish. The ones on the surface begin to burrow below. And a calm stillness comes over the exterior of the mines. As you all coast up, hundreds of feet in the air over the forest, licking your wounds. So you removed the glitter and you removed--
Laura: The little coffin.
Matt: The little stone placard. You had to wedge it out, but you got it up there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And that's where we'll call it for the night.
Travis: Nice!
Marisha: That was awesome!
Taliesin: I'm at 57 hit points. Yay.
Travis: Add 100 to that and that's somewhere Grog.
Taliesin: Where were you at? I feared for you, man.
Ashley: 11.
Laura: Oh my god!
Travis: That cherub was a bitch.
Matt: Aw man. That was also created by the chat.
Travis: Was it?!
Laura: The baby was created by the chat?!
Travis: Why you do this to us, chat?
Taliesin: Why you make us kill a baby? That was great.
Laura: That was a really cool villain.
Matt: That was a tiny celestial.
Liam: Like beating up a Kewpie doll.
Matt: Was the prospect of doing something that attacks via the terrain instead of--
Ashley: Was he an evil baby?
Laura: Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved it?
Matt: The actual title for it is Symphior the Withered Planetar. It was essentially a celestial seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a guardian in a future time, almost a Ragnarok-type circumstance. But the land around it became corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis, and then was awoken prematurely. And as such, became this horrible monstrous version of what it was supposed to be. It was neutral, but it was dangerous. It seemed pretty far gone. Thank you guys so much. We'll be back next week with the battle royale. That'll be fun.
Travis: Everybody kill Keyleth.
Laura: Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to kill her.
Marisha: I am going to be looking at all of my spells.
Taliesin: These two have to be the first to go down.
Marisha: What? Why?
Taliesin: Because loot drop.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!
Marisha: I'm going for the machete!
Sam: But Vex, you're my best friend!
Laura: No, you're my best friend. I won't kill you.
Sam: Okay! Like, within five minutes.
Liam: This one shoved my face into lava at the end of the last battle royale.
Marisha: I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: It was pretty good.
Marisha: Then Pike did it to me immediately the next round. I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: Yeah, it was pretty slick. Exactly.
Marisha: Yes, it was.
Laura: Tight.
Matt: Awesome. Thank you so much for watching. We'll be back next week, Thursday, with our battle royale. Hope you have a wonderful night and weekend. And is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. I think we're recording, because my camera light's not on, but nevertheless, welcome. (laughs)
Travis: We're totally recording.
Matt: I'm pretty sure we are. Anyway guys, welcome, we have a fantastic guest who will be joining us later this evening, but before we get to that we have announcements to go over real fast. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by a new sponsor, a fantastic group called Quidd! If you want to talk about that first?
Sam: Hi, guys. Vacation Sam here. Quidd is our sponsor tonight, a fantastic new sticker app for your phone. You can check it out at bitly, that's bit.ly/crquidd. I didn't know much about the company, but Quidd sounded vaguely British, so little-known fact about me, I have access to the BBC archives at home, so I did some snooping and sure enough, I found a World War II newsreel transcript that talked about Quidd, so I thought I would do a dramatic reading of it for you right now.
Liam: Here we go.
Sam: News from the front! This is Nigel J. Creamhutch reporting from BBC London. March 23, 1944 may be a turning point in WWII as PM Churchill announces a new weapon in the fight against those devilish Nazis. They're calling it Quidd, a new app where you can collect stickers, cards and Funko figures on your telephone device. Our lads on the frontlines are already using it! We spoke with Lieutenant Neville Bingham of the Royal Navy. Right, yeah, Quidd's this free app available on the Apple App Store and Google Play, and it's helping us drive Hitler back to Berlin. But it's not just our Tommies. The Reds have discovered Quidd as well! We spoke with tank commander Ivan Bashenko. With Quidd, Russian army is strongest in world. Morale better now with thousands of stickers to collect that can be used like emojis in messages to your friends. Stalingrad will not fall with these cute stickers! Why, they're even using Quidd across the pond! We spoke with American sergeant John Smith, an American Doughboy. I'm John, an American. We American GIs love to collect stickers from brands like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, Family Guy, Breaking Bad, Star Trek, and newly announced Game of Thrones. Take that, Emperor Hirohito! Well, there you have it, ladies and gents. Your British Armed Forces and our allies will defeat the Nazis and win the Second Great War if you go to bit.ly/crquidd and check out Quidd. Good night, good luck, and god save the queen, pip pip! (cheering)
Travis: I'm so glad that's available on the BBC.
Sam: Yeah, it was a weird transcript. I would have shown the newsreel, but it was just a transcript.
Matt: Fair enough. Well, thank you for the update on that, and thank you, Quidd for sponsoring tonight's episode. Really appreciate it.
Liam: Did they win the war?
Sam: Find out next time! (laughter)
Matt: All righty, let's see. Do you have any merch updates at all, Laura?
Laura: There's stuff in the store!
Matt: There you go. Perfect. Good, I like it, thank you. The Green Ronin Campaign Guide. Pre-orders go up on Monday, guys!
All: What!
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Yes, and if you get the book and the pdf, I think the pdf is available immediately, so some of you will have access to actually read the book on Monday.
Laura: Are you so nervous, Matt?
Matt: I'm so nervous. (laughs nervously)
Taliesin: People can actually, in real time, call us when we're wrong on our own stuff.
Travis: What do you mean, finally? They do that every week.
Marisha: Finally? Although you are Taliesin Jaffe.
Taliesin: This is a level of pain I've only dreamed of; I'm very excited.
Liam: Hey. We're so proud of you.
Travis: Yeah, nice job with the words and stuff.
Sam: Hold on though, we haven't read it yet. What if it's terribly written, by a child?
Laura: We'll find out he used crayon. It's all written in marker.
Matt: Probably. Do you know how hard it is to get crayon printed these days?
Marisha: Only if the writers' room dropped the ball.
Matt: Well, I hope you guys enjoy it, so look forward to that. The podcast is now episodes 11 through 20, right? Up on the Apple Store. So you can go ahead and download those, which are awesome.
Marisha: Yep, Apple and Google Play.
Matt: Yes. And those are the ones. Of course we'll have Talks Machina next Tuesday at 7:00pm about this episode tonight, here on Twitch and Alpha, 7:00pm Pacific, with our fantastic host Brian Foster, so you can check that out. Wednesday Club next week for you?
Taliesin: Wednesday Club, we're talking about Comic Con, because Comic Con is coming up, and we're going to try and give you a first-timer's guide to Comic Con: If you've never been to one, what to expect, what to do for fun, and all sorts of things that you could see or do in San Diego. Other than us. Thank you, I was very proud of last night.
Matt: We're not having a show next week, we're going to be at Comic Con. Yeah, we have a week off. So we'll miss you guys next week, but we do have our Critical Role panel on Saturday at Comic Con, it's at 10:30am in Room 6...
Travis: BC... E.
Matt: It's a nice big room. You guys should come, we're going to have silly questions, Q and A, conversations, stories and a lot of funness and some cool surprises!
Sam: Prizes?
Taliesin: Prizes?
Matt: Surprises!
Marisha: Oh yeah, we have some announcements.
Matt: So hopefully you guys can make it at San Diego Comic Con. If you're going to be there we'd love to see you. And last but not least, Sagas of Sundry: Dread. The third episode went up today.
Matt: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Marisha: (perfect unison) Shit's getting real.
Matt: I'm going to marry you. (laughter)
Matt: What's that? Oh that's right, and at GenCon next month we have our live show, we mentioned it last week. Tickets are still on sale for the general admission. We're looking forward to having you guys there, it's Friday evening.
Travis: Yeah, it's Friday evening, 7 30. In fact, we got an even bigger theatre this year. The last theatre had 1,500 seats, we're like, oh, we'll never get that many people, and it went (explosion sound). It filled up, so we got a 2,500 seat theatre. It's massive, it's a huge party, if you didn't join us last year, you want to come to this mayhem. It's so much fun. You don't need passes to GenCon, by the way, you don't have to have a badge or anything for that, it's a standalone thing. There are definitely tickets still available, it's going to be super fun.
Sam: I feel like with that many people we should have beach balls in the audience, and they can do the wave.
Matt: Inflatable d20s to throw out there...
Marisha: (gasps) You can get them. They're on ThinkGeek I think.
Matt: This is a terrible idea.
Travis: It's a great idea!
Matt: Anyway, without further ado, I think that concludes our announcements, and as such, let us dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So where we left off last time. Vox Machina, having finally encountered the Undying King, returned in physical form in the Shadowfell, did battle and fled, quite unprepared for that venture, and gathered some tidbits of information about what Vecna's plans may be. Upon returning and discovering that your disintegrated Vax has returned through some deal he made with his patron the Raven Queen after disintegrating, you decided to go ahead and try and gather more information about this and beseech some of the higher powers within Exandria. Pike talked to Sarenrae and was given the invitation to come visit her in Elysium on the Island of Renewal, and upon gathering your materials and causing a mess in Vasselheim, you got together and went to meet this fantastic Everlight. On her island, you spoke with her. She gathered some information from you, as Vecna seemed to be blocking at least the influence and vision from a lot of the deities, and then gave her blessing unto Pike, transferring you over to one of the other gods that lives among the Blessed Fields of Elysium: Pelor, the Dawnfather. You then walked through the orchards that led to the Fortress of the Sun where he resides, spoke with some of the guardians there, and were led into the center of the citadel, where you met, in the central throne room under the Zenith Tower, Pelor himself. Upon exchanging information, you spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain gods in the battles to come, and were given a challenge. To step up to plate: Vex'ahlia. You accepted the challenge and racing to the top of the tower, the zenith, before the fires could be extinguished in the brazier that awaited you, you threw yourself into the fire, and upon the party speaking on what it was that made Vex'ahlia such an important member of not just your team, but your family, and gave you strength, she was imbued with a blessing of the Dawnfather himself. After which, we left off as you exited the front of the Fortress of the Sun, stepped into the central glade that marks the center of the seemingly endless orchards that surround this region, and Vox Machina, what would you like to do?
Travis: Eat all of the fruit.
Laura: No.
Travis: It was really good. It was just fruit, by the way. Like I said.
Sam: We're still in heaven right now?
Laura: We're still in Elysium.
Taliesin: It's not quite heaven.
Travis: Are there any other gods here that we should curry favor with? For? Of?
Laura: Are there any more gods here? Not that we know of.
Sam: We forgot to ask.
Travis: Did we?
Laura: Yeah. I don't think Ioun is here.
Matt: You're looking at the series of the Sun Tree cousins, one of which you've met, scattered amongst this glade surrounding the central citadel.
Marisha: What a douche.
Sam: No other people? Guards? Nothing.
Matt: You have the guards behind you, the large planetar and deva entities that stand there, armored in their golden plate, after ushering you out, are standing guard.
Laura: Maybe we can ask them.
Sam: Sure. I'll go up to one and say, hello there, big fellow.
Matt: Standing a full ten feet taller than you, practically, the wings slightly bent, the large planar entity kneels down. "Hello."
Sam: Hello. Vacation Scanlan here. Couple questions. By the way, was he one of the ones who fought in there?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh. Do they all look alike? 17 plus one.
Matt: Hard to tell. You didn't pay a lot of attention.
Sam: Okay. Hey, just wondering, a few questions. A: How does one get out of here? Is there a door to another plane?
Matt: "I imagine the same way you came in."
Sam: A god brought us here. All right, cool. Number two: Are there any other like your Dawnfather around here? Any other gods in the area?
Matt: "Across Elysium, there are two deities that call it home: the Dawnfather and the Everlight."
Sam: So we covered our bases. Out of curiosity What are you called?
Matt: He looks very closely, and you get sense that part of its nature is scanning through you; it's getting a sense and a read of you as an individual, and it says, "No one you need to worry about." Stands up and then takes two steps back (heavy footfalls) into place and looks straight ahead.
Marisha: Scanlan, you should remember that line, that's a good one.
Sam: Yeah. I already forgot it. I'm too intimidated. Was it no one or something? I don't know. Well, good speaking to you.
Matt: Still looks out. Doesn't respond.
Sam: Well, how do we get out of here? Can she take us home?
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: She does on the daily.
Sam: I know, but I don't know. They talked about some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and the bad gods in.
Matt: To remind you of what happened last time. There was talking about possibly... or at least there was the Trammel, the Prime Trammels that were used previously to seal the Chained Oblivion, Tharizdun, and that the orchestrator, the designer of those was Ioun, the Knowing Goddess. Ioun, however, has sealed herself away, being a wounded god, long recovering, and the only information that Pelor has of where she hid herself, the key, essentially, is not an object but a person. You're seeking an individual, of which you were given a solar light map of a single small home in a forest ravine not far from a place that you've noticed was near the Pools of Wittebak, which is in the Cliffkeep Mountains.
Sam: Yeah, but there was also a mention of some Divine Gate that keeps people from--
Matt: Well, the Divine Gate is a known existing entity. It's essentially a large gate that prevents the gods from returning to the Prime Material Plane.
Liam: It's like a metaphysical screen door that keeps flies out.
Laura: So the gods can't get in and out.
Sam: Sure, sure.
Marisha: Yeah, the Prime Trammel. Which we now have to get--
Laura: We have to get near the the Cliffkeep Range, near the Pools of Wittebak, is where we need to go.
Marisha: And the Cliffkeep is not too far from Whitestone?
Matt: Cliffkeep Mountains go across a lot of the northern side of Tal'Dorei, from what you're familiar with. Like, we're talking Kraghammer to Gatshadow to the Jorenn Village. There's a lot of things. It's like a big horizontal mountain range that caps the top part of the continent.
Marisha: Do I recognize the city that I can get us to that's close?
Matt: Fort Daxio or Kraghammer.
Sam: Haven't been to Kraghammer for a while, although Daxio might be worth a check.
Taliesin: What's closest to the pools?
Matt: Probably Terrah or the Pools of Wittebak. Those are the two that are closest.
Laura: What is Terrah?
Marisha: My home.
Matt: Terrah's not your home.
Marisha: Sorry. Sorry, Terrah is the Earth Ashari.
Sam: My other home, summer home.
Matt: The home away from home.
Liam: Can you also remind me where my Vecdar made me feel Vecna-- where on the Prime Material Plane?
Matt: Yes. Oh, where?
Liam: Yeah, we talked about it, but I can't remember.
Matt: You did, yes. It seemed to be hundreds of miles northwest of Vasselheim. You didn't sense any movement, but you knew the general direction and distance.
Liam: And that was yesterday.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: Teacher?
Matt: Yes, Laura?
Laura: I was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my Pelor champion piece of paper.
Liam: Oh, she doesn't get to have it now. That's how that works.
Laura: I don't know how it happened! It's not with my stuffs.
Matt: That's okay, I remember what it does, and if you decide to use it--
Laura: You'll tell me? Okay.
Matt: I won't tell you. You tell me you want to use it.
Laura: Oh shit, okay. I'm sorry. I had it, and it's not here.
Taliesin: It's weird how he's so nice and yet it still feels like you are in so much trouble.
Laura: I'm in a lot of trouble, you guys.
Liam: He's calm, but indifferent. Like the Dawnfather.
Matt: All right, so what would you like to do?
Travis: Yeah, what would we like to do?
Marisha: Should we go to Terrah? Check in with them, I guess, while we're there?
Taliesin: Seems prudent.
Marisha: And talk to Pa'tice.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: All right. We ready to go?
Taliesin: I'm very ready to go. This is lovely and everything, but I've had my fill.
Marisha: I will burn my 8th-level spell slot to Plane Shift us to Terrah.
Matt: To Terrah, all righty.
Marisha: Mind the gap.
Taliesin: What gap?
Marisha: Don't worry about it.
Travis: No effects from eating that fruit, right?
Matt: No, you didn't sense any effects from that fruit, at the moment.
Travis: Didn't remove a curse or anything?
Matt: No, you didn't. Nothing really caught you up to speed, in that.
Laura: Are we by those fruit trees again?
Matt: There are no fruit-bearing trees directly near you. The Sun Trees are around you. Further in they do, yes. All righty. Bringing up my notes on Terrah, since that's where you're going.
Marisha: Yeah, I should probably--
Laura: I'm so confused about the order of things. If we go to Ioun, and we don't have everything we need for this Prime Trammel, are we fucked? I know we need godly power in order to imbue them, right? Or something?
Liam: Either here or soon we need to sit and work this out.
Sam: What do we need to bring into the trammel?
Laura: Well, Pelor gave me this. Snap, snap, snap, zip. This. It's a stone and it's supposed to be strong enough to--
Liam: Power the trammel?
Laura: Part of it? Not all of it.
Marisha: We need to collect more, though, right? We have to get like eight or something.
Sam: Wait, it said that?
Matt: You weren't given any indication as to how many you needed.
Laura: But it did seem like this is not enough.
Marisha: Oh no, wait, Ioun was healing for eight centuries. That's where I got that number. Sorry.
Travis: I could do it, too. Five. Five stones of power.
Matt: All right, so as you complete your spell, Keyleth, you step through the base of the nearest tree, possibly the same one you spoke with earlier if you want to be a dick about it.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Let's walk through that asshole. That sounds worse for us. But fuck it.
Matt: All right, you aggressively stampede through the center of this one tree and emerge on the other side from one of the surrounding trees on the Terrah village. There are a number of these pseudo-petrified or dried-out large-trunk trees that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in this area, that have made a lot of the land unable to support large forms of plant life, or at least the trees that used to exist here. So you step out and emerge from the exterior of the village as it domes down into this small crater that you recall seeing before, where most of the village inhabits the central portion, and the village is there before you.
Marisha: What were the shard things called again?
Matt: The shard things?
Marisha: The things we need to collect?
Matt: There wasn't really a name for them more than they're small pieces of essence of the deity.
Marisha: So we need pieces of god.
Liam: Does the little seed of light given to my sister look anything like the little seed that Scanlan and Vax saw from riding the shadow creature in the sky?
Matt: No. In a sense that it's a small source of power of some kind, but what you saw there was maybe about that large on the platform. What she has is bead size.
Laura: Is it this size? Or this size?
Matt: Comparable to each. So you stand outside of Terrah. What are you doing?
Sam: What time of day is it? How tired are we?
Matt: Based on when you left, it would still be probably-- well, you were over in Vasselheim, which means it's getting dark, actually. I'd say with the way the sun has passed through the sky now, you've just gotten past dusk. There's still light in the sky, but it's going from oranges to purples to dark blues on the horizon, and you can see hints of firelight, torchlight and candlelight from within the actual city below.
Sam: Well, what are we going to need on this trip? Maybe we should get whatever supplies we need. Is it far? Are we going to become gas?
Travis: Are we going underground?
Marisha: Oh, to Terrah?
Sam: No, we'e in Terrah. But the next day, we're going to the--
Taliesin: To the pools.
Marisha: Do we want to stay the night here, then? I can't mist us right now. I'm tapped out. Camp here.
Laura: Vax? Can you sense Vecna? Is he still in the same place?
Liam: I can sense him?
Matt: You can sense him. He is, from your current location, thousands of miles from you.
Laura: Oh, hard to tell, then?
Liam: He's still really shitty, though.
Matt: Yeah, very heavy west-northwest direction from you, currently.
Sam: Well, sleep? Do we need to get any intel on where these pools are? Do we need anything?
Laura: We should maybe talk to the people of Terrah? It's not that late.
Marisha: Yeah, let's go. They have a spare room for us.
Travis: Are you the leader of all the people?
Marisha: I'm the leader of the Air Ashari and the Voice of the Tempest.
Travis: Is that a yes or a no? You don't have to fucking brag.
Marisha: No, there's four of us, and I'm one of the four.
Sam: Do you know the one who lives here?
Marisha: I do.
Sam: Then let's go see him or her. Or they.
Marisha: No, we can just go, like I was saying five minutes ago. Let's just go.
Matt: All right. So as you walk down into the village, a number of the guardians step out quickly, seeing an approaching party, however, recognizing Keyleth and her station immediately, turn into an escort that leads you to the center portion of the village.
Marisha: I request Pa'tice.
Matt: Quickly enough, they go and retrieve Pa'tice. You see the elderly form of the leader you've met before step out, the graying hair, the weathered dark skin tones, the long greens and brown leathers that drape off, showing hints of the knees and lower feet, the large walking staff that he carries at his side as he approaches and the headdress that seems to be a combination of thick twines and shale shards that have been woven in, steps forward. "Keyleth. An unexpected visit, most definitely."
Marisha: Kaitiaki.
Matt: "Kaitiaki."
Marisha: Pa'tice, I am so sorry for the late intrusion. We've just gotten back from the plane of Elysium, so we're a little tired. Yeah, we're fighting a god right now, well, more of like a demi-god, so have you heard of Vecna? Sorry, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. Do you have any food? Let's talk over dinner.
Matt: "We have food, yes. You are guests of Terrah. Please, we will provide whatever you require. Come, provide them a meal!" And he puts his hand out and they run off quickly.
Taliesin: I like that people just feed us. We show up, and there's food.
Sam: You've been used to that your whole life.
Taliesin: Not at home.
Sam: I have to sing for dinner. You just say--
Taliesin: Have you ever tried not singing for dinner?
Sam: Maybe I'll get more food.
Taliesin: You might!
Liam: You did have one year-ish where you were on the skids. You did your Prince and the Pauper bit for a little bit.
Taliesin: It's a big vague, but yes. I was on a boat for quite a while.
Travis: Oh my god, can we eat food? (laughter)
Matt: And quick as that, you guys make your way down. It's a modest meal, but it's a meal nonetheless. Mostly hunted creatures of the local mountainside, some dried beets and root.
Marisha: We always try to source locally.
Taliesin: Charmingly provincial.
Matt: (laughs)
Laura: Keyleth, perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger.
Marisha: So the world's in danger, as she said--
Sam: The waiter is like, what?
Liam: Runs out the door.
Marisha: Aw shit! I just induced panic.
Matt: Pa'tice, who's sat down with you, says quickly, "We have been made aware via the other Ashari that there is some danger possibly coming. We are awaiting word of what to do other than keep ourselves in a defensive position. We have to guard the rift, of course. But should there be a call to action, we'll do what we can. I'm unfamiliar with this Vecna, but whatever you plan, please be careful."
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. More than anything, I think I would want you all to be relief for the surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen. I know you have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone like Vecna who could potentially abuse that. But if anything were to happen, I don't know if you could house extra people during a disaster.
Matt: "We are quite good at assembling makeshift and temporary lodging. The rock is our friend, if you will."
Marisha: Yeah, that's more, I think, what we would need.
Matt: "Of course, of course! Not a worry."
Marisha: Currently, Vecna is just north of Vasselheim, close to Pyrah.
Matt: "Have you asked Pyrah for aid, as well?"
Marisha: They've also been put on alert, but we have not personally been there yet since this has happened.
Matt: "Well. Good. They're closer. But we're happy to help if we can."
Marisha: Yeah. Thank you.
Laura: Things are happening very quickly. We just happened here first.
Matt: "We're happy to help. Where are you off to?"
Sam: The Pools of Wittebak.
Matt: "What brings you towards the Pools of Wittebak?"
Sam: You know this place?
Matt: "It is a series of poisoned wells and hulking, stupid giants."
Sam: Hulking, stupid giants?
Laura: Giants? At the pools?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: I thought it was something about gnomes there.
Matt: "It was once."
Sam: They grew. (laughter)
Laura: Is that something you can do, Scanlan?
Sam: I don't know. (laughs)
Matt: "They're geothermic large puddles across the mountainside. Various minerals being lifted up from the deep waters beneath the mountain. Heated, bubbling, boiling, steaming. But the giants moved in hundreds of years ago, stomped around, and ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish city of Wittebak with fumes and poison. Killed most of them, and the rest fled to Kraghammer."
Liam: Do you all ever broach the area or do you just stay clear of it?
Matt: "Best to avoid, we have our own business to deal with. And it's 100 miles from here. It's not much of an issue."
Taliesin: And the pools are naturally poisonous?
Matt: "Well, some are toxic, some are not, but since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the natural formations, some of them have grown toxic or acidic, yes."
Marisha: Do you know if people still try to live there? We're looking for someone.
Matt: "If they are, they're foolish."
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: That's our kind of people.
Laura: Maybe the person we're looking for is a giant.
Marisha: Maybe.
Sam: Do you know what type of giant? We've seen a few types of giants. Do you know their make and model?
Matt: "The dumbest. Hill giants."
Laura: Hill giants.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: "Easy to outsmart, difficult to outrun. They'll eat anything, even small little gnomes."
Laura: Seems like they ate a lot of them.
Sam: (laughing) I guess so.
Laura: Pasty, I have a question. Do you know anything about Ioun?
Matt: "I know of the name."
Laura: But not much.
Matt: "We're not the most devoted people."
Laura: I know.
Marisha: I saw that. (laughter)
Matt: "I can't imagine I'd have any information you wouldn't."
Laura: Okay. Just checking.
Matt: "My apologies."
Laura: This food is really good.
Matt: "Yes! Enjoy your meal!" And he gets up and walks away.
Taliesin: He was so officious.
Laura: I thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there. I didn't realize we were going to fight giants.
Travis: This got so much better all of a sudden.
Taliesin: If it were easy, it really wouldn't be us, would it?
Marisha: So the question is, is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there that is this magical key, or did that person get eaten by a giant?
Taliesin: I cannot believe I'm about to say this. I'm inclined to believe the god. They're in the position where trying to trick us out of leaving is not necessary. They could've just told us to leave and be done with it. That information just wouldn't suit them, I don't think.
Marisha: I'm not saying it's bad information, I'm just wondering who the key is.
Laura: It's possible the key is now inside of a giant's stomach. In which case, it still would be inside of someone. Just a different someone.
Marisha: Yeah. Maybe they're still living inside. Maybe it's like a Moby Dick situation.
Matt: You do recall the map that was shown to you by the Dawnfather Pelor. It was adjacent to the pools, not actually in the Pools of Wittebak. It was within a forest, and was a home.
Laura: Oh! I remember it now! It was a home inside. Oh, I drew a little map of it. Yep, that's it. Yes, it's adjacent to the pools, but there's a home in a forest. Did you like it? That's what my map was.
Marisha: Can we theoretically just mist over everywhere?
Laura: I mean and look out for a home in the forest? We'll have to fly pretty low. I'm assuming the home is going to be covered by treetop.
Travis: We never travel traditionally anymore. I'm just saying, I miss the romantic aspects of traveling the countryside. It's like fast forward, immediate gratification, fucking you know.
Sam: The Dawnfather said we must hurry or else the world will end.
Laura: It's very far. We could Misty Step to the forest and then walk in the forest?
Travis: Why are you fucking talking to me like I'm a child?
Laura: No reason, darling.
Travis: Okay. That would-- okay. (laughter)
Liam: Once this is all done, Grog, you and I will go on a long trek together.
Travis: Yeah? Yeah. I dig that.
Laura: Don't be dark and creepy and make it sound like you're being nice. I know you're being dark and creepy right now.
Travis: Oh, hey. Don't get after my camping partner like that, all right? Shit. Chill.
Liam: Can't predict this one.
Travis: No marshmallows for this witch.
Marisha: It is a little weird to be making promises, though.
Taliesin: Well, on that chipper little side note, I think we should turn in for the evening.
Sam: Yes, do we have lodging?
Matt: Lodging is provided for you. They have a number of various guest tents and small buildings that provide you with space. Not the highest of quality of places you've slept in, probably, and if you wanted to provide your mansion instead, you're welcome to, but ample food, quiet sleep. It's a comfortable evening's rest. You all find yourselves through the evening. As you sleep, and having this being the first time many of you have slept in Terrah, it takes you a while. There is just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on. You get the sense it's probably proximity to the Rift, but there is this slow, perpetual (rumbling). It's like a weird, low rumble. Like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadn't noticed until you were trying to quietly sleep. But it's not off-putting and within ten or 15 minutes, it actually almost helps to lull you to rest. You all come to in the morning, gather your supplies, and are preparing for the next leg of your journey. What do you wish to do?
Travis: Could I attune, either before I go to sleep or when I wake up, to the Dwarven Thrower instead of the Bloodaxe?
Matt: You may. All right. Any other attunements, anyone wishes to--
Liam: I'll set the Deathwalker's Ward to acid.
Matt: All right, to acid. Boom.
Laura: Before everyone else gets up, can I go find where Vax is sleeping?
Matt: You may.
Laura: This is a tent. What do I do? Do I knock? Do I shake it? I'm not sure. Scratch?
Matt: They're lodging made from large pieces of shale and rock, jammed into a somewhat triangular pattern to form an earth yurt, if you will.
Laura: Oi. Vax. Are you naked?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Put some clothes on, then. Jesus. Keyleth, sorry.
Marisha: Keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement. I'm dressed. Yeah. I'm not like that.
Laura: You don't sleep naked?
Marisha: I'm going to go get coffee.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: (laughs) Keyleth darts off in the distance and the two of you are left within the tent.
Laura: Are you decent?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: I'm coming in.
Liam: I'm still naked.
Laura: Ugh, come on! So fucking weird. (groans) I turn my back to him.
Liam: I start putting on the rest of my armor.
Matt: Okay. (laughs)
Laura: Can I ask you a question? Well, I'm going to.
Liam: Of course you can.
Laura: I look down at my feet. Why didn't you ever try to take these back?
Liam: Well, they're going to be yours, anyway.
Laura: Oh, Jesus. You know, the only reason I do things is that I take great joy in irritating you. If you don't show irritation, it makes it not worth it. (sighs) Can I turn around now? I'm turning around.
Liam: I am covered.
Laura: Good. Why are you so calm? You're so calm and confident now. It's weird.
Liam: I mean, I'm on bonus time.
Laura: Is he still cold?
Matt: His skin is colder than a warm body, yes.
Liam: But I'm not Bobby Drake, right?
Laura: What's his heartbeat like?
Matt: (very slow heartbeat)
Laura: (groans) Jeez!
Taliesin: Wow, way to hang onto that one, Matt.
Liam: But look. (slashing noise) I mean, look.
Laura: Is there blood?
Matt: Yeah, he bleeds, and it's a pretty open wound. You watch as the wound slowly seals itself up.
Laura: (gasping) No fucking way!
Liam: Oh, I didn't know it did that. (laughter)
Laura: That's really cool.
Liam: Thank you!
Laura: Wow.
Liam: I don't know, this is the dumbest conversation. This is bonus time. I shouldn't be here. It was the long sleep or come back and help.
Laura: So she gave you the option and then you came back and now you're what? Super? Super half-elf?
Liam: Well, I'm just following through on a promise made.
Laura: And we defeat Vecna and you're done, you're gone. That's it? Instant? Is it like we kill him and you're gone that second or is it like we kill him and you're here for another week or until the Raven Queen realizes that you're still here?
Liam: There isn't really a handbook.
Laura: She didn't tell you?
Liam: When Vecna is destroyed, she will call me back to where I would be right now. I expect everyone-- Keyleth and I have barely spoken-- I expect everyone to be sad, but I wish you wouldn't be so sad, not exorbitantly so, because I--
Laura: Exorbitant? That's a good word.
Liam: I read. Not as much as some, but I read. This is the path that I have chosen for myself and I did it based out of desperation, at first. But everyone dies.
Laura: I know.
Liam: And I think our group has become a little spoiled. We're not your ordinary group of idiots. We have blessings.
Laura: We're blessed idiots.
Liam: Blessed idiots, yes, and I know that we've gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing anyone, but your average farmer or seamstress doesn't come back. And everybody dies, and all that matters is what you do with what you have, and I have done a lot, and I've taken great pride watching all that you have done. And I have good friends and I have fallen in love. More than most, I've had.
Laura: Yeah. After you die, do you stand by her side?
Liam: That I don't really know. I imagine she'll keep me close.
Laura: Do you like her now?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: She's necessary and she's of use, and I like that.
Laura: She brought you back to us for a while. I like her, too. Anyway, do you want the fucking boots back? Fuck! Yeah, sure, yes, fine, that's fine. I wanted to give them back, so there you go. I'm glad you asked for them back.
Liam: I don't have a lot of time. They really are my favorite thing.
Laura: I know.
Liam: Physical thing.
Laura: Just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the Raven Queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe.
Liam: Dear, every stitch on my body is yours when I am gone.
Laura: I don't want every stitch. None of it's worth you leaving.
Liam: I slide my feet into the shoes and I wiggle my toes around. Oh, I'm sorry. I also have a confession to make.
Laura: What?
Liam: I don't exactly have your shoes anymore.
Laura: What?!
Liam: I think that I left them in the Feywild.
Laura: The Feywild?
Liam: Yeah, I think I dropped them into a bog. They didn't fit me.
Laura: You are a motherfucker. You couldn't have just put them in the Bag of Holding?
Liam: I'm still me.
Laura: Great, wonderful. I like being barefoot.
Liam: You have very cute, small feet that fit in the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet.
Laura: That's great.
Liam: There's probably shoes here.
Laura: Probably. All right.
Liam: I pull out her shoes and I put them down.
Laura: Well, at least there's that!
Matt: Got your shoes back. Keyleth returns with some coffee. The rest of you come to consciousness, and the morning sun is now blaring down over the Cliffkeep. It's a strangely clear sky for the north. While a lot of it is relatively cold usually, you're used to seeing the snow- capped mountaintops-- oh, you found it! There you go.
Taliesin: It was with you the whole time.
Liam: Must have been inside your shoes.
Laura: Oh my gosh! I put it in the safe place and I didn't realize it!
Travis: Thank you, chat.
Laura: Did they really know where I put it?
Travis: Yeah, they know where your shit is.
Sam: The chat knew where you put your stuff?
Travis: "It's in the page in front of your blue divider."
Sam: No way!
Laura: Wow, thank you. Thank you, guys!
Liam: How many fingers am I holding up?
Matt: So bringing it back in, guys.
Sam: Yes, we have a guest.
Matt: Yes. At some point. So what do you guys want to do?
Sam: Set off! For the Pools of Hatabah! (laughter)
Taliesin: For the forest near the Pools of--
Sam: The adjacent to the Pools of Hatafah.
Travis: We didn't want to bring any extra muscle with us, do we, from these peeps? Oh wait, we're misting a long ways away. Never mind. Sorry. Forget it.
Liam: Grog, you are our extra muscle.
Travis: See! High five! Up top.
Liam: I'm not dead.
Travis: His hand's cold.
Matt: So you're traversing via your Wind Walk?
Marisha: I guess. Are we wind walking there?
Laura: (mispronouncing) Wind.
Marisha: (mispronouncing) Wind walk? Wind walking.
Liam: (mispronouncing) Wil Wheaton!
Sam: Hey, before we leave, real quick  Kiki.
Marisha: Yes.
Sam: Can you send messages or anything?
Marisha: No, man. We have been through this with our entire group so many times.
Sam: It's just you're so powerful.
Marisha: Thank you.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: What do you need?
Sam: I would send a letter, but it'll take weeks. So forget it. We'll be somewhere close to somewhere with magic soon.
Marisha: We can leave it in the hands of the Ashari, see if they can find somebody.
Sam: You trust these folks?
Marisha: Yeah. They're all right.
Taliesin: They're not the worst.
Marisha: They're not the worst.
Sam: All right, I'll scribble a little note and say-- well, no, there's no way they can get it to-- it's too far! It's too far!
Taliesin: I was really excited to see your face when you handed it to them and they're like, what are we supposed to do with this?
Sam: Here, I'll show you, Grog.
Travis: Write it out, bitch!
Sam: I write, a sphincter says what.
Travis: A. As. Good message. That's a big word at the front.
Laura: You could have gotten the last one, though.
Travis: What!
Sam: Yes!
Matt: Pike taps you on the shoulder and is like, "I'll teach you that later."
Taliesin: Thank you for the Ashley Johnson simulator. That was weirdly comforting.
Matt: Curse you, Blindspot!
Travis: Yeah! Are we misting?
Sam: Yeah, let's do it.
Laura: Should we eat a feast first, or should we save that?
Taliesin: Let's save that.
Laura: Okay. I don't know what we're going to find!
Matt: That's up to you guys. So preparations being done, you gather your materials, Keyleth completes the Wind Walk spell and you all feel yourselves grow slightly lighter on your toes. You concentrate. Over the minute transformation, you turn into your mist forms and take off in what direction?
Marisha: Towards the Falafel Pools!
Sam: We wrote it down.
Taliesin: Falafel pool is actually really tasty.
Travis: Pools of Wittebak.
Laura: Yeah! Towards the mountains!
Sam: He said "which direction?" He did not say "Where are you going?" He said "which direction?"
Laura: We got to look at our map.
Marisha: We have it on the map!
Laura: We have a map!
Matt: Okay! Well, you have Terrah locked down. The Pools of Wittebak would not be on your specific map that you acquired earlier. You can ask around within Terrah within a brief time and figure it out. Somewhere between 100 and 120 miles, and he points in a specific direction. You mark the sun's traveling and where certain landmarks are.
Marisha: I quickly do the math of how fast I can travel and be like okay, it shouldn't take long.
Matt: It's an eastward direction from where you are.
Taliesin: You did actually, legitimately point east, too, which makes that even better.
Matt: That's weird.
Taliesin: Yeah, that is weird.
Matt: I'm putting points in my nature skill. Or survival, I guess. Anyway, too many editions in my head. (laughs) As you all take off into the morning sky, you begin to rocket over, and you're hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find their way over the mountain ranges, and you get blown a little off-course, but you maintain concentration as best you can in that direction. Who is leading this venture?
Sam: I've been there. No, I knew of it, right?
Matt: You knew of it, yeah.
Sam: But I don't know exactly where.
Laura: After listening to everybody, I'll lead the way. That way, I can keep an eye out for the forest next, too, and the house and all the things we're looking for. I got a good look at the map that Pelor held up in front of us, as well.
Matt: Right. Okay, cool. I need you to go ahead and make a survival check. Actually, for this, I'm gonna say-- yeah, because it would be tracking in the wilderness. So survival.
Laura: Survival? Great. Any advantage on that?
Sam: Wilderness is your favored terrain.
Matt: It's mountains, technically.
Laura: That's also my favored.
Matt: Then yeah, roll again.
Travis: Because that was a one.
Laura: Oh! So much better. 28.
Matt: Okay, that'll do it. Your speed is tremendous when in this form, so what would have been an extended trek on foot over a series of days, it takes you mere hours to eventually get to a point where you crest one heavy peak. On the opposite side, you can see down the cliffside, the edge reaches a slight precipice, and there you can see what looks to be for a mile or so a cluster of dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes, all jammed together in a geothermic cluster, where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orange-maroon at the edges from the various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years. You can see large columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools, and at a glance down, you can see a number of shapes: a number of hulking, humanoid shapes; somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 or so scattered at different pools, moving in small clusters or gangs. Some of them are jumping in, cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools. Some of them are lounging around and lying. Some of them appear to be returning, dragging things from the nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank.
Marisha: This is a vacation spot. What's that water park nearby?
Laura: Wet 'N' Wild?
Matt: Essentially, for a few hundred years, you get the sense that the Pools of Wittebak have been a hill giant water park. You can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the pools. It's become a definite hill giant wandering zone. So do you guys continue over the pools, down towards the nearby forest ridge?
Laura: Yeah, past the pools.
Matt: All righty. You come to the forest ridge, and you can see it's not thick forest. The ravine comes down off the precipice where the pools are. You get a few hundred-- I'd say, actually more than that. A thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow. It looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees. As soon as the forest begins, it's a dense little pocket, maybe a mile and a half, two miles across. That's what you've got. What do you guys want to do?
Laura: Oh man. I should try to track any footprints in there and see if there's something around the edges, maybe, that lead back to-- shit, I don't fucking know. It's only a couple of miles.
Matt: If you guys begin to do a loop-over, who's doing a quick pass over the patch of forest? All right, make a perception check.
Laura: It's the forest. Do I get advantage on that one? Perception? What is that, 21? 21.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: Okay. Glancing over, you don't see any major glades or clearings. There doesn't appear to be any sign of bastions of civilization or any sort of logging going on. There's no areas where trees have been cut or cleared. It's a featureless forest top, from what you can see.
Laura: Can we fly down lower to where we're in between the trees?
Matt: You can go down into the forest, if you'd like. All right, who's going into the forest, then?
Marisha: I'll go.
Laura: I'll go. All of us?
Matt: So with Pike following suit, you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and into the center of the forest itself. Within there, it's not a super thick canopy; it's not as heavy as the Feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around Vasselheim. There are breaks in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun that's rising up higher and higher in the sky as you've traveled. The mist has burned away in this area, so it's a nice, warm forest. Glancing about, there is a lot of life in here. You can see signs of squirrels. You rush by what was a family of wolverine-like creatures that are rustling by. As soon as the wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past, they all scatter and run off into the shadows. There's a lot of forest ground here to cover. For you to really super track with advantage, you'd have to go into human form. I'd give you a regular roll if you want to try and track in your mist form.
Laura: Not so much tracking right now, just a loose passover as we're going, looking for any kind of hunting traps or trails, signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot.
Matt: I'd say make an investigation check.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27. Begin coasting through tree after tree through small, tiny bits of clearing that immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at different intersections. After about 20 or so minutes of this, trying to do a large spiral around the forest inward, out of the corner of your eye, Vex'ahlia, you glance over and see a quick glimpse of something that appears to be more structured. You look back and rush over and there you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humble-looking two-story home. You see a small balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor. It's not huge, by any means, and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there. Can't get a lot more detail at this distance, though.
Laura: Okay. We land. I land.
Marisha: I follow.
Laura: And behind a tree, I'm going to take form.
Matt: You take your form? Okay. So all of you land and follow Vex?
Sam: Yeah!
Matt: You all take a minute to go back to your physical forms. You glance over, and there it is, standing before you. It's very shaded in this part of the forest. You can see a little bit of what looks to be interior light, very faint.
Travis: Like a normal person-sized dwelling?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Natural 20!
Laura: Yay!
Matt: It would be a little small for you, Grog. But you could walk in it. Proportionally, it looks maybe like it was built for a little bit of a smaller person.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: I want to start eyeballing the ground of the house for any kinds of traps set out. Is that investigation, yeah?
Matt: That is investigation.
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18. Okay. So you guys begin to slowly--
Travis: Wait. Before we do, there are no random nudist giants that have run over in this area, right? There's nobody sees us over here taking off?
Taliesin: You're worried about giants streaking?
Travis: Not particularly.
Taliesin: That was very specific.
Travis: Well, yeah, have you ever seen a giant naked? You'll never forget it.
Taliesin: I might. I don't know.
Sam: Are you suggesting we set up a perimeter?
Travis: Yeah! I mean, it's a tiny house, I don't really want to go in there. I like having exits I fit through.
Laura: I don't want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way. But then, if they threaten us, I wouldn't want them to attack us, either.
Travis: Yeah, I'll just knock the house down from the outside.
Taliesin: Let's keep this structure standing for now.
Travis: I'll stay outside.
Sam: Are we knocking properly or are we just going to Invisibility in and see who's in there?
Laura: I feel like maybe knock properly.
Taliesin: If you think long and hard about it, it's not like manners have failed us very often.
Laura: Yeah. But do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up.
Marisha: I think we've failed at manners often.
Taliesin: We fail at manners more often. We'll see how this goes. We'll try being nice.
Travis: I'll stay out here.
Sam: I'll go knock on the door. It seems like a smallish door, right?
Laura: Yeah, I'll go with you.
Matt: Okay, so what's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go first.
Liam: Nothing perked up my spidey-sense?
Matt: From this current glance, no. You guys are behind a tree at a distance.
Travis: No nude giants, right?
Matt: Currently, no, but you're keeping an eye out.
Laura: I'm walking with a smile, looking very friendly.
Matt: Who's leading the charge?
Sam: I'll go knock.
Laura: I'll walk behind Scanlan.
Matt: We have Scanlan and Vex'ahlia.
Liam: I'm going to go, as well, and continue to eyeball for traps.
Taliesin: I'll be hanging back a bit, as well.
Marisha: I'll be comfortably back, as well.
Sam: Before we knock, what were we told was in this thing?
Travis: The key.
Sam: The key. Inside a person, inside a house.
Laura: It's possible the person is the key; we're not sure.
Matt: Is Trinket within your necklace for this?
Laura: No, he's out.
Matt: Okay, Trinket is out alongside you. Grog?
Laura: He's a very friendly bear, look at him!
Travis: I'm outside the house.
Laura: Trinket, smile! Be friendly!
Matt: As you get across this small walkway towards the front, as you're walking with a big smile, Vex'ahlia, something catches your eye on the ground right before her and you watch as she steps forward. You reach out and grab her wrist and hold her back before she steps down.
Laura: What is it?
Matt: There is a large, rusted, iron bear trap that is open that you almost stepped right into.
Travis: That would be have been donesies.
Laura: I was being friendly, and it almost crushed me. Trinket, be careful, this thing was made for you.
Matt: Trinket walks up to it.
Laura: No, no, be careful! Spit on it!
Matt: (growling)
Laura: Can he spit? Can Trinket spit?
Matt: (bear spitting) It's not very-- it's more of a power drool, if you will.
Liam: Is it easy enough to walk around?
Matt: You can walk around that one, and you begin to see what looks to be seven other ones that are clustered around.
Taliesin: This is probably a giant-infested forest.
Marisha: Yes, that's exactly why. Bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant.
Sam: Can we evade them and get into--
Matt: You begin to walk around. Yeah, you would, actually. As you step around one, you can see, at the front door, there is a welcome mat that says "welcome." As you're approaching it, you can see the welcome mat, there's just something a little off about it. Like, it's raised higher than the ground should be.
Travis: Willkommen.
Marisha: Trapped?
Liam: Well, I could attempt to dicker with it, but we could just knock the door over it if we really are going on manners.
Taliesin: Double-check to make sure the door isn't a problem, either. I'd imagine if the welcome mat is.
Liam: The door's going to blow up if we knock on it? I mean, we don't have much luck with doors.
Laura: Can I grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up?
Liam: Do you want to do that?
Matt: Are you stopping her from doing that?
Liam: Yes, I am! Let me take a look at it, please! I've already detected it. I will attempt to disarm it with thieves' tools, correct?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: That's fine. That is a 29.
Matt: You walk over. You look and you watch. There's a small cord that is hidden amongst the brush that runs from underneath the mat through a small ring that goes up from the house, then up a branch or vine, so it's hidden amongst them. You look straight up about 40 feet, you see a nice, solid, thick trunk that is just (creaking).
Travis: That's some Predator shit!
Matt: Right above the door.
Taliesin: I feel like there's a complicated story that goes along with all of this. I'm really excited by it.
Marisha: Is this going to be an Uncharted kind of adventure?
Taliesin: We have found the cabin of Macaulay Culkin!
Matt: So knowing this, you walk over and grab the cord. Looking to see where the leverage is, you motion to Grog to come over and hold it. You find another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall to the side. With Grog's help, you snip it, bring it over, and tie it onto the edge of this piece of the stonework, like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house. It holds the weight of this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step.
Liam: Percy, I'm sorry, I know you like a good Rube Goldberg.
Taliesin: I was really excited by this thing. It's a shame to dismantle it.
Laura: It's still there. Maybe when we leave, we can crash it down.
Liam: Does the door look hinky at all?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Marisha: You did say kinky, right?
Liam: I said hinky. 18.
Matt: 18. It does not appear to be trapped, per se. It does appear to be locked.
Liam: Yeah, well, I don't want to pick it.
Laura: I want to use a stick, and oh! Here, Scanlan, you were going to knock.
Sam: (chuckles) What is this stick?
Laura: So that you don't have to touch the door in case it's magic.
Matt: Which as a note, the door, at full height, is about at the shoulders of most of you. You recognize this. This is definitely a homestead built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome. It's still pretty big for a gnomish home, meaning it's a little more spacious headroom, you'd probably be able to stand in comfortably, except for you, Grog, you're probably a little hunched.
Liam: So it's like an ostentatious gnome door. Little more than is needed.
Sam: Like me. I'll just rap on the door with my knuckles.
Matt: Okay. There is an awkward pause.
Sam: Hello? Bidet?
Matt: Darin, if you want to go ahead onto the stage, please. (cheering)
Laura: I'm glad he didn't murder us with his bear traps.
Sam: You need this? Oh, you need this. Oh! I've been goosed.
Liam: Hey, chaotic evil necromancer gnome.
Matt: You weren't supposed to tell them.
Darin: I didn't.
Matt: So you hear amongst your business for the day, out of nowhere (knocking) on the door.
Sam: Kaitiaki!
Darin: I open it.
Matt: Okay, you hear (clicking) what sounds like six or seven different locks unlock on the door, as it slowly swings open, and before them what do they see?
Darin: A very small, elderly gnome, bald on top, with a long white beard, and a bit of a distant look in his eyes, and he looks at you and says, are you real?
Laura: I think so.
Darin: You're real? Prove it! Say that you're real to my invisible frog companion.
Sam: I will step forward and say, hello, there. (whispers) I'm real.
Darin: Yes, you're real. There is no invisible frog companion. The voices in my head would not have spoken to that. (stuttering) They know a little bit better than that, but that doesn't matter, I haven't had people here in over 35 years. (laughs) But you're here! And you're real! Go away. (laughter)
Darin: Demistrik, show them out.
Matt: You watch as two tiny red claws come around the corner as these tiny, impish wings unfurl. You watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the doorframe. (wings beating) "Get out!" (door slamming) and slams the door.
Darin: And show yourself out, Demistrik. I don't need you here, 19 years of you is more than enough.
Matt: You hear muffling argument through the door as the voice goes, "I'll stay where I damn please. You gave me permission to stay. If anyone is going to leave, you're going to leave!"
Darin: I think you should go to Kraghammer and become a circus performer with a little tin cup and a little hat and say, "Oh dear, I am Demistrik, the magical imp." That's where you belong, I tell you right now.
Matt: "Sounds like a lot more fun than having to deal with you on a daily basis, you son of a--"
Darin: (offended cry) Language, imp!
Matt: The door creaks open once more. "Sorry." (door closing)
Darin: The door creaks open again. I'm sorry, as well. (whispering) For him, he's awful.
Liam: I stick my foot in!
Darin: No! (laughter)
Liam: I'm really very sorry to bother you, although I'm delighted to make your acquaintance. I'm having a very hard time not just smiling like an idiot. Could we trouble you just for a few moments? We mean no harm at all. We do need to talk to you. We've come a very long way... as farts. That's got to count for something.
Laura: (sing-songy) We could give you some interesting conversation. 35 years is a very long time.
Liam: We've done a lot, we've seen a lot, we could tell you all about it.
Sam: I play an old, traditional gnome song to soften him a bit.
Matt: Make a performance check.
Laura: What is an old gnome song?
Sam: I don't know. (laughter)
Sam: 24.
Matt: It's been a long time since you've heard music, let alone one that scratches an old memory of childhood. It's nice.
Taliesin: It's more or less whatever strikes your fancy, to be fair.
All: (humming Going to the Chapel)
Matt: You see the imp in the back going, "Ugh! Stop that racket!"
Darin: You don't even appreciate music. What would an imp song sound like? You can't say one, can you? Because you don't have music where you're from.
Matt: "I can, but it'll cause your ears to bleed! It sounds like this." (screeching)
Darin: I find that very entertaining.
Matt: "You're such a liar!" The imp (poof) vanishes before you.
Darin: He's gone. Don't worry about him. He gets a little bit... testy, if you will.
Sam: May we speak? May we have a moment of your time?
Darin: Oh, well... Very well. You can come in if you like. Oh! Be careful, there's illusions and thingamabobbers.
Liam: (stammers) Sorry, that's infectious. We have a really big guy. Are you all right with him coming in? Grog, are you all right with coming in?
Travis: How the fuck do I get in that damn door?
Liam: Have you not crawled on all fours before?
Taliesin: You should try it if you haven't; it's quite delightful.
Travis: Are you lying?
Taliesin: No. For once, no, I'm not.
Travis: Can I do an insight check on Percy?
Matt: Sure.
Travis: 19.
Taliesin: I have never actually been quite so honest in my entire life. I think you'll find it very therapeutic.
Travis: I roll in on all fours.
Taliesin: How does it feel?
Travis: I'm waiting for it to kick in.
Taliesin: Crawl forward, back a bit, stretch, downward dog, stretch.
Matt: You watch as this large, gray-skinned mountain of a man crawls his way in. You could duck-walk through if you really wanted to. This is worse than Gandalf in Bag End. All fours is probably the most comfortable means of transport through the house. But you walk in and immediately, you watch as your new gnomish friend is going around and quickly disabling small things, putting small keys and tying off strings and wires you saw that were set up around portions of the room.
Taliesin: I am going to try and map this in my head, the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.
Matt: This place is a hoarder's den. You see shelves and shelves of books and papers and scrolls and stacks of them. You see on bits of furniture and chairs more stacks of books and sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells. Some spilled and left and dried long ago. This place is very lived-in, very chaotic, and very unique.
Liam: The first thing that I do as we come in is I scan the room, or rooms, for more Macaulay Culkin shenanigans.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Maculkins. I think we can just call them Maculkins now.
Liam: That is a 21.
Matt: Okay. You do see there's one portion of the floor that he keeps avoiding, instinctually, that catches your attention. You're like, "why does he keep walking around that?"
Marisha: What's your name, friend?
Darin: Oh, well, that was taken from me a very long time ago. I only have what they call me. You know, names are an odd thing, aren't they? Sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not be your property, and then who you were is not who you are and yet... here we are.
Marisha: That oddly made way too much sense.
Sam: What do they call you?
Darin: They call me Sprigg. There's more. They call me Sprigg the Obnoxious.
Sam: Sprigg the Obnoxious?
Darin: Yes. It's not my given name; it was a name that was given to me when it was given to me.
Liam: Did you used to be obnoxious? Because I'm not picking that up.
Darin: Oh. We're rarely who we used to be.
Taliesin: Is there mercury in those pools? (laughter)
Darin: Who? Is that a friend of yours?
Taliesin: I sometimes will talk to the fourth wall. It's a thing; ignore it.
Darin: It's a domicile. There has to be four walls. If there weren't, it would be a yurt. I don't live in a yurt, dear boy.
Marisha: I sometimes live in a yurt. They're quite nice.
Darin: I have nothing against yurts. (laughs) Like a stick that you would put in a yurt so it wouldn't fall over. I would want it to fall over, therefore, I have nothing against yurts. (wheezing laughter) Demistrik!
Matt: The imp just appears across the room and just goes, "Good one. That was-- I am so sorry."
Laura: Pike? Do you think maybe a Greater Restoration is in order?
Matt: Pike goes, "Why?"
Laura: No reason.
Matt: "Could I just touch your hand for a second? Is that okay?"
Darin: (stuttering) Why?
Matt: "Just to see if we can help your day."
Darin: Do you not think that I'm real?
Matt: "Probably not."
Darin: I assure you, I'm real. I'm here. My companions are long gone. They were like you, like you, like you, and you, and you, and I'm all that is left. You are looking into a mirror of your future.
Sam: I'm going to look like you, or you're going to look like me?
Marisha: No, I know what he means. Who were your companions?
Darin: Memories. They're all memories now. I don't even remember their names. I remember some of them, but we were heroes and now I am here.
Marisha: Oh no.
Liam: Were there no other gnome folk in your party?
Darin: No, there was one like you, there was a big one, a mighty one. There was one like you, brave and kind.
Laura: That's like me! That's exactly like me.
Darin: There was one like you. Smart, yet sad. And you, as well. Yeah, and I was you.
Matt: Pike goes, "Please?" She grabs your hand and concentrates for a second, you watch as the holy symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes through her arms into your hand. And it feels nice. It's like holding a freshly heated cup of tea. And as the spell completes and she pulls back. "That's all. Thank you."
Darin: Thank you, very kind of you. Don't ever do that again.
Matt: "Right, okay. Okay."
Sam: Your companions. Not to bring up sad times. How long ago did they go away? Perish?
Darin: 37 years.
Sam: And how, was it in a fight?
Darin: Oh, yes.
Sam: Against a powerful entity?
Darin: Oh no. Against ignorance, against bravery that should never have been. And that's why I'm here and they're not, because I ran, you see. I'm your future. You'll all be gone. You and you and you and you and you, and you'll be left.
Liam: While listening to all that, Vax slid his hand into Keyleth's and quietly listened to the whole thing.
Darin: Oh, well. Perhaps we should talk of other things. Should we?
Sam: Yes. Yes, we want this to be a positive visit for you, so is there anything we can tell you from the world outside that you might be curious about?
Darin: The world outside? Who needs the world outside? I have everything here, and what I need, dear boy, I have taken from Kraghammer. All these books over there, you see, those are mine. They should have been mine to begin with, and I took them, and now they are mine. (wheezing laughter)
Taliesin: I'm going to peruse some of these titles, quietly.
Sam: The books, you mean?
Darin: Yes. You'd like to look at the books, would you?
Taliesin: I find it's the easiest way to learn quite a bit about a person.
Darin: Oh, you're very welcome to look at anything you like. What will you give me, dear boy? I require something. And yet, what do I need, living here? Not much. Intelligence, no. Secrets, no. Love, no. Sadness, bravery, power. What do you have that you would give me?
Travis: I reach in the Bag of Holding. I take out Percy's glasses. Would you care for a pair of these testicl-- spectacles?
Darin: I seek power, dear boy, not silliness. If I wanted silliness, I would talk to a Sun Tree. No one ever should talk to a Sun Tree, they should only listen to a Sun Tree. And so I shall say again, if you would like to peruse my book and perhaps find what you are looking for, what will you give me that would bring power and redemption into my life?
Sam: What do you have, Grog?
Laura: (whispering) Give him some ale.
Travis: But that's not fucking power.
Laura: You don't know. Bet it's been a while since he's had some of that.
Darin: It seems you have powerful items.
Travis: I do. I have these Bracers of Defense.
Darin: Ah, but that is strength. I require power.
Travis: (softly) Shit. Fuck.
Taliesin: Well, I reach into my bag and start cleaning a small green shard of residuum, polishing it.
Darin: Demistrik! If you excuse me for a just-- while you look, I'll just talk to my imp. You'll pardon us. (whispering) A word, Demistrik?
Matt: "Ugh. Just one moment. What?"
Darin: The big one worries me. I think we should have a code in case we have to jump him.
Matt: "What code would you wish?"
Darin: Goliath grab! But we need to remember that. We need to remember that.
Matt: "Goliath grab. Good luck!"
Darin: We need some sort of mnemonic device to remember goliath grab. G, goodness gracious, grab that goliath. O?
Matt: "O? Huh. I'll tell you what, I've got your back."
Darin: I don't feel that at all. You're right in front of me. How could you have my back? (wheezing chuckle) I got you. (laughing) Go away. So what do you have for me? You've had ample time to look in your Bag of Holding to produce something very--
Travis: Powerful. Well, I do have one thing that seems to be pretty powerful.
Marisha: Oh no, Grog.
Travis: I pull out of the Bag of Holding a small leather case. I open the flap. I don't know if you have any interest in this, but my experience with these items has been very extreme. Would you care to take a card?
Darin: Would you care to give them to me?
Sam: All or just one?
Travis: No, you can pick a card.
Matt: Make an arcana check. Roll a d20 and add your arcana skill modifier to it.
Taliesin: You are a madman.
Darin: 15.
Matt: 15. You don't recognize what he's holding in his hands, but you immediately see the leather casing around it, and your essence being able to read certain elements of magic-- It does appear to be a powerful enchantment, whatever he has procured from the bag.
Darin: Indeed. Perhaps one card for one book?
Travis: Yeah, sure. I mean, Percy, do you have a book out of all of these that you want to read?
Darin: What are you looking for? What do you seek? What knowledge? I've got it all here.
Sam: We seek a key.
Laura: To find a very ancient goddess--
Darin: Oh, don't say Ioun.
Taliesin: We're not going to say Ioun.
Darin: You just did!
Liam: Is there another name that you would like us to use? Like a nickname instead of Ioun?
Darin: The Broken Goddess. I know more than Ioun, please! Ioun. Gods, what do they know? We know more than they, for we exist! We live! We adventure! They merely observe. Am I right?
Sam: You have a point. They don't do much for us in the day-to-day.
Taliesin: Are you saying you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Of course I know more than Ioun.
Taliesin: Can you prove that you know more than Ioun?
Darin: Yes.
Taliesin: So if I ask you a question that is almost impossible to answer, you could answer it before Ioun could answer it?
Darin: Could Ioun create a rock so heavy that even she couldn't lift it?
Taliesin: Oh, please. I'm far too clever to ask such a simple question. That's easy. I would have to ask something that was very difficult to answer.
Darin: I will give you your answer if you give me a card.
Liam: You know, I was just saying what a good idea I thought it was, but I thought you were talking about the entire deck, Grog. I think the entire deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a card, because that seems unpredictable to me.
Travis: Yeah, that sounds perfect to me.
Liam: We're all in a small, enclosed space together, Grog, and I like this fellow.
Laura: Sprigg, it is quite powerful, yes, but also maybe slightly dangerous.
Taliesin: A bit dangerous, to be fair.
Darin: I'm here alone. Well, there's... oh, yes. Go peddle your papers somewhere where they'd like papers peddled!
Laura: You're not alone at the moment.
Darin: That's true!
Laura: This is very true. And I'd rather not put my life in the hands of you, not knowing you very well.
Darin: Some did. I'm here.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: They are not.
Laura: So something bad could happen, and you'd run away, and we'd be stuck here?
Darin: No. 37 years. I ran away. I've been here deciding how to live again, how not to run away. That's what all this is about, isn't it? You can't just hide from the world. I've done it! Done it for a long, long time. Maybe you being here means that I should hide no longer. Or maybe I just have an invisible frog friend. Maybe I have nothing here, and nothing here.
Taliesin: Whoever has devised these contraptions and created this safety for you is a genius. I'm not saying you're necessarily--
Darin: It was both of us.
Taliesin: I somehow don't think so.
Darin: What?
Matt: "It was all me."
Taliesin: I've had my own demons to contend with in my life, to make me doubt my own intelligence. I get the sense that your compatriot-- I hate to call it friend, here--
Darin: I hate to call it friend, and yet I do. Isn't that right, friend?
Matt: "Unfortunately."
Taliesin: What are you doing here?
Darin: You can tell them.
Matt: "No!"
Darin: Just tell him.
Matt: "No! Why, because he asked me?"
Darin: Yes! Be polite. They're guests in our home.
Matt: "Oh, it's not our home."
Darin: 19 years you've been here, ever since your master died trying to enter and got tricked into one of my traps, and now you're here-- does that answer your question?-- now, why don't you tell him what I just said?
Matt: "My master died trying to get in here on one of the traps, and now I call this my home."
Darin: Beautifully said. Bravo. You should be a little performer in Kraghammer. You know what the reviews would be? Not very good! Shameful behavior. Abysmal behavior from the Abyss itself!
Taliesin: We don't have much. Many of the things that we carry are very dangerous. Obviously, you have a great deal of genius here. I'm going to show him the elemental shard. I don't know if this would interest you, but I consider it to be of great value.
Matt: So you're showing him the residuum piece?
Taliesin: The last piece of residuum I have.
Matt: All right. So this is a sliver of what looks like green glass. It's finely polished, about that thick, that long. You've read about this. You've read that condensed residuum is very susceptible to enchantment and/or the focusing of short-term magic spells. It's expensive, it's lauded, it's hard to find.
Darin: I will use that Ring of Telekinesis to lift it up and take a better look at it.
Matt: You watch as it darts out of your hand and wisps up, maybe two feet ahead of him, and slowly rotates above him as he inspects it.
Taliesin: Impressive, but not as impressive as the giant log.
Darin: Oh, yes. But is there power in this, dear boy? Or are there only secrets? For you are secrets. He is power.
Taliesin: I may be secrets, and that is of me, but I believe there is power in its secret. People died for that. Many people.
Darin: People die every day. Except me. That's my punishment, child. I live on. I live on with my shame and my intelligence and you.
Laura: Because of Ioun?
Marisha: What's your relationship to her?
Darin: What is anyone's relationship to a god?
Marisha: Good question.
Laura: Some of us are champions. Some of them don't like them. Some of them worship them but don't really get respect. What's yours?
Darin: All of that and more.
Laura: So you're a champion? Are you a champion of Ioun?
Marisha: You're a champion of Ioun. Of course he's a champion of Ioun.
Darin: I wouldn't say that.
Taliesin: But we might, wouldn't we?
Darin: Champion of Ioun?
Matt: (demonic cackling)
Darin: Are you going to start calling me Ioun's Champion?
Matt: "Only if it bothers you, Ioun's Champion!"
Darin: I like it. Drat, eh? Drat. You tell them what you know of Ioun.
Matt: "She's a heinous bitch who got what's coming to her 800 years ago."
Marisha: What?
Darin: It's a bit common, but that is his belief. What is yours? What is your thought about Ioun?
Sam: We know that she possesses knowledge that could help us in our quest to save the world, and therefore, no matter what her personality is, she is valuable to us.
Darin: And yet, is there value in saving the world? Or should you just let it all go away?
Laura: No, no, I think we should save it.
Sam: Yeah, we're pro-world here.
Darin: Are you? That is interesting.
Liam: Sprigg, you're seeking power.
Darin: I seek redemption. There is great power in redemption.
Liam: We offer you redemption. Collaborating with us grants you the power to fell a would-be god.
Darin: Excuse me. For one second. Can I speak to you for just a second?
Matt: (flapping wings) "What?"
Darin: He's tricky. I think we should get a mnemonic device on what we need to do if he becomes too tricky. We should say, elf boy grab! E! For egads! There's an elf, we should grab him. L! Let's grab that elf boy.
Matt: "Right, all right." You guys can hear all of this.
Darin: F. Forsooth, I shall grab this elf boy!
Liam: I'm not an elf. Not an elf.
Marisha: Why do people like calling you elf boy and elf girl?
Liam: We have vaguely pointed ears. Not even fully pointed ears. My mother was not an elf.
Darin: Just a second. He's not an elf!
Matt: "We'll stick with the device. I've got your back."
Darin: I still don't feel it.
Matt: "You will."
Darin: All right. Hello!
Sam: Hi. Hi, mirror man. Listen.
Darin: All right.
Sam: Let's cut to the chase here. We need information from you.
Darin: Indeed.
Sam: You need something from us. Grog, give him a card.
Marisha: Wait.
Sam: We're dancing around this! We need this man!
Laura: He took the stone! Are you taking the stone?
Sam: Are you going to take the stone as a source of power? He said it's too mysterious.
Liam: I thought we were talking about redemption.
Darin: If you'll allow me. You've been very quiet.
Marisha: Yes, I'm a little freaked out right now. You're my worst fear incarnate. Sorry, that seemed very rude. My worst nightmare incarnate.
Darin: That didn't make it any better, dear child!
Matt: (cackling)
Darin: (shushing) Go ahead. Why am I your worst fear in a carnation?
Marisha: I've seen you in my dreams.
Darin: Hear that?
Matt: "Go get her, tiger."
Laura: Trinket starts chasing the imp around the room.
Matt: "No!" Up into the corner, (hissing). Turns invisible.
Darin: Oh, I guess you found that unbearable!
Sam: That was a good pun.
Matt: You hear the tiniest little demonic fart by your ear.
Liam: I'm also gently steering Trinket away from the floorboard in the middle of the room as he walked by.
Marisha: Somehow everything you have said since the minute we've walked into this building has made 100% sense, and I think that's what scares me the most, is I understand everything you've said.
Darin: It should scare you the most. I was one of you. I did what you did. 37 years ago, I did it. And we fought, and we fought, and they were right here. They were right here!
Sam: Who is they?
Darin: My companions.
Sam: And who were you fighting against? You, we?
Travis: Vecna.
Darin: No.
Sam: Gods?
Darin: It was silly. It was hobgoblins. It should never have happened. It was a simple fight, and they died, and I ran, and I can't even remember their names.
Liam: Sprigg.
Darin: Yes?
Liam: Would you like to be needed again? Maybe it's time to stop running.
Darin: What would I do?
Marisha: We can grant you power in items, but I don't want to speak for all of us, but I think all of us can speak a little bit to the fact that items don't grant you as much inner power as you expect them to.
Laura: Unless they're boots. And then they're amazing.
Marisha: Unless they're very highly argued and debated-upon boots, in which case I still think the argument--
Darin: Are we about to have a debate about boots? I'm against them! Your turn.
Laura: I am for them, usually.
Darin: Continue, Councilor, but watch yourself.
Laura: Have you any idea where the key to Ioun is?
Darin: In the boots? We're talking about boots, are we?
Laura: Yes. Boots that hold a key to Ioun's location. Specifically.
Darin: I think the key might be here, but I don't really know.
Liam: Sprigg, the world is on the brink right now. It's worse than hobgoblins. We've come here in great need, and the world is in great need, and the power that I offer you is making a difference.
Darin: Then make me believe in Ioun. We'll make a difference together.
Liam: Make you believe?
Marisha: Of course he believes. Believing is not the question.
Darin: Books everywhere, you see. That's something you can hold. That's something you can learn.
Marisha: That's something that's tangible. Ioun is distant.
Laura: But she could be tangible if you'd help us find her.
Marisha: What if we have found her? What if Sprigg is right? What if all of the information that Ioun knows is here in Sprigg?
Taliesin: I really want to look at these. I want to look at these books really quickly. I'm having a moment. I just want to start looking at these titles. What are these books?
Matt: You go over and start walking towards the edge of the nearest bookcase, and all of you at once-- everyone but Sprigg, actually-- suddenly hear a voice come through, filling your mind, filling your consciousness, filling your ears. Sourceless, delivered to your consciousness directly. "Thank you for showing me where he is." And that's where we're going to take a break.
Liam: Fuck!
Marisha: How? We don't have the eye! What a cock!
Taliesin: Oh my god, he's been in the troll dick all along.
Marisha: It's always been the troll dick.
Matt: All right, we'll be in just a minute. We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. For the Twitch giveaway, we have this awesome Peruvian walnut dice tray, leather interior. It's very nice. It's the same type that I have, actually, back here, which is nice. Giving it away for somebody in the Twitch chat, so run on over, and the code for the evening is Sprigg. S-P-R-I...
Darin: G-G.
Matt: G-G. Double G.
Darin: S-P-R-I-G-G spells Sprigg, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to win that valuable prize.
Matt: So pay attention in the chat. When it's time to, go ahead and enter Sprigg into the chat, and one lucky winner will be announced when we get back here. See you guys in a few minutes! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so first and foremost, we have our winner for the dice tray from Wyrmwood. That is our friend k0sn1ght, spelled in the way that you spell your XBox Live name: k0sn1ght. Congratulations, you are the winner. Go ahead and contact Danoba and get your information and we'll get that shipped out to you. Bringing us back in.
Taliesin: That was fast.
Matt: Last we left off, you all, almost all of you, heard a singular familiar voice. The low, gravelly undead voice of The Whispered One fills your minds, saying, "Thank you for showing me where he is." In that moment where you all pause in place, you hear a series of simultaneous sounds (arrows firing) as a number of heavy crossbow bolts from nearby windows all fire simultaneously at Sprigg.
Marisha: Do I have time for a reaction?
Matt: No, you do not. This is a surprise round.
Liam: This is the sound of bolts, no.
Travis: It's all right, he can't die. It's cool. We're all right.
Matt: So that first one is a 24. What's your armor class?
Darin: My armor class is 19.
Matt: Okay! So you take 23 points of piercing damage.
Darin: Okay. Oh, there we go.
Matt: That's 17. That misses you. It strikes your shoulder and glances off. One bolt sinks into your chest and you look down and you see it's this big, long heavy metal bolt and it's jutting out from the side of where your shoulder and pec is. Another one rushes by and glances off your other shoulder. The third one--
Darin: Well, this is different.
Matt: That hits. That's a 25. That's 23 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Matt: That one actually misses; a six and a one. It slams into one of the nearby books right behind you, barely moving past your cheek. Fifth one, that is a 19 exactly, so you take 24 points of damage.
Laura: How many fucking bolts are there?
Marisha: 24?
Matt: They're all sneak attack. And that is 20.
Darin: Another one?
Matt: Another one.
Darin: Okay.
Matt: That one's going to be 26 points of piercing damage.
Darin: I'm gone.
Matt: You guys watch as all these bolts (arrows firing and impacting) into Sprigg's body and Sprigg falls back, unconscious on the side of the room. I'm going to bring out a map now.
Darin: Fly, you fools!
Marisha: (yelling) No, Sprigg!
Sam: Darin, it was really great having you on. Thanks so much.
Laura: Whoa, cool!
Sam: Whoa, this is a cute house!
Laura: Oh, I can't see inside of it.
Matt: Moving the top floor off.
Liam: There's crates of apples!
Sam: There's a sack of something in the corner! Oh my god, how are we all going to fit in there?
Matt: Sprigg is currently unconscious on the ground there. Percival was there talking. Trinket is off to the side.
Laura: Trinket! Where's the imp?
Matt: The imp is not currently visible. Pike would be over on the side here. Keyleth, Vax, where would you guys see yourselves right now? Actually, tell me where you would be. I think that's what I'm trying to ask.
Liam: I would be right next to Keyleth because I was holding her hand.
Matt: As I chuck you onto the ground.
Liam: It's all right. It's fine.
Matt: Yeah, comes back in a day later. All right, cool. So you're there holding that. Scanlan, where would you be?
Sam: Near Sprigg-ish.
Matt: All right, so I'll put you right there next to the scroll in the ground.
Liam: And Matt? Could you touch on the map where the bad man touched you? No, where the bad floorboard is?
Matt: Yes, actually, I can do that.
Liam: None of you know this.
Matt: None of you know this, except for you, which is actually why I'm not going to show you. You know how to avoid it, but nobody else knows where it is.
Laura: Where is the front door?
Matt: The front door is right there.
Liam: There, over by Grog on your right.
Sam: These trees need to move.
Laura: I know, these trees are a pain in our butts. Oh no.
Sam: There's cloaked men everywhere
Matt: You watch as one that was up in the stairs vanishes up top.
Travis: Oh, he actually made it upstairs?
Matt: He fired, and then ducked up there. I need everyone to roll initiative.
Sam: Initiative?
Matt: Yes. Including you, even though you're on the ground.
Marisha: Don't. Fuck. Me. Gil. It's fine. Gil did all right.
Sam: I don't trust Gil. I never roll on his dice.
Liam: Rarely. I have, but I got my Matt Colville meteorite.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: 20.
Travis: 22.
Matt: Oh wow, so we have Percy, we have Grog, and Vax. Okay, 20 to 15?
Sam: 19.
Laura: Should somebody roll for Pike?
Matt: Yes, actually. Okay, yeah.
Darin: Also a 19.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: You've got a very low initiative bonus.
Matt: All righty, anybody else?
Laura: 13.
Marisha: 12. I don't know why I did deuces. 12.
Taliesin: Peace out.
Sam: NKOTB.
Marisha: 12 initiative, Wu Tang out.
Taliesin: That's our next shirt.
Sam: Quidd, everyone. Quidd.
Laura: Quidd.
Liam: Quid pro quo.
Matt: All right, so top of the combat round. The surprise round is done, you watch Sprigg fall to the ground, bolts sticking out of the side of the neck, the shoulder, and the body. Unconscious, now beginning to pool blood underneath where he's bleeding out, and you glance around and you see a series of shaded figures in the windows that all dart out of the way.
Marisha: Cowards.
Laura: Dicks.
Sam: Oh, they left. The fight's over, everyone.
Matt: Percy, you're up first.
Taliesin: Wow, this is a lot that happened. I'm going to click my boots, and I'm going to run up the wall and run upstairs.
Matt: Which, for the purposes of this, I will place the upstairs over here. So as you dart up, Percival, you run up the stairway there where the one guy you saw was standing.
Taliesin: Is he right there?
Matt: Yeah, he ducked out of the way, and there's also one figure that you recognize from the Shadowfell earlier. You see one of the ghastly creatures that was darting through the ruins leaping from from rooftop to rooftop. Its skin is grayish and long, its limbs lanky, its fingers curled into claws, and this long tongue dangling from his jaws, it's getting ready to run down the stairs as you charge him, and it goes (growls).
Taliesin: Manners! Action Surge!
Marisha: Yay, Manners!
Matt: Okay then.
Marisha: We're bad at manners, until now!
Matt: All righty, so what's the saving throw on that one?
Taliesin: It's a DC 20 strength. Oh, I'm sorry, no. Never mind. It's an attack roll.
Matt: Okay, so you have to roll first to see if you hit it.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: 18? Yeah, that definitely hits. It hits, and you watch as you pull the sphere out and chuck it in the direction of the creature. Pulls its claws back, slams into its chest, and then unravels. It falls to the ground, prone, unable to move, right there in the middle of the floor.
Taliesin: Just making sure that I can do this.
Matt: Was that your action, there, doing that?
Taliesin: That was my action surge. I can only do one round. Just seeing if I have anything at a bonus that I can do.
Matt: You spent your action--?
Taliesin: My action, I activated my boots. My action surge activating that. Do I have anything I can do with a bonus action?
Matt: Not really.
Taliesin: I'm going to turn to the other guy and pull the ripcord on the glove angrily. (revving)
Matt: You load up Diplomacy. Good. That's your turn, Percy. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Me? Oh? Can I go into a rage?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Travis: And he fell where?
Matt: He fell right there, on the ground, currently bleeding out.
Travis: Can I run over to Sprigg and shove a-- should I shove a health potion in his throat?
Laura: Well, we've got healers.
Travis: Right. I'll run upstairs to see where Percy went.
Matt: You rage-run just past Percival and you see there's one creature bound on the ground and there's another guy who's there with his crossbow, he's trying to reload, who sees Percival and is getting ready to pull it up as you leap in front.
Taliesin: Smash him!
Travis: Do you mind?
Taliesin: Please!
Travis: Yeah. (rage noises)
Matt: Go for it. Roll for a double attack.
Travis: Reckless! Not Great Weapon Master. Two-handed with the Dwarven Thrower. That's a lot. 30, minus-- oh, there is no minus. 32.
Matt: 32 hits. Second attack?
Travis: 31.
Matt: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage for both.
Travis: So they're not giants. So I just roll a d10. That's a ten. Rage damage. 25.
Matt: 25 damage on the first hit?
Travis: On the first one. Second one.
Laura: 24.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Nice. With your hammer, two hands, whack right across the side of its head. You see the jaw unhinge from the side. As he pulls back, it's hanging loosely there, and the second hit you clock right in the side of the temple, and it nearly goes unconscious, and picks itself up again, gets its crossbow ready. It's still holding. It's not down yet, but it's hurt badly. You can see now, up close, you can see these figures, they're dressed in very, very tight black leathers, cloaks enshrouding their body, the hood is still up, but you've knocked it back. There you see a human male in his late 40s, early 50s, the head shaved completely bald, a tattoo of black tendrils around the left eye, and the left eye is missing from the socket.
Travis: Black tendrils? Okay, cool. That's my turn.
Matt: That's your turn. All right. Grog's done. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, let's talk this out. Click the Boots of Haste. I think, with 120 feet of movement, I can blur up the stairs to where Percy is in probably 50 or 60 feet. And then finish that movement and go past the guy, out the window, with all of my movement in 120 feet or less. Okay, so I'm doing that.
Matt: There's also a window here, a window here, and a window here. Just so you guys know, and a window here, if you wanted.
Liam: Definitely understand. Blur up the stairs, shoot past Percy, shoot past that guy, out the window.
Matt: You're on the balcony now, looking right about here.
Liam: Do I already see those guys?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot.
Matt: 19 plus 14? Yeah, you do see them. And you glance down, you can see they're hiding amongst bushes, and they're specifically stealthed. But you're keen of eye enough to see where they're placed.
Liam: I stealth, hide. Bonus action to hide. I'm going to use Luck. That's better. 27.
Matt: 27. Okay. You're not sure if they see you or not.
Liam: All right, then from this spot, if they're in range, I'm going to throw Whisper at one of them.
Matt: Right now, you are currently up here. So you glance off and you can barely see one that's over the edge of the roof right there. That's the only one you can see.
Liam: But I can see them and I can ignore three-quarters cover because of Sharpshooter.
Matt: So you barely see the edge of one there. Sharpshooter. I'd say yeah, you can. You can hit both, if you want.
Liam: So the one that I can see, hidden, I will try to throw Whisper. I'm going to hopefully sneak attack him and bamf there. That is a 28.
Matt: 28. He does not see you. So you have advantage on that if you want to roll again.
Liam: Right. Natural 20.
Taliesin: Turn him into paste.
Liam: Okay. (counting)
Sam: Did Pike roll?
Matt: Pike did.
Laura: What did she get?
Matt: 11. Typical Pike.
Marisha: She's after me.
Laura: Well, no, but Sprigg is right after Scanlan. He's before we are. So I'd rather get him up before.
Liam: So that one is 60 on that guy.
Matt: 60 points of damage?
Liam: Yes, and I bamf there.
Matt: As you chuck the dagger, like right towards where the center of the shoulderblades connect in the back he (groans) and you watch as the crossbow that he had drops to the ground and he crumples over on top of it, but he slowly starts getting to his feet out of the bushes. He looks really hurt, but he's still standing. And you appear right next to him there.
Liam: So I did movement, I hid for my bonus, I have action-action as a paladin. And action.
Matt: You have attack-attack as a paladin.
Liam: Attack-attack as a paladin. And then my bonus action. That was the first of attack-attack, so now I'll just do a regular attack, which is a 20--
Laura: (sarcastically) I'm so glad he got those boots back, I'm just so glad.
Liam: 30.
Matt: 30 hits.
Liam: That is a ten and I'm going to pump him full of poison. He has to make a DC check on 15.
Matt: That is a seven. No. Four plus three.
Liam: So he also gets, that was ten plus 14 total. 20 total, between the dagger and the poison.
Matt: So the second dagger, you shiv him in the side and he (groans) goes to spin with the heavy crossbow and try and pull away, and as soon as the poison through him he goes, (gurgles) and you can see blood vomit down the front of his chest, his eyes roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground.
Liam: And there's another guy there who can see me, right?
Matt: Yeah, and he's hidden, but he's like (scared, heavy breathing).
Liam: Whisper.
Matt: Okay, he's trying to see that you're not being seen.
Liam: That is 31. Yeah, okay. So that is two plus eight is ten, plus psychic damage. 18. I'm going to bamf there with Whisper.
Matt: Okay. All righty. You hit him and you stand there. You're right in front of him now. All righty. That ends your go. As you appear over on the other side, you realize that over in the clearing there, there is another one of the robed figures, this one clutching a long, black, smooth staff that crooks over in the front that looks like a hand holding an eye.
Marisha: What? Where? Who? There were more of them!
Liam: But you guys don't know that yet.
Matt: You guys don't know that yet, just him. Ending your turn, Vax. That guy on the ground is going to try and break free. That is a 17. DC 20?
Taliesin: DC 20.
Matt: It struggles on the ground and can't seem to break free of the current magic manacles that hold it in place.
Taliesin: Yeah, he's stuck. I love that we have floors!
Matt: Another one of these darts through the window, leaps across the way, right in front of Sprigg, and you being right there, Scanlan, goes, (angry hissing) and lashes out at you.
Marisha: He's going for Sprigg!
Taliesin: He's going for Scanlan.
Marisha: But because Scanlan's over Sprigg!
Taliesin: Oh, that's fair.
Matt: Makes two claw strikes at you. First one is 16 to hit.
Sam: Yes.
Matt: All right. You suffer eight points of slashing damage, and I need you make a constitution saving throw.
Sam: Oh boy. Not great. 16.
Matt: 16, okay.
Sam: Is it magical?
Matt: No, it is not magical, but you feel this pulse of some sort of necrotic disease hit your system, and you just manage to shrug it off. (relieved cheering)
Matt: The other claw comes towards you. That's a natural 20.
Sam: Natural 20 to hit, sure.
Matt: That is 30 points of slashing damage on the second hit. Make another saving throw, please.
Sam: That's 17.
Matt: 17. The second strike hits you and you feel as the side of your torso gets torn out of the side, the blood splatters onto Sprigg, who's already bloodied and now there's gnome blood on gnome blood. As you reach for your side, however, it does not take effect; you manage to shrug off.
Travis: Those are constitution saving throws?
Matt: Yeah. That ends the shadow ghast's turn. Sprigg, I need you to make a death saving throw, please. Roll a d20.
Liam: Come on, Sprigg!
Marisha: Come on, Sprigg!
Darin: 14.
Matt: Okay, so you're okay for now. You're stabilizing. You're not bleeding out, yet. Mark a success on your death saving throws there. Scanlan, what are you doing?
Sam: I am going to, bonus action-- down here, success, one.
Matt: Actually, before he even does that, what are you doing on your turn?
Sam: I'm going to heal him first.
Matt: That roll wouldn't matter because he may heal you before you come up. Don't worry about it.
Sam: I'll bonus action Healing Word him, 2nd-level. I will sing to him. I'll do a little line dance right in front of him and I'll say: (singing) I'll heal your heart, your achy breaky heart. I just don't think you'll understand. That if I heal your heart, your achy breaky heart, you got to wake up and kill a man!
All: Ooh!
Darin: (singing) If only you had used Mage Hand!
Sam: Nice!
Matt: So how much does he heal?
Sam: Seven plus six. 13.
Matt: You heal 13 hit points. That roll doesn't matter. You hear this echoing song in the back of your head. The second song today you've heard from your childhood. You come to consciousness. You wake up and look around you and you can see him singing to you as this giant horrible necrotic creature is looming right in front of you. You have metal bolts sticking out of your chest and an old sensation you haven't felt in a long time courses through your body, which is the need to survive.
Sam: It's my turn still.
Matt: It's both of your turns at the same time.
Sam: I will hold my turn.
Matt: What are you going to do?
Sam: Dimension Door, but I'm holding until either Pike or Keyleth heals him more. And I will also say to him, old man, do you have some fight left in you?
Darin: I hope so.
Sam: Hold that thought for one second.
Darin: Holding.
Matt: So what are you doing?
Darin: There's a bookcase, is there not?
Matt: There's bookcases here, bookcase there. There's books strewn and clustered in these corners.
Darin: I'd like to, if I could, use the Ring of Telekinesis to pull a bookcase down upon an attacker.
Matt: Okay. Currently there's a bunch of books up here on a shelf, you can pull them down on him if you'd like.
Darin: I would like to do that.
Matt: So from the ground, you yank a bunch of heavy tomes off of this large shelf that goes flying towards this creature. I'm going to make this a dexterity saving throw for it.
Marisha: The pen is mightier than the bookcase security!
Matt: What's the DC on the telekinesis ring?
Darin: Where was it? Ring of Telekinesis.
Matt: I'll pull it up here real fast. Looking up magical items really fast. I have it here. Oh, it's for the spell Telekinesis? That's right. What's your spell DC?
Darin: 17.
Matt: 17. No, that's a failure. So for this, go ahead and roll 3d6.
Sam: He failed, or the guy failed?
Matt: The guy failed. He didn't dodge out of the way. He's like, (confused snarling, book impacts) and gets pummeled from behind by a bunch of tomes, books, and random glass baubles that were on the shelf that shatter against the back of its head.
Darin: We have a six, we have a five, and we have a two. 13.
Matt: Then add your intelligence modifier.
Darin: My intelligence modifier is a four.
Matt: 17, nice! 17 points of damage to that one. As you slam it in the back of the head (impacts) and it doubles over and (snarling), its long tongue slashing around. You're still on the ground, and it's over you. Is there anything else you want to do on your turn?
Darin: Demistrik?!
Matt: You hear nothing.
Taliesin: Not cool.
Darin: Can I cast something?
Matt: That is an action to do that, so if you have a bonus action spell, you could do that.
Darin: I believe I do. Tasha's Hideous Laughter?
Matt: I believe that's an action to cast, unfortunately.
Darin: I don't think we have any bonus actions. Oh, are there any healing potions that I can use my Telekinesis to get a healing potion to me?
Matt: You can do that next round. The attack was your one action. You can stand on your feet, if you'd like to.
Darin: No, I'm gonna stay right here.
Matt: Got it. That ends your turn. Now, these guys go again.
Laura: That's good, they're at disadvantage, now, to hit you. They are! Because you're prone.
Matt: This guy's going to move in. This guy is still standing and is going to drop the crossbow and pull out his shortsword. Is going to go ahead and attack you, Grog, first. That is 13?
Travis: Misses.
Matt: And a 27.
Travis: That does hit.
Matt: You take five plus four, that's nine points of slashing damage, reduced to five, yeah. Round down, so it's four. Struck twice, missed both. Both of these guys are going to fire at-- one of them's going to fire at Sprigg on this end because it's their goal, here. With disadvantage, that is a 16? What's your AC again?
Darin: My AC is 19.
Matt: 19, yeah. It darts over you. It misses, it hits the side of the wall. The other guy's going to strike again with disadvantage. That's a 14. And you see the other guy pulling back with a crossbow and fire. You roll out of the way and it (arrow vibrating) into the wooden flooring right next to you.
Darin: Are there any traps that they hit?
Matt: No. That one is going to attack you, Vax, because you're right there in front of it. That's going to be a 13. Does not hit. Second strike, another 13. Both of its shortsword attacks, you duck out of the way and dodge, moving around very quickly. All righty. Those two right there, one of them is going to, because it saw that you got up, Scanlan, they're going to fire two bolts directly at you. That is a 16 to hit?
Sam: That hits.
Matt: Okay, and the second one is a 24.
Sam: Everything hits.
Matt: You are currently in base-to-base with one of their companions, so they both get sneak attack on you. 19 points of piercing damage from the first hit. 24 points of piercing damage from the second hit. And then they both duck around the side here.
Sam: What was the second one? 24.
Matt: They both, we'll say, they vanish from sight. You're not quite sure where they are right now. Those two also duck out of sight, not quite sure where they are, either. That ends their go. Now, the guy in the back right there, who noticed Vax show up, is going to, after you slaughter one of the guys, and stab the other one, is going to angrily go ahead and use Blight on you. Can you go ahead an make a constitution saving throw, please?
Liam: Natural 20. You fucking dick, necro guy!
Matt: All righty. That does half the damage.
Liam: It's still a lot.
Taliesin: I feel like a natural 20 should auto-fail this.
Laura: I know, right?
Matt: 21 points of necrotic damage to you.
Liam: All righty.
Matt: And is going to-- four, five, six. All righty. That ends his turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to run over to the window that those guys disappeared from.
Matt: Over this way or this way?
Laura: Right there, yeah. Can I see that motherfucker? Did I see him run past the window?
Matt: You know what? Yes, because he was not stealthing. You watch as he darts by, and you would have a shot, yeah.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to shoot at him. I'm going to Hunter's Mark him!
Matt: All righty, look at that!
Laura: Trinket doesn't have enough movement to get over by him, does he?
Matt: No, but Trinket can attack whatever's in your area, too.
Laura: I'm going to attack him with my Bramble Shot. With the Blazing Bowstring. Ooh, yeah. That's a 31.
Matt: 31? That hits!
Laura: Yes! Okay! Do I get sneak attack on him? I don't, do I?
Matt: No.
Laura: Damn! At least I got Hunter's Mark. Okay.
Liam: Hey Matt, I realized. I never shot out the wings, so I shouldn't have had as much movement as I did, so I think we should take the damage back from my last attack.
Matt: (counting). 50 to get up to the top there, so at your double speed, you'd be at 60, threw the dagger and threw the dagger. You're fine. It still works out.
Laura: Okay, 28 plus my 4d8 piercing damage. That's balls.
Matt: You're on deck, Keyleth, just so you know.
Laura: Seven, nine, plus nine is 37. 37 points of damage.
Matt: The first arrow hits him in the stomach, doubles forward and pulls back. Now, glancing over, saw you rush up and couldn't get out in time and now is going to try and back up as you're taking the second shot.
Laura: Does he roll a DC of over 17? A strength save?
Matt: Rolls a natural 17. Literally. Strength save? Minus one strength modifier. (cheering)
Matt: Oh, silly necromancer. You and your strength of nine. All right, so he is currently entangled in the brambles as the vines wrap around and pull him in, almost near the tree. You see the staff is pulled close to his chest.
Laura: Nice. Then I am going to shoot him. Oh, wait! I didn't add my Blazing Bowstring damage. Eight more for the Blazing Bowstring. And then I'm going to shoot him again. I'm just asking: do you get sneak attack damage if they're restrained?
Matt: You do, yeah. You can do that. You have advantage on the attack, remember, because he's restrained.
Laura: That's okay. Eight plus 14 is what? 32?
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Laura: Oh gosh! Okay! Ten, 11, 12, 13, plus sneak attack. 13. What's that? Ten. So 23. And then Hunter's Mark. Plus one. 24.
Matt: 24. Nice. The second arrow hits right in the throat, and you can see it doesn't hit anything vital, but you can see blood's starting to pour out. It's one of those things that if he were to pull it out, it would probably be very bad. But he's leaving it in right now. He's looking pretty rough.
Travis: The necromancer is?
Matt: Yeah. All righty. That ends your turn? Keyleth, your turn.
Laura: I'm going to step away from the window.
Matt: Okay. Step away from the window.
Laura: No, against the wall.
Matt: Against the wall there? You push the table back a bit; book almost falls off the top. What's Trinket doing?
Laura: Trinket is going to run over to Sprigg and Scanlan.
Matt: Up to Scanlan, or the guy who's there?
Laura: Just to the guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just try to growl at him and scare him because he can't attack him.
Taliesin: He's technically now engaged with the bear, so if he walks away, the bear gets an attack of opportunity.
Matt: That's true. That ends your turn. Trinket goes (roars) right in front of the creature. Keyleth, what are you doing?
Marisha: Okay. In my weird, emotional panic, Keyleth is going to turn and look around and she sees Vex firing a bow and Sprigg down on the floor, and she's upset, and she's just going to scream at the top of her lungs and do a Fire Storm around the building. Just (screams) and then I'm going to go (boof) where I think people might be in my rage.
Matt: Okay! So around the building where?
Marisha: Around the building. Sorry, Vax. I don't really know you're there, but around here and around here, and I'm sure I see Vex shooting at things, right? I'm going to try and go around.
Matt: So you have right here.
Marisha: Here, around, and that way.
Matt: All right. Okay, because you didn't see Vax outside.
Marisha: No. He's getting hit.
Matt: You saw Vax run upstairs.
Marisha: I just know there were people shooting through this window and through this window, so I'm doing a perimeter around.
Matt: How many squares is it? Ten, right?
Marisha: Ten ten-by-tens.
Matt: These two here get caught in it, as well as Vax and that guy there.
Laura: What about the magician guy?
Matt: If she's doing a perimeter? No.
Laura: Did you know that I was shooting at somebody?
Matt: She doesn't see the magician. Doesn't know where it is. "The Magician." The Prestige!
Liam: I have evasion.
Matt: Which means it's either half or nothing.
Liam: Right. At advantage because of the boots. What do I have to match?
Matt: Her DC, which is 21, right?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: Dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Oh yeah, way higher than that. We're good.
Matt: Yeah, you take no damage. You duck out of the Fire Storm just in time for it to (raging fire).
Marisha: I need two more d10s.
Liam: Yeah, dexterity save, man. Area effect.
Taliesin: Smoky d10 and spiky d10. And you get rerolls!
Marisha: I reroll ones. None of these are ones, unfortunately. (counting)
Darin: I just noticed the little lanterns glowing. Bravo!
Matt: Oh! Bravo to Dwarven Forge, man.
Sam: Well, it's your house.
Matt: True. Good torches you have in there.
Travis: Way to be energy-conscious with those LEDs!
Marisha: 39 fire damage.
Matt: 39 damage. This guy incinerates. He screams and burns. He manages to dodge partway out, but even the partial damage burns him and he (screams). You see him run off into the forest ten or so steps, on fire, like a stun man shot in a movie before he (impact) on the ground and smolders there in the distance. Those guys take it. What was the amount again?
Marisha: 39, and they're on fire.
Taliesin: It's hard to stealth when you're on fire.
Matt: They're both on fire.
Marisha: So that was my action. I'm going to do that out of my staff as I slam it down. I'm going to look at Sprigg and say: gods damn it, Sprigg! And I'm going to use that as my Healing Word, and I'm going to cast Healing Word at second level. Which is 2d4. 11 points to you. And then I'm going to use my free action that I have to turn into a fire elemental.
Matt: Your free action?
Marisha: Changing into something's not a bonus, it's a free action to change into my beast shape. Circle of the Moon, bitch!
Sam: Did you just call your fiancé--
Travis: -- a bitch?
Marisha: No! Combat wild shape.
Matt: Combat Wild Shape makes it a bonus action, as opposed to an action. That's the difference.
Liam: I would like to retract my "bitch," please.
Marisha: All right, so I'm just Keyleth.
Matt: Does that end your turn? All right, so as Keyleth's turn ends, it comes to Pike's. The entire exterior perimeter of this part of the house is on fire. Flames are now starting to catch. It is dry wood; the entire building is made from wood of the forest, so your home is now in flames.
Marisha: Wait, hang on. No, I'm doing the perimeter. I did think about this, which is why I didn't attack the guy in the house.
Travis: If you napalm the forest, the trees will probably catch fire.
Liam: It's a quick jump, though.
Matt: In order to do the perimeter, it's not a blazing inferno, but it's starting to catch. Flames are starting to lick up the sides.
Liam: End it quick, we can save it.
Matt: Fire Storm's a dangerous spell.
Laura: Let's try to save those books before they all burn.
Sam: He's an old guy. We were either going to kill him or burn his house down.
Matt: It's Vox Machina's MO, man!
Sam: It was always going to end this way.
Taliesin: Things you own end up owning you.
Darin: So glad I wore a jacket.
Matt: Pike is going to rush forward and is also going to attempt to Healing Word you at level two. It's a heal fountain on you. That is six plus five. That's 11 hit points you heal.
Sam: As soon as she does that, I grab him and we Dimension Door out the house.
Matt: Where do you Dimension Door?
Sam: To the only place I know  front of the house. Outside the front door. Not right outside, but towards the edge of the map there.
Matt: Over here?
Sam: Yeah, anywhere around there, on approach to the house.
Travis: Or do you want to be more over yonder?
Sam: Where's the front door to the house?
Marisha: Right there.
Sam: So I'd be 20 feet, the way we approached to the house. So where you got it, if that's the way we approached.
Matt: You guys approached this direction. So you're there. Make a perception check, Scanlan.
Sam: Okay. Ten.
Matt: Okay. You don't see the two hidden fellows over here. You see something large and hulking moving through the forest this direction, at a quick glance.
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Then we're going to be okay.
Matt: You guys have pulled out of that house. You're still on the ground and all of a sudden your body physically shifts, and you're looking up at the trees. You glance around and you can see the back of your house, you can hear the frantic fray going on. You see the necromancer who's currently covered in brambles and held in place. You see a couple of guys on fire, on the side screaming on the side of the house, and your house starting to catch fire. That's okay. Pike, on her turn, is going to--
Marisha: Keyleth has anger issues. It's fine.
Matt: Because it's a single target...
Sam: It's the "This is fine" meme, except it's just Keyleth.
Matt: She's going to cast a level five Guiding Bolt because that's what Pike does. So ranged spell attack against that guy. 11 plus-- yeah, that hits. That's a 21. So that is 8d6 radiant damage. Nice. 19.
Laura: Is she doing it to the magician?
Matt: No, this guy right there, in the room.
Sam: He's an illusionist, Laura.
Travis: Is she doing it against Copperfield? Is David Blaine with them?
Matt: So after she heals Sprigg, and Sprigg vanishes, she grabs her holy symbol and goes, "Chill out!" and shoots this giant flashing beam of divine energy that slams into it. You watch as a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact. It's still standing, but it's a shining beacon. The next attack against it has advantage. And then Pike's going to back up with you, Vex, towards the back where the bookcase is and goes, "You smell something?" You now hear, simultaneously, (slow thudding) and watch as the side wall and the back wall explode inward, as splinters of wood and stone (crashing) comes from this wall here--
Laura: Oh no, all of his stuff!
Marisha: So I didn't destroy your house first.
Liam: Flames! Flames, less of a thing.
Taliesin: On the side of the house.
Liam: Flames on the side of the house!
Matt: Two familiar hulking entities come barrelling into the chamber. Remember those giant things you saw walking through the Shadowfell that you barely avoided with the mask?
Marisha: The censer?
Matt: Who has the censer? Not on you right now. You don't carry a fucking giant smoking censer with you!
Laura: Oh, really? I didn't realize it was that big.
Taliesin: I think at that point, I think we put it in the Bag of Holding.
Sam: But you did make a bunch of those herbs.
Marisha: I do have the herbs.
Sam: And there's a shit-ton of shit on fire right now.
Matt: They burst through. (roaring) This big yell echoes through their metal masks. It sounds like this horrible-- imagine a giant vocal scream that's peaking on the audio level against a tinny metallic speaker.
Liam: (Bane voice) Your punishment will be more severe!
Matt: Essentially. This one's going to go after Keyleth. This one's going to make two swipes at Trinket because Trinket's right there. As they barrel through, part of the roof breaks. Guys up top, Percy and Grog, you feel the ground buckle a little bit below you and you drop about two or three inches as the building is starting to lose its physical frame.
Taliesin: Oh god, Grog, what did Keyleth do?
Travis: Thanks, Keyleth. You beat me by one second!
Taliesin: I'm well aware. It was totally worth it.
Marisha: #thanksKeyleth.
Matt: That's one's going to go ahead and do two slam attacks against Keyleth.
Marisha: Yeah, I've earned it. Come on!
Matt: That's 23 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah, that hits.
Matt: And that's a 29 to hit.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: That's 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first hit. And the second one is 30 points of bludgeoning damage. (two slams) And it slams you. The second fist actually pins you up against the wall there, and you feel ribs crack inside your chest and now-- they're both down low in this hulking mass. They're almost wider than they are any other dimension with how they're crouched down and the thickness of their body. They're taking up almost the entirety of the room right now.
Marisha: You said 30 points, right?
Matt: Yes, for the second one.
Marisha: So I'm at 83 points.
Matt: Correct. The other one's going to slam twice into Trinket. Giant fists. That's going to be a 28.
Laura: 28 hits.
Matt: And a 22.
Laura: 22 hits.
Matt: That is five plus six. 11 points of bludgeoning damage to Trinket.
Laura: Halved.
Matt: Halved, correct. And 22 points of bludgeoning damage, halved.
Laura: Okay, so 11 plus six is 27 points.
Matt: That ends their go. We're at the top of the round. Percy, you're upstairs.
Taliesin: Okay, this all happened. That's awkward. That's okay, I know where I am. I'm going to run out onto the balcony really quick.
Marisha: There's room over here.
Travis: That guy's still up there with us, right?
Taliesin: Yeah. I figure you're going to handle him. Grog, take care of these two. What do I see outside on the balcony?
Matt: You see, currently down below-- make a perception check. Actually, you wouldn't even see them from your perspective.
Taliesin: I just rolled a natural 20.
Matt: Right, it's blocking your vision from this side. You do see Scanlan, you see Sprigg who is currently conscious, you see this necromancer who is currently held with brambles, and you see two streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the building.
Taliesin: Weird question, really quickly. Where is that giant log trap?
Matt: Right there.
Taliesin: How much swing does it have? Is it locked all the way over here, or is it hung back there?
Matt: It looks more like a drop.
Taliesin: Oh, so it's a drop on the door. Good to know. In the meantime, I'm going to run on the exterior of the wall, like right over here, if that makes sense. That's going to be my movement. I'm going to take some fun, happy pot shots at these bastards.
Laura: At the necromancer?
Taliesin: At the necromancer! Let's start with that bound necromancer. He's fun.
Liam: With the Vecna eye.
Taliesin: With the Vecna eye. He's bound, so I have advantage to hit him?
Matt: Yes, you do.
Taliesin: All right, I'm going to use my Animus gun so I still have a hand open, and I'm also going to burn a point of grit so that I can get him to drop his staff. Here we go with advantage. Oh darn, it was so close. 28.
Matt: That hits.
Taliesin: That's-- ooh! Fancy. 18 points of damage, four points of psychic damage, and he has to make a strength saving throw or drops his items.
Matt: Oh, don't worry, he drops the staff, because there's not much left of his head. When you hit the arm, the staff's clutching, but you slam it and it hits the side of the head and causes the right side of the face to explode against the tree, the brambles still clutching as it falls limp to the ground, and they crush the body into a small rock of flesh.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Marisha: You get a grit point back, right?
Laura: You get a grit point back, you get a grit point back!
Matt: You just barely see them; they have three-quarters cover. But you have sharpshooter.
Taliesin: Three-quarters cover, what does that mean in this crazy world? I'm going to burn a grit for advantage and shoot one of them.
Matt: The one right furthest on the side there?
Taliesin: Yeah. I'll start there. Let's give it a shot. I love advantage; it's so wonderful. 32. I really should have done extra damage. So that's 1d10 plus six. That hits, obviously. 32 to hit?
Matt: Yeah, that hits. Goodbye, necromancer.
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: How much was that, sorry?
Taliesin: 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: Okay. All right, he's still standing. (bullet impact, yelps) He starts looking up to see where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound through the torso and out the back of the shoulder was clean through. You hear him breathing, gasping for breath. (gasping)
Taliesin: I'm going to take another shot at him. I'm going to make this a sharpshooter shot, and again with advantage because that's fun. Here we go. Damn! Almost a crit. That's 29. That hits.
Matt: That hits, yeah. Go ahead and roll damage.
Taliesin: 14 points of damage-- I'm sorry, 24 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage.
Matt: He falls to the ground, face first. The second shot hits him in the chest. He just goes down, crumples. His body begins to smolder.
Taliesin: I use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me.
Matt: That ends Percival's turn. Grog, you're up. You hear, downstairs, the (heavy thudding). There's the guy in front of you who's like, (angry breathing). What are you going to do?
Travis: Can I smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself?
Matt: You can! And your head goes into the roof! (thudding)
Marisha: We're real sorry about your house.
Darin: It wasn't a house. It was a prison.
Laura: Well, then you're welcome.
Travis: I'm hoping the floor gives.
Matt: The floor gives out. As your head (crashing) into the ceiling (creaking, crashing) it falls out from under you. You come falling down on top of this guy. Rubble falls around. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. I need Trinket to make a dexterity saving throw. The other shadow ghast fails.
Marisha: Nine.
Laura: 14.
Matt: Trinket, you, and the shadow ghast all take 22 points of bludgeoning damage as the roof caves in over on top. Large part of the upper floor now falls and this guy stumbles and is now prone there. He also takes damage. You take 22 points of bludgeoning damage from falling through the wreckage. Trinket's is halved, yes.
Marisha: Ugh, debris, ugh!
Matt: That kills him. The shadow ghast right here.
Travis: Because he had barely any left.
Matt: Yeah. He's like, "Huh?" (crashing) Gets rained on with rubble, broken, splintered wood and stone.
Travis: The guy in Manners, he fell too, right?
Matt: His part of the ceiling didn't fully collapse. He's just out of the way. He's dangling off the edge right now, as he shakes, it's making its way towards the hole. The whole ceiling didn't collapse, just the area right below.
Travis: Beautiful. Can I take Tweedledee to my right and make two reckless attacks against him? They're not giants, right?
Matt: No, they're not giants. They're considered undead.
Travis: They're considered undead. 30 to hit. And the second one.
Matt: Big targets.
Travis: 29.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: So ten. 24 points. Plus the Enlarge-- 25.
Matt: 25 with the first hit. (whack)
Travis: 22 with the second one.
Matt: 22 damage on the second hit. (whacks) You're hitting him. Laying on its back, it has these metal spikes jamming out of its flesh. You can see portions of other creatures that it had slain that have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away on its armor. So as you're hitting it, you're knocking away parts of partially decomposed creatures that previously fell in battle to one of these creatures. As you're slamming into it, you can see it's just rippling, partially decayed muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched together and alive. It's a thick sack of hit points.
Travis: Wow. Cool. Good to know.
Matt: Is that your turn; are you doing anything else?
Travis: That's interesting. I'm going to go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action.
Matt: Okay, and that's the end of your turn? Okay. End of Grog's turn. Vax, you're up. You heard all this go on and now the whole building is starting to catch fire.
Liam: I'm going to bolt to that window.
Matt: Right there?
Liam: No, other way. So I have a view of Keyleth, the creature, and Grog. I'm going to throw Whisper-- I've got sharpshooter-- at that thing, and bamf there.
Matt: I will say, at proximity to the flames that are starting to catch, you do take three points of fire damage.
Liam: Fine.
Matt: You threw the dagger at the big guy?
Liam: Whisper goes to the window at that guy there.
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Liam: And it's flanking, right? Because of where Grog is, or Keyleth?
Matt: It's not flanking, but you get to add sneak attack modifier.
Liam: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That's 32.
Matt: Yeah, that hits. So you appear next to it.
Liam: Three plus psychic damage is four plus this junk. (counting) 33, doubled to 66 plus psychic damage is 74. Bamf there.
Matt: And you appear next to it. As the dagger sinks into its torso, you watch as its chest muscles and the iron cage-like armor around it seems to swallow the dagger. As it goes inside, you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden (squelch) fall off of its body, like whatever energy's holding it together is untethered and this weird, fleshy, stitched-together creature is starting to fall apart. It's looking pretty hurt.
Liam: Okay, so here's what I wanted to do. So movement-- and I have action-action, action, action-- action-action, action, bonus action.
Travis: (repeating) Action, action--
Laura: (repeating) Action, action--
Marisha: (repeating) Action, action--
Liam: Guys, it's the rules in the book! You can bust my balls all you want--
Matt: Well, that's your first attack, so you have your second attack.
Liam: So action-action for my regular attack, right?
Matt: Attack-attack!
Liam: It's just semantics. Attack-attack, hasted action, bonus action. So that was the first of my attack-attacks. And here's the second one.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: 30.
Matt: Well, we have dagger, dagger, dagger. Now we have attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack as our next t-shirt. (laughter)
Liam: I'm dumping a level two Smite into this, against an undead. That's seven, 10, 11. Ooh, it's cocked. 17 for that hit.
Matt: 17 with the additional--?
Liam: With attack-attack.
Matt: Right. Well, but you said you dumped Divine Smite into that?
Liam: Into that one.
Matt: You did the additional damage for it being undead? Okay, so that was how much total?
Liam: Whatever I just said. It was like 16.
Travis: 17.
Matt: 17. 17 will do it, actually. So as you rush in with the second dagger, you jam up into the same space where it's falling apart, and you hear this dull (shockwave sound) on the inside as the divine energy radiates from the strike and its body (slurping) sloughs off of the bones and around your arm. It slowly falls around your arm like old gelatin and (slurping) slips into the ground, covering the floor around you.
Liam: Okay, I'm going to do the old crouch. Not that she needs it, but crouch in front of Keyleth. And then I have my hasted action for an attack and bonus action for an attack into the other one. 29, and the second one is higher than 29. I'm going to dump Smite into it. Three-- you're making me mess up the math, Laura!
Laura: Psychic damage.
Liam: (laughing) I can't keep track of the math!
Matt: (singing) Epic-level DND!
Liam: 25 on that towards that guy, with Smite added. And then the last dagger, with Smite, at level one, is two plus is 10, 14, 19.
Matt: 19, okay.
Liam: I dumped a ton of Smite into that.
Matt: You didn't add your modifier to the third strike, right?
Liam: I don't know, so why don't you just minus six? 19, so we'll call it 13. Some people might have been catcalling me while I was trying to do math.
Matt: That's okay. No worries. You hit with the two final strikes. They blast into it. You watch as some of the armor gets thrown off its body. It takes a little hit, but the other creature looks like it's largely all right. That finishes Vax's turn.
Liam: Let me enjoy my last two months of life!
Matt: Shadow ghast. What's the DC on the sphere again?
Sam: 20.
Matt: Is it 20? 19. He can't escape from this freaking sphere. The shadow ghast is up on the second floor going (growling). Manners, man. All right. Scanlan and Sprigg, what do you guys want to do?
Darin: I have a question. The gentleman who had an arrow in his throat: he's gone, right? He's been blown apart.
Matt: Yeah. Actually, make a perception check.
Darin: Okay. That's a d20, isn't it?
Matt: Yep, d20 and then add your perception modifier.
Darin: Got it. That's a 17.
Matt: A 17, okay. You glance over and you see two guys who are hiding amongst the bushes on the side there.
Darin: Now, it's too far away to cast a spell.
Matt: No, depending on the spell's range, depending on what you want to do.
Darin: Tasha's Hideous Laughter.
Matt: That we can do.
Marisha: That's such a good spell.
Matt: It's a fun one. So bringing up Tasha's here, looking at the range. There we go. It's a 30-feet range, so you want to get up and get a little closer, probably.
Darin: I will do that, if I could.
Matt: All right, so that's half your movement, and you can move two more spaces. You can hit one guy. So one guy of these two you can select.
Darin: The first one.
Matt: That one there? All righty.
Darin: Yes. I think his name is Dave? Roll a perception?
Matt: Make a saving throw, a wisdom save. That is a ten! Your spell DC is a 17. You watch as the guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you get up, spins around, has this giant, heavy crossbow, the bolt very recognizable because you still have three of them in your body. Aims it towards you and then suddenly (maniacal laughter) and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles over laughing, falling to the ground and is now kicking and laughing like a hyena right now, unable to do anything.
Darin: Knock knock!
Matt: (maniacal laughter)
Darin: Right! (laughter)
Matt: All right, is that your turn?
Darin: Yes, it is.
Matt: All right.
Sam: There's another guy over there? Have I seen him yet?
Matt: You haven't, actually. You do see this guy's on fire right now, who is still around.
Sam: Oh, I see somebody.
Matt: Yeah, and you can see that hulking figure come running through, and you hear the (explosion) through the back of the building.
Sam: For the beginning of the round, I'll say, guys, I think large giants are coming. Be aware.
Laura: (screaming)
Travis: (screaming)
Sam: What? I can't hear you! Speak clearly!
Liam: Threepio! Where could he be?!
Sam: Okay. Shit. I'll approach the guy I can see burning, on fire. That's where the front door is, right? Is he in front of the front door?
Matt: The log is right up in this area.
Sam: Oh yeah. That. So I'll take out my Wand of Magic Missiles, and I will just take down the rope.
Matt: Okay. You watch as three missiles fire out of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top. As they explode, it's enough of an impact to cause it, as opposed to fall straight down, just spin and fall. I'm going to go ahead and roll a dice to see which direction it's going to land from its front point. So we'll say inward would be one, two, three, four, five, six. That's a six. So it plummets down, hits the ceiling, scrapes off and slams down onto him. He's going to try and make a dexterity saving throw. That is a seven plus four, nope. That's an 11. Go ahead and roll 4d8 please.
Laura: 4d8?
Darin: Is this Dr. Comedy, who's writhing in laughter?
Matt: I think so. Oh. No, sorry, he's over here. This guy's on fire from her earlier.
Sam: Oh, that's a five. 16.
Matt: 16 points of damage to him.
Sam: That's not a lot.
Laura: You only got 16 on 4d8?
Matt: It's not enough to kill him, but it slams on him and then falls over. You see as both of his flaming hands on the ground going, (groans). He's currently restrained underneath it right there, and on fire.
Darin: Knock knock. (laughter)
Matt: All right, you going to stay where you are?
Sam: No. I'm going to move towards any entrance or window I see. I can't really see over there.
Matt: There's a window here, window here. This one has flames in front of it. This one's available.
Sam: I'll go towards that [no audio] other one.
Matt: Okay. Four, five. That's as far as you can move there. You see the guy on the ground who's laughing in front of you.
Sam: Yeah, no thanks to him. And for a bonus, I guess I will inspire Darin De Paul, or rather, Sprigg.
Liam: Why not both?
Sam: I will sing to him, (singing) You had a bad day, you gettin' knocked down. I sing you a song just to turn it around! You say you don't know, but please don't die. I'll sing you this song and maybe you'll go for a ride. You had a bad day. (speaking) I don't know how that song goes.
Matt: All righty, so you get an inspiration die. You get a d12 that you can use on any sort of skill. You don't have to use it right now, but whenever you use a skill check or an ability check you can add that to it if you want to. There you go.
Darin: Thank you. You know, I had a bad day.
Sam: (singing) You had a bad day. (groaning and laughing)
Matt: All right, so now it's the assassin's turn. Keyleth, how much fire damage does it do when they're on fire? Is it d10?
Marisha: (stuttering) Oh jeez. Fire Storm. Yeah, no. d10.
Matt: Thought so. All right, he takes eight fire damage.
Taliesin: Yay! Under a log.
Matt: Under a log. He's going to try and break free from restraint. Nope, that is a 14. He cannot move that giant tree that's currently crushing him on the ground. He tries to reach out for his crossbow and aim it out towards Sprigg with one hand because it's still loaded. But he has super disadvantage on this strike.
Sam: Super disadvantage. Is that in the book?
Matt: It is now.
Laura: That's in the new campaign guide. Super disadvantage. Only when you're stuck under a tree on fire.
Matt: Sure, I'll do all three. All right. Eight, 12, 12. I made him roll super disadvantage. What does this remind me of? Like a terrible old sci-fi movie where the bad guy's on the ground with the gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final shot and the hero just walks up and steps on the gun. You (whoosh) sidestep the bolt as it fires. Nothing on you.
Darin: Of course.
Matt: The crossbow drops, (grunting).
Darin: Knock knock.
Matt: (crying) On fire. All righty, that ends his turn.
Darin: (whispering) Comedy comes in threes.
Matt: This guy back here is going to go ahead and since you're the one who has his friend writhing on the ground, is going to go ahead and try to shoot you with his crossbow. You do see him, although he's unaware of that, so he thinks it's a sneak attack shot. That is a 14.
Taliesin: You got to get better cultists, man.
Matt: I know, seriously. They come in large numbers, so yeah. This one just (impact sound) hits the tree to your left. His aim's off.
Travis: He's missing an eye. His depth perception sucks.
Matt: Exactly. And he goes ahead and darts behind this building there, vanishing.
Sam: Did I see the bolt or any indication that he exists?
Matt: You do. He reveals himself when he fires. So you watched him come out of the bushes and (whoosh) fire and then duck around the side of the building. The guy on the ground is going to try and save against your spell. That is a 13 plus zero. Nope. He's still laughing. He's just on the ground, (laughing). Tears in his eyes now.
Taliesin: I love that spell.
Matt: That's the end of the assassins' turn. Necro's dead. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I'm going to Hunter's Mark the big undead monster in the room. And then I'm going to shoot him! With the Blazing Bowstring!
Taliesin: Be careful. You might catch the building on fire.
Laura: Oh, but I'm going to use the sharpshooter thing.
Matt: Take minus five and do additional damage? Okay.
Laura: Which I don't know if I should have done that on this particular one. It was 17 to hit.
Matt: 17 is exactly his armor class.
Liam: Yas, Pelor queen! (laughter)
Laura: Five plus eight is 13. Plus sneak attack, because he's got Trinket next to him. 13, 18, 23, sorry! 23 and then lightning damage. 24. 25, 26. And then Blazing Bowstring. God dang! 27.
Matt: Okay, 27. So that's your first strike. (arrow shot) First one just (impact sound) hits in the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out and the flames burn up the arrow. By the way, the wall behind you is starting to get really warm.
Laura: I'm going to move forward. I'm going to actually move toward the corner where Keyleth is.
Matt: There's a guy on the ground there.
Laura: Oh, there is?
Matt: Yeah. So you've got to step over him.
Laura: I'm going to step on him.
Matt: As you move past, he does get a swing with his shortsword at you. Oh, wow. That's a 25.
Laura: Oh, wow. He hits me. Probably because I stepped on him.
Matt: I think so. So you take nine points of slashing damage. Just like, (pain sound) as you're walking past.
Laura: (pain sound) Fuck. Ah, shit. Okay, I'm going to hit the big hulking thing again.
Matt: I realized he had disadvantage, but I rolled another 18, so it's fine.
Laura: Oh, okay, well, yeah. I'm going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 25 to hit.
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: Oh, I didn't add plus ten to the previous one!
Matt: Because of the sharpshooter, all right. 39 last time. So go ahead and take a swing at it.
Laura: Thanks! 14.
Matt: You're up next, Keyleth.
Laura: 14 plus six is 20.
Sam: Figure out how you're going to ruin Darin's life more.
Marisha: I know. That's my one goal in life. I'm a big old homewrecker.
Laura: I think that's just 32 because I don't get sneak attack again.
Matt: All right. So the second arrow slams into him. It's still holding firm. It's taking the hits and you see parts of its body are starting to spill black liquid out of the wounds and (growls) its red eyes still beaming out from behind the metal mask in front of its face. Its arm swings back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with it. It's looking pretty rickety right now. So that ends your turn?
Laura: I guess so.
Marisha: Is it in a fireproof safe? No? Okay!
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: All right. So I have this big asshole in front of me, yeah? The house is catching on fire, right? Yeah. Nope, she'd still be really upset and really angry. So continuing what I was saying before, she's gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Unable to contain her frustration--
Taliesin: This is a good plan.
Matt: You technically entered the space of the guy who's on the ground, becoming a fire elemental, which lights him on fire. (screams)
Marisha: Even more upset. I'm gonna move right in the space of this guy.
Matt: (whoosh) So occupying his space from this side, we'll say. She can catch you guys on fire.
Laura: But she doesn't have to.
Matt: I'll double-check that real fast.
Marisha: I mean, I'm magical.
Taliesin: Sparkle fire.
Marisha: I sparkle fire.
Liam: Also, we can take it.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's fire.
Matt: You know what? It can move through a space as narrow as one inch wide, so I'll say yes, you can maneuver through. Only if you want to, can you set things on fire.
Marisha: I'm going to go into this guy's space, engulf in flames, and do my multi-attack, two slam touch attacks.
Matt: Go for it. He is now in flames.
Marisha: That's cocked. Ooh, that's good, that's good. 21.
Matt: 21, yeah.
Marisha: And 16.
Matt: 16 just misses.
Marisha: Fucking balls. Okay. No, plus six to 11. That's 17.
Matt: That hits. That's what you needed.
Marisha: So both of those hit. 2d6 plus three. First one is eight. Plus ten. 18 fire damage.
Matt: He's looking pretty hurt. As you slam him with both of your flaming hands and claw across his body, where the flame hits, you see it (hissing) singes through the flesh and drags charred remains of where the muscle once was where you dragged your claws through. The body's starting to shake as it's holding its form together.
Marisha: That's all I've got, I think. That's it.
Sam: No. You have action, action, action, action, action. (laughter)
Marisha: Bonus action.
Taliesin: Bonus action.
Laura: Hasted action.
Liam: Send all your complaints to Mike Mearls and Chris Perkins at Wizards of the Coast.
Sam: Matt, not to be a dick, but has anyone stepped on the trap on the floor?
Matt: Actually, you know what, Vax would have avoided it. Because Vax is in the spot where it was, but Vax knew where it was, so Vax would have probably gone over it.
Sam: So cool. You're doing the little splits over it.
Liam: Splitsing. Van Damme-ing it.
Matt: Wait, you wouldn't have, because when you threw the dagger--
Liam: Let's do it.
Matt: It's not a big deal. Thank you for pointing that out.
Sam: But your boots are gone.
Liam: She stole them again? How did you do it?
Matt: You guys glance upward as you hear a (deep swoosh) and up above you in the hole in the ceiling where there once was nothing but air, you see hovering above you a giant beholder just appear. (guttural moan) All of its eyestalks curling around it.
Marisha: What do you mean, it's not a big deal? That's the part that I'm confused about!
Matt: Thank you for that. So that finishes your turn, Keyleth. Pike's turn. Pike sees this--
Liam: If we're retconning that in, I'm retconning (blows raspberry) when I see it.
Darin: Don't get Gargamel angry.
Marisha: Does that mean that Keyleth would have seen the beholder beforehand? You know what, don't worry about it.
Matt: No. You were so angry-- it's in the hole above. You don't quite see where that hole was at the moment, you backed away.
Marisha: Man, so much blind rage.
Matt: So much blind rage. Look guys, that's what we're doing. So anyway, Pike does actually make an insight check, and says, "It's not real. Don't worry about it!"
Laura: Thanks, Pike.
Matt: Fixed. (laughter)
Laura: It's not a big deal, you guys.
Matt: Pike, however, is going to go ahead and make another Guiding Bolt at the large guy there. That's going to be a 20. That hits. That's going to be 4d6. 14 points of radiant damage, which will do it. So you watch as Pike blasts it in the face with the Guiding Bolt. As it hits, the mask gets thrown off, and where the head was beneath it, you see this empty black void with two red burning coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask is removed, and the whole body crumples to the ground and turns into a horrible, thick, black-purple ichor.
Laura: I'm going to have nightmares about that.
Sam: For sure.
Matt: The beholder is still upstairs, staying in place going (hoarse screaming). (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, it's that kind of thing.
Taliesin: Brilliant.
Matt: That ends Pike's turn. They're both dead. That brings us back. Percival, it's your turn. There's the one guy on the ground there. One's laughing. We'll say for the purposes of this, for the time, most everything there is not much of a threat at this point. So systematically, the guy on the ground who's hidden by the tree, you can just--
Taliesin: I'm ignoring him. I'm not even gonna deal. I'm just hopping in the window. I'm going to grab my little guy there. I'm going to bring him out to the balcony, and I'm going to unceremoniously toss him out of the house.
Sam: Defenestrated!
Matt: You throw him (thud). He lands.
Taliesin: And then I'm going to jump and I'm going to crawl down the rest of my way and join him outside the house. And try and jump around the fire, dragging him away from the fire.
Matt: Make an athletics check. Sorry, acrobatics check.
Taliesin: Acrobatics? Bless you for an acrobatics check. I'm rerolling that.
Matt: No, it's not a saving throw. You can't do that.
Taliesin: It's not a saving throw. Oh well, that's fine. That's a 16.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of this--
Taliesin: I had the Spider Climb boots.
Matt: Right, I know. But Spider Climb boots only helps you if you keep on the surface. So as you leap, you manage to land on your feet, but the flames do catch you a bit, so you take six points of fire damage as you start to burn. For the purposes of time on this one, the guy who's currently under the log just burns to death there under the log. Pinned, he's trying to reach for his crossbow, but he's only fired the one bolt that was loaded in it. The guy on the ground is still laughing as you approach him.
Darin: Are there any rocks about?
Matt: Yeah, there's quite a few heavier rocks on the ground.
Darin: Well, I look at him, and I say, "It was a prison, but it was my prison." And I use the Telekinesis ring to lift a rock and drop it on his head.
Matt: (splat) A horrible sickening crack sound. It slams into the head. You lift it up. The laughing has stopped, but he's still moving and you can see the face is broken. The nose is smashed to the side and it's just blood. He's starting to try and get back up.
Darin: Well, tell them that Ethred Brokenbranch sends his regards.
Matt: Do you let him get up?
Darin: Yes.
Matt: He gets up. (grunting)
Sam: I'll Lightning Bolt him as he runs away.
Matt: Okay, we'll say for the purposes of this, he runs off in the distance (footsteps, yelp) and falls to the ground, no longer moving.
Travis: Can I kill the guy on the floor? Can he be mine, please? Can I please smash him? The guy that's lying on the floor in the house, please?
Taliesin: Just sit on him.
Travis: I haven't Gallaghered anybody in a while.
Matt: He's on the ground on fire now, going (frantic gasps) patting out the fire.
Laura: Oh, Grog, put him out!
Matt: He spends his action putting the fire out now, and is like, (frantic gasps).
Marisha: Keyleth takes a few steps back and motions as a fire elemental...
Travis: I skip on in and (gibberish yell).
Matt: He's like, (scream, impact). Just smashed on the ground. Red watermelon.
Laura: Fire's out, I'm assuming.
Marisha: I drop my fire form, turn, see my anger, destruction, get immediately guilty, and then do a Tidal Wave to quell the flames.
Matt: The building is standing, mostly. The whole front of it is blackened. The flames are gone. Most of the interior is destroyed. You have two giant holes in the back. Most of the upper ceiling is ruined. The house is in shambles.
Laura: What about the books?
Matt: A lot of them have been destroyed. Some of the ones on the back wall have been burned. Some of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled out. The house is pretty wrecked.
Laura: Can I go over to them and see if I can find some books I think Percy would like?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'm running over to see that staff with an eye in it.
Laura: 27.
Matt: 27? Okay. You start glancing through. You find some history books. You find some that relate to local history. You see some books that relate to various types of creatures; some animals and beasts. Many that are encyclopedias of various rivers and it's scattered everywhere. It's just universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can get his hands on. So some of it seems less useful than others but you hand-pick a few out that you think Percy would like.
Travis: I don't mean to ask the obvious question, but how did he know we were here?
Taliesin: No, that's not an obvious question. I have no idea.
Marisha: They have multiple eyes.
Laura: But how? Was he watching us? Is he scrying on us?
Taliesin: Must have.
Laura: Oh, he's fucking scrying on us.
Taliesin: Maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him.
Matt: You get the sense that's not how this works.
Taliesin: Yeah. I don't know.
Marisha: He had another eye, right?
Sam: Does that thing have an eye in it?
Matt: The staff you see? It's a carved eye. It's made of wood and paint. It's ornamental. It's mainly used as a focus, technically acts as a plus-one staff.
Travis: Sprigg. You said this place was a prison. Did you mean that?
Darin: Of course I meant it, boy. I've been there for years.
Travis: Could you leave? If you wanted.
Darin: Of course I can. The prison was more up here than in there.
Travis: Oh. Sorry about the prison, then.
Darin: Why would you be sorry? I asked you for power and redemption. Don't you feel you gave me that? We lived, child. We all lived.
Travis: Yep. Yes. That is indeed what I was hoping for.
Laura: I lean out the window. Hey, Sprigg!
Darin: Hello!
Laura: Hi.
Darin: Hi! How are you? I have some arrows in me at the moment. You like arrows, don't you?
Laura: I do. Come in here, I'll take them off your hands.
Darin: Okay. Question  if you do that, I'd probably die again.
Laura: I'll cure you, darling. Don't worry.
Darin: She called me darling.
Sam: She's the cutest.
Darin: (growls) I go in. (laughter)
Matt: You walk into your destroyed abode, managing to sidestep all the bear traps along the way. You've walked the path many times and you know it and I'm actually surprised none of you walked into any of them. You knew where most of them were, but none of you wandered out far enough into the open to do that. They're all inside. You can see your giant friend, of course, that you were talking to as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier. Previously where you had to hunch, you're now having to almost belly crawl inside the house.
Travis: But why? There's no separation between the first and the second floor.
Matt: So if you stand in that space, you're fine.
Travis: I'm in my space.
Taliesin: I'm going to prop our idiot up in the window so I can go in and keep an eye on him even while I'm inside.
Sam: We have a prisoner?
Taliesin: Yeah. I kept one.
Laura: But he's one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesn't speak.
Matt: And in the last minute or so has not been able to break free but is still trying.
Taliesin: He automatically fails until 24 hours has elapsed.
Matt: After the first failed save?
Taliesin: Any further attempts by the creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed. He ain't going nowhere. It's mean, man.
Laura: Me and Pike can heal him as I take the arrows out.
Matt: Okay.
Darin: At last you've seen the point of me, eh?
Laura: (sarcastic laugh) Sprigg, anything valuable in here that you want to save before we get you out of here?
Darin: Would like my organs! Oh, I would like to save those.
Laura: Yes.
Darin: All right. No. There's nothing.
Laura: No keys to Ioun? You know where she is?
Darin: I might. I hope I do. I hope that I can give you the answers you seek.
Laura: I hope so, too. I cast Cure Wounds.
Matt: Pike casts Cure Wounds on you, as well, and you heal 18.
Darin: Do I know her name yet?
Matt: No, you do not.
Darin: Cleric.
Matt: "Pike."
Darin: Yes. Ethred. Or Sprigg. Whichever you like. You can call me Sprigg. Can you help me pray to Ioun? We need answers, and I think together we might find them.
Matt: "I can certainly try. Do you have any items of her iconography?"
Darin: Do I?
Matt: Yeah, actually. You just reach over and find one of the undamaged books.
Laura: You healed 19, by the way.
Darin: Thank you. Use this and you talk to her where I can't. At least, not yet.
Matt: "I don't know if I can talk to her. I'm not... But I can help you pray. I don't know if it'll be enough."
Darin: Let's give it a go. There's a first time for everything.
Matt: "Grog!"
Travis: Yeah?
Matt: "Can you help me clear some of the floor, please?"
Travis: Not a problem! (grunting) Keyleth, catch!
Marisha: Ah! Ow! (laughter)
Sam: Floorboards! In her face!
Travis: I thought you were on fire. I'm really sorry.
Matt: Pike takes you over to the center of the room and tells you. "Kneel with me. Now take this book and close your eyes and... apologize."
Darin: For what?
Matt: "For everything you said about Ioun."
Darin: (grumbles) All right. Well, look the other way. Find some things that are of value.
Travis: (whistles)
Laura: Trinket sits down next to him and stares, but I'll turn around.
Darin: All right. I don't know if you're listening, Ioun. It's been many years since I've actually spoken to a god. I'd like to express my deepest sorrow. You see, this home... didn't mean as much to me as life. And I think these people gave that to me. If you could give us... If you could give me anything, any little hint, it would be greatly appreciated and I would be a warrior in your name forevermore. Please. Was that okay, bear?
Matt: (huffs, licking) Licks the side of your face.
Darin: No, I'm not crying. You're crying, bear.
Matt: You sit there in silence with your eyes closed, concentrating, holding the book before you. Doesn't seem to be an answer. Just silence in the darkness. Nothing. Everyone wants to look at him-- still turned away?
Marisha: Keyleth is definitely staring, but pretending not to stare.
Taliesin: I'm watching through the book.
Laura: I'm leaning against the wall and staring at him now.
Matt: Nothing. Nothing responds. As you have your eyes closed, you hear this soft chuckle in the far corner of the room. (cackles) "Really? Praying, are you?"
Darin: Yes. Can you help?
Matt: "Do I look the kind of guy that would help?"
Darin: Yes. I've known you for 19 years and I think anybody's capable of anything, so why don't you do something unexpected?
Matt: "I think you're right. It's no longer your prison. It's not mine, either."
Darin: That's true.
Matt: (flapping) Flies out the window.
Taliesin: Oh shit.
Darin: Kraghammer has another performer, and not a very good one.
Matt: While you've been talking, by the way, and the silence has been sad. Taking in the slight emotional cut that not getting a response and putting yourself on that limb means nothing. The rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright blue.
Marisha: What? Is it really?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Your stomach is glowing.
Darin: Growing? What? I didn't eat anything. How could my stomach be growing?
Sam: You're blue balling.
Darin: What?
Sam: (whispering) Look down.
Matt: Pike looks at you and takes your hands and opens your arms and motions to your chest. And the book in your hand, you pull aside. You glance down and you can see, there's this soft, bluish glow that's emanating from your torso. Strange.
Darin: You see? I didn't have to believe in Ioun. I've found my religion. (chuckling) I'm Bluish! (laughter)
Travis: Aw, man!
Darin: It didn't happen!
Matt: No, it did. That's canon.
Darin: Wait a second, gentlemen. We'll restart for just a second. It'll be fine. That little imp is gone. So apparently, the key... is me.
Laura: Is you? It is you.
Sam: Is in you or is you?
Marisha: It is him. I've known it from the minute that I laid eyes upon him. It's him.
Travis: You did? You knew that the moment you saw him?
Marisha: No, I mean I had a hunch, I had a feeling, deep down inside. I can't say it. If I say it out loud and then if it's not true then I'm an asshole.
Liam: To be fair, we've only been here 12 minutes.
Darin: Yes. House gone. The imp gone. Burny, burny. Sad, sad. Pray, nothing happened. Now I'm blue. That's a day for you, isn't it?
Laura: So do you glow brighter the closer we get? What's the deal here?
Darin: I've never glowed before, child.
Laura: I think it's glown.
Darin: I've never glowned.
Sam: If you're the key, where's the lock? Where do we take you?
Darin: Well, I have been gone for many, many years, so English may have changed. To be fair. To be fair. I don't know. This is all new to me. I would have thought it would be in one of those tomes.
Taliesin: I'm going to pick up the book that he was holding when he was praying. I'm going to just try and read it.
Matt: Okay. You glance through it. The book is a simple book, talking about the construction of barricades and it looks like it was less the contents of the book and more just the image of the book itself.
Taliesin: I'm going to hand him the book again and see if maybe there's focus to be found. Maybe this is--
Matt: Okay. Make a perception check.
Taliesin: Oh, lord. Ooh. Let's call that a 28.
Matt: When you took the book from him and handed him another book, there was a very faint vibration to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it back to him. Which you haven't noticed, but there's a physical vibration to him.
Taliesin: If it's all-- with your permission, I'm going to take his hands.
Matt: Okay. You feel them, and you feel this very faint vibration to his body.
Marisha: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes.
Marisha: Continue holding his hands. I pull out the Tome of Quick Movement. Hold. Hold while I find the paper. Hold.
Laura: What if he's a tuning fork?
Marisha: (shushes)
Darin: That's very rude.
Marisha: Where is it? I have a lot of things.
Sam: Divining.
Darin: Oh yes. A divining rod. A rod to the divine. Perhaps I am a divining rod.
Laura: That's what I mean.
Darin: Well said, child!
Marisha: I pull out the fork we that we got to get to Elysium. Is it similar?
Matt: When you pull out the fork and you hold it, you recall that whenever you cast the spell Plane Shift, there was a faint vibration to the specific fork when you cast the spell.
Sam: He's the tuning fork.
Taliesin: He's the tuning fork.
Marisha: Oh no.
Laura: What, no? This is good!
Marisha: No, it is good. It's good, it's just... Oh, Sprigg. No, it's fine. It's good. I don't know. Everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it. So I hope he's not something that can be used and discarded.
Darin: I haven't been used in 37 years.
Marisha: Sprigg.
Darin: It's all right. At least I wasn't discarded all that time.
Marisha: I'm sure it's fine, I just--
Darin: Look. Look at me. Just remember. Whatever happens, remember me. That's all that's important.
Liam: That's good advice.
Darin: That's all that we have. My friends are gone and I don't even remember their names. I don't remember Thetapax or Zephyr or... the guy with the nose. He was my favorite. (coughs and sniffles) Dusty in here, isn't it?
Marisha: Oh, Sprigg.
Darin: (sniffles and coughs) I remember. (softer) I remember. See? It's all up here. So whatever happens, keep me there. All right?
Marisha: I guess I have to start getting used to losing things.
Darin: Yes. Or you can be hidden away in a prison for 37 years. And that's not life, child. That's hiding. Don't hide.
Marisha: I've already built my own prison. They don't know. I'm already there.
Darin: You can break out. You can. It's hard. But you can do it. Just take the first step. And then you take another one. And then you take another one.
Marisha: And I grab his hand, and with that, I cast Plane Shift to wherever he is leading to go.
Matt: All right. The rest of you gathered hands for this?
Laura: I guess so.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Is there enough of us? Trinket, in the necklace. Quick!
Matt: Trinket. (roars) Into the necklace.
Darin: Wait. My invisible frog companion.
Sam: Is he real?
Darin: Yes. (laughter)
Matt: There is a sudden (sucking noise). A shuddering of power energy around you as you feel the vibration out of Sprigg's hand emanate throughout the entire loop you guys have created throughout your grasp. The familiar bright light flashes before you, and you feel your body being pulled through, at incredible speeds, through darkness. There. The familiar racing of the divine gate. (fast travel noise) As you pass through one of its many portholes. Then, adrift. By now you've-- the times you've passed through the gate, you've passed through it a handful of times since now. Adrift. Still holding hands, but the circle's beginning to turn into an oval. You can all glance around and see each other. Did you miss your destination? Did you overshoot? What's next? (whoosh) Another white flash. And suddenly you're at a destination. You glance around and you're standing within a small chamber. It resembles a decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants. It's empty. There are marble pillars stretching to a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all. Silk-draped cloths drift and hang at odd angles throughout the ceiling. Glowing points of magical light latched within iron cages dangle at the edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room. There are walls on each side of this chamber, about 30 or 40 feet from you, and one arched hallway across from you that leads to the only other chamber you've seen.
Marisha: I immediately turn and look to see if Sprigg is still holding my hand.
Matt: Sprigg is still holding your hand.
Laura: See? All that fucking shit was for nothing! He's still alive!
Sam: Are you the same Sprigg as before?
Darin: I hope so. Let's ask my invisible frog companion. Well, I guess we'd better go find what we are looking for.
Marisha: Okay. Glad you're with us, Sprigg.
Darin: It's good to be alive.
Marisha: Yes, it is.
Darin: Remember that.
Marisha: Okay. I will.
Matt: As you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway, you go through the domed arch, and the hallway extends on. Featureless, smooth grey marble. Like a solid punch that seemed to have carved out whatever this material was. It extends for 100 feet. 150 feet. And even though there's very very faint light, and many of you can see through darkvision, there is a darkness about 60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see. You can only see so far beyond that radius, and you're not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from. The air is chilled, but not uncomfortably so. You can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through small spaces. A familiar sound from the many times you've spent underground, through caverns that had some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface. A few steps more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber. Into a library, if you could even call it that. Bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet, before flickering lights fell from your vision. You do not see where they stop. These columns of just tomes and cases and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just be infinite in front of you, to two sides of this road and upward. They seem to stretch in almost every direction, the walls to the side of you. You see columns ahead of you, and they tend to wind and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases, to no end. It's very Escher-esque in how the further up you look, they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other. Your eyes, now attuned to the realms beyond mortality, you catch glimpses of shifting wind gathering books and turning pages. Spirits of the library, though sparse as they may be from this entry point, organizing. Reading and learning from whatever words are within. You begin to almost get vertigo, trying to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous place. An endless sea of stories. Spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the history of Exandria past, present, and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present, currently the future.
Taliesin: I've dreamed of this place.
Liam: Inside Matt's brain?
Taliesin: This is immortality. This is everything. (sighs, chuckles) I may never leave. I glide over to Vex and hold her close. This is stunning. My god, I think they may have actually forgotten all the idiot things I said yesterday.
Laura: Feels pretty good, doesn't it?
Taliesin: I think they've completely forgotten. I'm sorry. May have panicked.
Laura: I give him a kiss.
Taliesin: I'll be right back. I'm going to run towards one of those stacks, like a child.
Matt: Okay. You begin to take the first--
Taliesin: I'm doing a title run. I want to figure out the organizational system before I touch a book.
Matt: There are no words on any of the spines.
Taliesin: I pick one.
Matt: Okay. You pick.
Taliesin: All right. I pick it up. I look around to see if anybody has a problem. And I turn to the title page.
Matt: It's ironic you do this, because the book is in Celestial.
Taliesin: I read Celestial.
Matt: You do. It's ironic that you did that. (chuckles) Glancing through, it appears to be describing a birth. Describing a tunnel, then a light, then a cry.
Taliesin: I skip to the end. Last page.
Matt: It seems to be an older man, surrounded by his family--
Taliesin: I've got it. I put it down. I pick up another one.
Matt: You glance through this book.
Taliesin: First page.
Matt: Begins very similarly to the last one.
Taliesin: Last page.
Matt: This one actually ends with what appears to be a horseback riding accident.
Marisha: Oh god, they're souls.
Taliesin: 115 pages in.
Matt: 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to talk about the sorrow of a lost romance, and trying to deal, coping at a young adult age.
Taliesin: I put it back and I turn. They're made of people.
Laura: Wait, what? It's skin books?
Taliesin: It's people! And I'm going to find the most interesting spine and I'm going to turn to the first. Birth. Death.
Laura: I can't read that, dear.
Taliesin: Birth! Death! Sex. Birth, death, some disappointment. I am just gone. I'm running back and forth, finding whatever interesting spine I can. Are they all in Celestial?
Matt: They are currently. All the ones you've picked up are in Celestial.
Taliesin: Oh my god. Okay. This is great. All right. I'm eventually probably going to pass out from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down.
Laura: We should maybe find Ioun, don't you think?
Taliesin: If we must, yes. Just as an experiment, I'm going to think about Vesper and try and touch a book. I don't expect this to work, but I'm going to close my eyes and think about, and pick it up and flip through it.
Matt: Make a religion check.
Taliesin: Nope.
Matt: You grab a tome and pull it forth, and as you read through the story, it's an unfamiliar one.
Taliesin: There's a system. I will discover the system. I'm going to keep running around like a kid.
Matt: What are the rest of you guys doing while Percival is running around like a kid?
Travis: I'm not interested in the fucking books.
Marisha: Distracted by Percy, Keyleth just scans. Does anything in Primordial stick out?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Marisha: That's good. 29.
Matt: Glancing about, none of the spines have anything written on them, so you have to start pulling a few books out and opening them.
Marisha: I hold my hand over and pull.
Matt: You open it up. It's not in a language you understand.
Marisha: I put it back and get frustrated.
Taliesin: I've stopped. I'm good.
Liam: Watched her the whole time and quietly walk up behind and give her a hug from behind and don't say anything.
Sam: Are there any doors leading forward or back?
Matt: It's a labyrinth of bookshelves. There's a path forward between, two or three ahead of you, but then it comes to an end where it splits off in two directions. Like I said, they travel up infinitely, so you're not quite sure which way leads where.
Laura: Is Sprigg still glowing?
Matt: Sprigg is, actually-- There's a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since your arrival.
Laura: I wonder if we could follow the glow. Warmer?
Marisha: Hey, Sprigg. Stand over there!
Darin: All right. I run to where she's pointing. Is there any change in the glow?
Matt: No noticeable change.
Marisha: Damn. Sprigg, stand over there!
Darin: I just was shot with a bunch of arrows, so give me a second. I run over there, stop halfway and go, ow, and then I continue. When I get there, any change in the glow?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Darin: Oh, it's a one.
Matt: No discernible difference.
Sam: You're inspired, if you want to use inspiration.
Matt: It's a natural one. It's an auto-fail.
Taliesin: Is there a card catalog?
Sam: Is there a central area info desk?
Matt: You can make an investigation check to begin to wander around and try to find your way.
Sam: Oh, that's a natural 20.
Matt: Scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one of the random rows.
Sam: I'm clutching my Ioun stone.
Matt: Okay. All right. Anyone else do anything?
Taliesin: He seems to have purpose. I'm giddily following behind.
Matt: Okay, Percy's following Scanlan.
Laura: I'm going to walk with Percy. Oh, and Trinket's out.
Matt: Okay. Trinket (bear grunt) looks confused and starts looking up.
Laura: I know. I know, dear.
Matt: Falls onto his back.
Sam: Are Vex and Percy walking with me?
Matt: Yes, they are.
Sam: I'm going to whip out my flute and I start going, (wedding march).
Taliesin: Oh. He may have heard.
Laura: He heard?
Taliesin: I thought you were going to die! I may have panicked.
Laura: Wait.
Taliesin: We were asked to plead for your life, and I may have panicked.
Laura: Who did you tell? Percival, who did you tell?
Sam: Look at your shirt.
Laura: What? (screams) No!
Taliesin: I panicked!
Laura: Percy!
Taliesin: I panicked! There was a giant glowing sun, and I may have panicked. Well, I was a bit vague, but I was--
Laura: A bit vague? Scanlan, what did he say?
Sam: Well.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Sam: First comes love. Then comes marriage.
Taliesin: I may have hinted that we might have eloped. May have hinted.
Sam: Wait, you're married?
Taliesin: I may have hinted.
Sam: Wait, no, you said you were betrothed to be married? Wait, you're married? Oh, wow, you just spilled it!
Taliesin: Silence! Cone of Silence!
Sam: They're married!
Matt: You try and yell, and it's making no sound. It is just absolute quiet. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Darin: I run in the corner and see if I glow again.
Liam: Keyleth and Vax heard the (wedding march), so we had a very different silent scene over in our spot.
Marisha: Yeah, Keyleth was quietly sobbing in Vax's arms and then heard (wedding march) and went (angry roar).
Laura: Why is that bad? Why was that angry?
Liam: Because we don't get that.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Grog?
Sam: So you're going to ruin everyone else's joy. You're one of those couples.
Liam: Thank you, vacation Scanlan.
Marisha: Worst double date sangria partners ever.
Taliesin: He's back, ladies and gentlemen. He's back and taking no prisoners.
Sam: Are you guys going on vacation? We got a divorce.
Liam: It's the Debbie Downer SNL sketch.
Matt: Grog, what are you doing?
Travis: I'm as uncomfortable as I can possibly be. This is the worst-case scenario of my entire life. I'm not moving and hoping this is all over soon.
Taliesin: I love that.
Travis: It's just endless books, beyond what you can see! Are there chairs?
Laura: I feel like Pike would've comforted him.
Matt: Yeah, Pike comes over.
Travis: There are chairs?
Matt: No, there aren't. She goes, "Do you want to go with everyone else, Grog?"
Travis: I don't know. Do you?
Matt: "It's okay, yeah! They're walking."
Travis: I want to leave. Fast.
Matt: "The faster we follow them, then the faster we can go."
Travis: Okay. Let's go.
Matt: "I bet you could read some of these books."
Travis: I bet not. These are really tall books.
Matt: "Come on." She grabs your hand and begins tugging you behind her. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: Me and him?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Leaning into each other.
Matt: Okay. So you guys stay there.
Darin: I'm trying to see if I'm glowing anywhere.
Matt: You run around for a good minute and a half and you're not seeing any sort of change.
Darin: Nothing?
Matt: No.
Darin: Can I go forward into the bookcases and look right and left to see where they lead?
Matt: Okay, yeah. You turn around the corner and see them disappear around the edge.
Darin: I'll continue.
Matt: Okay. So you follow them. As you guys are having this silent argument, Sprigg catches up to you, but you hear nothing, Sprigg, as they're all going...
Taliesin: I just turned it off. I got everyone to agree.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Hi. How's it going?
Darin: Glowing. You are, too! What's going on with that? Yeah, you seem to be blushing.
Laura: It's so hot in here. It's very hot in here.
Matt: Pike and Grog catch up around the corner.
Travis: What did you find? The way out? Exit?
Sam: Seems like it could be this way. We'll have to band together and go forward.
Travis: Really?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: Where did you get the sunglasses from?
Sam: It's glowing in here.
Matt: The Ioun stone actually is giving a faint glow similar to the glow that you see emanating from Sprigg's torso.
Sam: Is it glowing any more than--
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Oh, okay. That's an eight. Maybe 11, I don't know. Do I add Jack of All Trades?
Matt: You do, yeah. If you're not--
Sam: I really want to know. I will inspire myself, and I'll add a d12. That makes it 16.
Matt: Okay. You start getting the sense, the further you walk, both your stone and Sprigg are beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow, and so you guys begin to realize that this could be used as a path to something. You're not quite sure.
Sam: Let's keep going.
Matt: Okay. So everyone's going behind.
Liam: Imagination clarification, because a Silence effect went off there. Did Vax and Keyleth hear, "You're married?" Or was that all covered by Silence?
Matt: No, he crushed that in Silence.
Liam: So we heard the song, but that's it. Good to know.
Matt: Everyone else has gone ahead and vanished into the library. You guys are staying?
Liam: Noticing that we're totally alone, silently tug Keyleth down after them.
Taliesin: I felt that honesty was important at that moment.
Laura: No, it very much is. I'm very glad. I'm just surprised he didn't say anything. I spoke with him.
Sam: He was acting nobly. I won't tell anyone if you don't want me to.
Taliesin: We had to tell them eventually.
Matt: As you're following the stone, you hear some footfalls as Vax and Keyleth catch up to you guys.
Marisha: We already know. It's fine.
Liam: You're engaged. You don't have to--
Taliesin: Well.
Laura: I'm sorry I didn't tell you about that. Engagement. But you know.
Marisha: You fucking liars. You fucking liars! Just tell us! We know!
Laura: We got married.
Taliesin: We may have gotten married.
Marisha: Yeah. (sarcastically) Oh, surprise!
Taliesin: It was going to be--
Laura: (weakly) Celebration!
Taliesin: We didn't want to make it a thing. We wanted it to just be--
Sam: I think it's great.
Laura: Thank you, Scanlan.
Sam: It's wonderful when two people can fall in love and have each other forever and ever. That's nice. No, I mean it! You guys are great. You're super cute together. You'll make Whitestone-- You'll be celebrities there.
Travis: Do we have to get you gifts?
Sam: No, they eloped, so we're clear.
Taliesin: Very specifically, no. This place.
Marisha: Yeah, it's amazing. And Keyleth lights up her flame hands as she walks off in a fury.
Taliesin: Do you not know what this place means? Am I the only one who understands what this place means?
Travis: I would love to know.
Taliesin: It all matters!
Laura: None of us have forgotten.
Taliesin: No, I mean, really! It all matters! So much, and it's not going to go away! Nothing goes away!
Marisha: No, it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except for, what, one, maybe two people ever.
Taliesin: One and two people are all that it takes to experience something!
Matt: An echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe. A creaky, warm, matronly voice that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother. It says, "Nothing is forever, Percival." You glance off to the right, and you can see there's a break in the bookcase. To your right, you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular common area within the library, where the ground domes downward into an 80-foot-wide concave pit of cushions and tables, all standing at odd angles alongside this pit, but never sliding. Gravity seems to shift depending on where the dome stands. These tables hold teacups and writing implements and various other décor, and things that involve binding and writing. None of them slipping, all of them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest. Long, spiraling streams of silver, blue, and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight, and they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area. Sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome, no larger than a normal person, is an older woman with long, wavy silver hair. Her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond eyes, but the warmth of her smile, and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately. Her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the pillows like roots. She smiles as you turn and see her. "I felt that you would find me." And that's where we'll end tonight's session.
Sam: Wow, Matt. Wow, Darin!
Liam: Can everybody watching still at home give a round of applause for Darin?
Matt: Seriously. If you're available, you may want to, if you can, come and join us for the first half maybe. Not next week, but the week after Comic Con, if you're interested. Because I want to roleplay out you meeting Ioun.
Darin: It would be an honor. You know how important this is to me.
Matt: Great. I'll look forward to having you back in a couple weeks, then.
Darin: And I will see you next weekend, as well!
Matt: Yes, indeed. Oh, Comic Con. Guys, thank you so much. Great game, well done. Breaking stuff, apparently. Once again, we have no episode next week because we'll be at Comic Con, but we have our panel on Saturday for Critical Role. Love you guys, hope you have a wonderful night, and is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]

Matt: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons and can't listen to a count off screen when we're going to go live. But I appreciate the effort guys.
Liam: Nobody could hear me say, "Scaramucci, I fucked up."
Matt: I did. Don't do that. His life's hard enough right now. All right. Anyway, bringing this back in, thank you for joining us. We'll pick up here in a minute for the actual story, but first we have some quick announcements. No, not Siri. Announcements. Come on. She's all right. First and foremost, tonight's episode is sponsored by our friends at Puzzle Quest. Magic: the Gathering. Samuel, you wanna talk about this?

So typically, when Puzzle Quest is our sponsor I do a little quiz with Taliesin. Today I'm going to throw it to Liam O'Brien, just to mix it up. The theme of tonight's quiz is: Is this a Magic: the Gathering card or a Kama Sutra position? (laughter)
Sam: Black Lotus.
Liam: That is Kama Sutra.
Sam: That is Magic  the Gathering.
Marisha: A classic! That is the world's most famous Magic: the Gathering card!
Sam: Reverse cowgirl.
Liam: Magic  the Gathering.
Matt: Strangely, yeah. White deck.
Sam: She Wolf.
Liam: She Wolf is Magic  the Gathering.
Sam: No, that's--
Liam: God damn it! (laughter)
Sam: Lone Wolf.
Liam: That's Magic  the Gathering. I'm just doing B on every question.
Sam: Illicit Auction.
Liam: That's Magic  the Gathering.
Sam: You're correct! The Angry Pirate.
Liam: That's a Sam Riegel original.
Sam: That's a Kama Sutra. Correct, Liam O'Brien. Maybe two more. Two more. The Curled Angel.
Liam: That's so close to another phrase. Let's call that the Kama Sutra.
Sam: Correct! The Mud Hole.
Liam: (high voice) Magic  the Gathering?
Sam: Correct! (cheering)
Sam: The last one, last one  Excavation.
Liam: Ew!
Sam: It's both. (laughter)
Sam: Marvel Puzzle Quest! No! Magic  the Gathering - Puzzle Quest
Matt: Yay, Puzzle Quest! This time Magic. Well done, Sam. Well done, Liam!
Travis: I was educated.
Matt: All right, moving on. Laura, we had some updates you said as far as merch goes?
Laura: Merchandise!
Travis: She's playing with her giant trash bag of dice.
Laura: I just finished organizing it, you guys. Okay. I wanted to give you guys some updates on some merch items. Those amazing posters? They will be sent out in a week. I think. Yes. They will be sent out in a week, because they're in the warehouse now, ready to get shipped. I've gotten a lot of messages asking where are the aprons? And the reason that they're not shipped yet is because we ended up selling so many that the manufacturer didn't have enough cloth to make the aprons, so then there was a backlog of that. So they're done, and they're about to get to the warehouse so you'll be getting your aprons in a couple weeks, and then we'll start getting them, so that's solid. Also, we have these awesome necklaces. Also, some other stuff.
Sam: Nice and vague.
Matt: Things are there. (laughs) Thank you, Laura. Let's see, next up. GenCon live. We are at the tail end of any available tickets for the show. So if you haven't got one yet and you're still planning to be around or near Indianapolis for GenCon and want to come see, get it quickly. We're about to close that out. Looking forward to seeing everyone there who's coming, it's going to be fun and depending on the next couple episodes, I'm real curious to where it ends up when we get to GenCon.
Laura: So it's going to be a canon episode?
Matt: Oh, it's a canon episode. It's going to be the next episode.
Laura: What if we all die at the live show?
Sam: If one of us dies tonight, do we not go to GenCon?
Travis: Yeah, pretty much.
Matt: Well, we'll put you in the front row. (groaning)
Travis: If you die, we will lower you from above like an angel on a fly reel.
Matt: On the Peter Pan wire setup?
Travis: With some asshole swinging you from side to side.
Matt: Just sending you across the audience.
Travis: (yelling) I want to get down, I can't feel my legs!
Matt: Make an acrobatics check!
Liam: It's going to be so fucking great.
Matt: So yes. Look forward to that.
Laura: I like how we all assumed it was going to be Sam that was dead and flying above the audience.
Matt: All right. So also, the Critical Role podcast. We have up to episode 30 now available. Next batch went up, so those of you who are coming on the podcast audio version of our crazy story, those episodes 21 to 30 are available for you now. Talks Machina, once again on Tuesdays. We'll have a discussion about this episode next week and on Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, with our wonderful host Brian Foster on Twitch and Alpha.
Liam: Is next week the one that they're off, though?
Matt: Are they off next week?
Liam: I think they're taking a week off, no? The week after?
Marisha: Both? Both. The week after Gencon we will be streaming the panel that we did at GenCon. I feel like Brian is going to be in New York for Ashley's birthday right now. He flew out today.
Matt: So not next Tuesday, but the Tuesday after.
Laura: Wait, no! I thought he'll be back by then. No?
Liam: He'll chime in on Twitter.
Matt: Follow Talks Machina on Twitter for updates about what's happening next episode.
Travis: We planned this out way in advance.
Matt: Last couple things  Sagas of Sundry. The final episode of Dread is now up on Alpha, and we'll see the finale of that crazy, crazy ride.
Travis: It's so good. It's scurry.
Marisha: We've got our first Sagas of Sundry tattoo! It's beautiful and gorgeous. I love it. It's amazing.
Travis: I watch the show with the lights on 'cause it creeps me out.
Matt: Good. We didn't have that option. And also the new episode of CelebriDND is up as well, where I got to dungeon master wonderful John Bradley who you may know as Sam Tarley on Game of Thrones. Also, had a wonderful guest Laura and Liam joined us for that. It was a lot of fun, so check it out. I believe our last announcement today is the birthday of one fabulous goliath barbarian.
Travis: Once a year, y'all. Once a year.
Matt: Travis Willingham, happy birthday, buddy.
Laura: Happy birthday, bb!
Travis: I can't die today, right?
Sam: Where's the cake?
Travis: It's in my stomach.
Laura: There's no cake, y'all.
Sam: But where's the cake?
Travis: I mean, that was awesome.
Marisha: I have a little cake eraser. Do you want the cake eraser for the game? Hang on. Where is it? Where did I put it? Happy birthday!
Travis: It's a little Pike cake!
Matt: And on that, enjoy your cake. And let's bring us into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: And welcome back.
Travis: We didn't say anything.
Matt: No, you didn't. I was waiting and there was absolute silence. Wow. This is what it's like to have respect. (laughter)
Marisha: 107 episodes later.
Matt: That's all it took. And it's the last time it'll ever happen.
Liam: Lulling you into a false sense of security.
Matt: So, anyway, last we left off, Vox Machina, in facing the terrible threat of Vecna returned to physical form, sent you all through this conflict to seek audiences with a number of the deities of Exandria. After getting blessings and fragments of the essence of three of the gods, you discovered that Vecna had completed the Ritual of Seeding and ascended into godhood. However, discussing with Ioun, the Knowing Mistress, it will take a little bit of time for him to both understand the extent of his power, to claim his domains, and expand beyond his current condensed avatar form, so time is of the essence. Not to mention that in order to claim the full strength, there needs to be a showing of power and faith to gather attention and faith from the masses. So with that information, you also imbued upon Grog the ability to blacksmith and Percival the knowledge of the construct of these Divine Trammels, things that could possibly be used to seal and have been used previously to seal a god as killing them is a very difficult and dangerous thing. Retrieving this information, you discovered that the place where these can be crafted is called the Core Anvil. Once belonging to the All-Father, the deity of construction, design and craftsmanship, it resides beneath an underwater volcano known as Scaldseat, off the shore of a city called Shorecomb in Issylra. You also had a fantastic little run-in with Vecna, recently, taunting you all. Last we left off, you had found yourself in Vasselheim, went to the Trial Forge to speak with Earthbreaker Groon, discovered what would be required to attempt to make contact with Kord, and you made communion with the Raven Queen, and in declaring your complete faith in her she offered a piece of her essence to give you the third seed with which to make a third Divine Trammel, and with you all falling asleep within Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion, you cast True Polymorph on yourself to take the form of a planetar and did whatever you did in that form as you all went to sleep that evening.
Liam: Except that while he was checking out his junk in the mirror-- heavenly junk-- I shut the door behind Keyleth and I. I don't think we should go another couple of days in silence.
Marisha: Has it been days?
Liam: Just barely.
Marisha: Feels like an eternity.
Liam: I know that you are angry, and I am just-- I'm sorry.
Marisha: I was angry. I was very angry, and maybe if we had this conversation yesterday, even, I might be yelling that to your face right now. But it's hard to be angry at bravery and selflessness. I mean, we've always had the problem of you having one too many ladies in your life, right? (laughs) It's hard to compete with a god.
Liam: I've done a lot of stupid things in my life, and I've never had any regrets, really. I do know the chance you took on me, and I've confirmed your worst fears, and then some.
Marisha: It's not your fault.
Liam: Regardless, I am sorry, and I regret that I'm not outright dead already and that you have to stare at this walking pantomime of a life in front of you, but Kiki, I'm grateful for the time I have left to look on you, and I am grateful to fight for your future. And I'm grateful for that chance you took on me.
Marisha: I wouldn't take it back. You taught me how to take chances. (laughs) Can I ask you a question? What exactly was the deal that you made with the Raven Queen? Was it when we slew Vecna, or defeated him? I have a feeling semantics are becoming increasingly more important.
Liam: She offered me a way back, and it was the only way back. I wasn't coming back, not after that. Not without her blessing.
Marisha: Even if we found a way, you wouldn't take it. To reverse the deal. I'm not asking. I'm just confirming.
Liam: I don't want to leave, but there are some things that I will not test. Hey. I do have faith in her. And I have faith in you and what you'll do. (sighs) God, I feel so stupid.
Marisha: It's fitting, really. You can protect that plane. I'll be here to protect this one. I mean, if these past few days have taught us anything, it's death isn't the end. I just don't want to forget. If Sprigg could forget the names of his party members that he died alongside-- he ran-- never mind. What's going to happen in a hundred or hundreds or even a thousand years? I don't want to forget this. What if there comes a day when I don't even recognize the name Vox Machina anymore?
Liam: I don't believe that will happen. You're going to live a long life. Yes. And you will love again. And you will lead. And you will be loved, because who cannot love you?
Marisha: I can name a few.
Liam: No one of any worth.
Marisha: I'm grateful for you, and I always will be. And I'm grateful for any second that we have left. And I don't want to spend any more being angry at you. And I'm sorry that I was.
Liam: You don't want me to go?
Marisha: (laughs) Of course not.
Liam: Hey, I'm fucking cold. Will you give me a hug?
Marisha: Yeah. It's the weirdest thing, by the way, you being cold. I mean, it's just something to get used to.
Liam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: I don't have any clever closer. I'm just going to crawl into bed and go to sleep.
Matt: Okay. Both of you curl up and fall asleep. The morning comes. You all come to consciousness within Scanlan's Magnificent Mansion. And find breakfast of various grains and oats and quinoa.
Taliesin: Lentils.
Travis: What do you mean lentils? What is that? What is a lentil? Is it a leaf? Is it a bean?
Taliesin: No one really knows, to be fair.
Travis: Why on god's green earth is it even here? I don't understand.
Taliesin: Lentils are here to punish us.
Travis: Really?
Taliesin: Yes. We have done something terribly wrong, and now we must eat of these.
Travis: That makes sense an hour from now when I get punished in the loo.
Taliesin: We are punished by that.
Marisha: I'm sorry. This head cold mixed with crying is bad.
Laura: It gets you, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's rough.
Laura: Yeah, that's what happened to me that day.
Marisha: It's the worst!
Sam: Well, your voice is super sexy tonight, so that's good.
Laura: (raspy singing) Smelly cat, smelly cat--
Marisha: (raspy singing) What are they feeding you?
Matt: All right, so as you finish your meals in the morning, prepare yourself for the actions of the coming day, what do you wish to do?
Laura: I don't fucking know.
Sam: Are we going to this volcano under the water?
Laura: Yeah, right? That's where we have to go.
Sam: We need to be able to swim.
Taliesin: And we need to be immune to poison.
Laura: Yes, so if we have a Heroes' Feast, that will take care of one thing. And I have two chalices because we never used the one.
Sam: We should save at least one for a certain fight.
Laura: Yes, obviously.
Travis: You can make us breathe underwater, right?
Marisha: Yes, I can.
Laura: All of us? Even Trinket?
Marisha: (unsure) Yes?
Laura: And Pike?
Matt: Well Pike, goes up-- yes, don't forget! "I can prepare the feast for you guys. That way, you don't have to spend a spell of yours for it. As you guys are on this mission to go make this-- I can be help-- I think I need to stay here for now to shepherd both the people in my temple of the Everlight with whatever words I can keep them calm under this chaos in the city."
Laura: Oh no! Pike, but what if Vasselheim is attacked?
Matt: "Then I can let you know. I also have a Sending spell prepared, so if anything happens, I can let you know immediately. As long as you're on this plane."
Sam: It's so convenient!
Matt: "That's what clerics are here for!" She punches you in the shoulder.
Travis: Can I have something of yours, at least until we see each other again? (sounds of distress)
Matt: "Of course, Grog!" And she comes up to you and, "Let me see your axe real fast."
Travis: Ooh, the Bloodaxe?
Matt: "Yeah!"
Travis: There you go! Mary Poppins handbag.
Matt: She hefts it and takes a little bit of her fading blue hair at the tip and carves off a little piece of it, hands the axe back to you, and very deftly braids it into a small braid, ties it off, and hands it to you.
Travis: (gasps) It's the sweetest thing ever.
Matt: "No, but seriously don't eat it, please."
Laura: That's really creepy.
Matt: "Grog! No! No."
Travis: I tie it onto my necklace.
Matt: Okay. "Please be safe. And if anything happens, I'm going to let you know as soon as possible."
Liam: Oh man, it's going to hurt not to have you with us, though. Oh, well.
Matt: "You guys will be fine. Better we save our strength for whatever's out there."
Travis: Yeah, and if Vasselheim is attacked, you don't go saving the city all by yourself.
Laura: Seriously.
Travis: I know what you're like.
Matt: "Why would I steal the fun from you?"
Travis: That's what I thought.
Matt: "Okay!"
Travis: All right. Bye, Pike.
Laura: Wait no, she has to prepare the Heroes' Feast for us before we say goodbye.
Travis: Hi, Pike!
Matt: You hand her the chalice, and she prepares the feast within the mansion, so what little bit of for some of you may have been an unsatisfying breakfast this morning is quickly taken over by the fantastically tasting feast of such a holy spread. Taking the hour to eat it, all of you guys get the benefits of Heroes' Feast.
Travis: No lentils, right?
Matt: There is a bowl of lentils for those who may want it.
Sam: I had some. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so as the Heroes' Feast says here--
Laura: Immune to fear and poison and advantage on wisdom checks.
Marisha: And you roll 2d10 extra.
Taliesin: Wisdom saving throws.
Matt: I'm going to roll 2d10 for you guys.
Laura: Do you guys want food now, or do you want to wait until the break?
Travis: Let's wait until the break.
Matt: Let's wait until the break.
Taliesin: We'll take a slightly early break in the long run.
Matt: Whoa! Two nines! (cheering)
Matt: That's lucky. Okay, so there you go. That's 18 additional hit points.
Laura: That can regenerate?
Matt: Yes. That's the maximum of your hit points for the next 24 hours, so keep that in mind, folks.
Marisha: Yeah, dope!
Laura: How long do your inspiring speeches last?
Marisha: Oh, that is an excellent question. How long do my speeches--
Sam: Said Kathleen Turner.
Liam: Said Harvey Fierstein. (laughter)
Marisha: Said Katharine Hepburn.
Matt: Inspiring Leader. A creature can't gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it has finished a short or long rest. So you have temporary hit points until your next long rest, essentially.
Marisha: Okay. So can I double up on that?
Liam: Give us more hit points?
Matt: You can. It'll be temporary hit points on top of that, yes.
Marisha: Oh. Yeah.
Sam: We're probably not going to fight anything, though.
Marisha: Since my voice is completely shot, and I don't want to do a speech.
Travis: Yeah, but we need it.
Marisha: I am going to do--
Marisha: An interpretive dance! (laughter)
Sam: An interpretive dance! (laughter)
Marisha: Of us swimming through the volcano, and then going underground and shielding ourselves, and then fighting! And then Grog's forging the trammels! (enthusiastic a cappella music)
Travis: Holy shit.
Liam: Still shouted narration through it all. (laughter)
Matt: Wow, that happened.
Taliesin: I'm amazed that took over a hundred episodes. I've been waiting for the interpretive dance for a long time.
Laura: Yay, how many did we get from that?
Matt: So everyone gets 18 temporary hit points, right?
Taliesin: Is that max goes up 18?
Matt: No, temporary hit points, so as soon as you take damage, they go away from the temporary first. Temporary never come back. Then you have the maximum hit point bonus.
Taliesin: So 18 max up and then an 18 on top of that that goes away once you get hit.
Liam: But do I get sneak attack damage, or is it also a critical hit?
Matt: Raven Queen taketh away. All right, so as you guys are all sitting there watching Keyleth dance while she eats, while you're eating, it's a unique display. You're prepared for the rest of your day, Pike says goodbye to everybody, gives you a hug. Says, "Be safe."
Sam: Pike, will you do me a favor, and will you get word to Kaylie somehow?
Matt: "I can do that, yeah."
Sam: Tell her Dad's okay and saving the world again.
Matt: She goes, "...Done!"
Marisha: Hey, Pike?
Sam: I should have asked that long ago!
Matt: "Probably, yeah!"
Marisha: Could you also do one of those to Tary?
Matt: "Right!"
Sam: Well, don't say, "Dad's okay, saving the world again." That won't make any sense to him.
Marisha: Tell him we're all alive.
Laura: Tell him we love him, and that we're okay for the time being.
Sam: Especially Scanlan. He's probably really concerned.
Matt: (laughs) You see this secondary dull flash and release of energy at her fingertips as she finishes the glyph.
Taliesin: Are we doing this now?
Matt: There we go, we have food now!
Laura: We're doing it live! Can I have one slice of breakfast pizza?
Sam: What is this, a restaurant?
Travis: Jesus, what the fuck?
Laura: He's like  hold on.
Liam: Pelor, can I have one slice of breakfast pizza, please? (laughter)
Marisha: This marker sucks balls!
Matt: So Pike makes her way toward her temple. You guys are still within Scanlan's mansion, what are you doing?
Laura: Okay, I guess we should exit the mansion. And then--
Sam: How are we traveling? And where are we going?
Travis: Do we Plane Shift?
Laura: Above the water, over to the volcano. How do we do this?
Marisha: It's a bit away from Vasselheim, if I remember. I did see a tree, right, that was near the town?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: So yeah.
Laura: Okay, so once we're there, do we know exactly what we're doing?
Sam: We're diving down into the volcano, forging some trammels.
Laura: And the volcano's underwater. Is that what the schtick is with it?
Matt: Yes. It's on the floor, and you can notice it because across this open clear ocean, there is one column of black smoke that emits from the waves.
Laura: So it's an active volcano that we're diving into?
Taliesin: Underwater.
Laura: Solid.
Matt: Essentially.
Sam: One question. I have the infinite blessings of Ioun's knowledge. I am a holy man. However, I'm not exactly clear. Do we need those little peas to make these trammels? And we have three of them. We're not going to get more of these before we forge the trams?
Laura: I don't think there's time.
Travis: Remember, Delilah was already down there? She was in tunnels underground, right?
Laura: Somewhere. We don't know where, exactly.
Travis: We don't know if she's at this forge?
Laura: No, we don't know if she's there, we don't know if she's with Vecna.
Matt: The vision that you had, she was topside, and there was snow.
Marisha: Yeah, she was coming out of Thar Amphala.
Matt: Well, tunnels that burrowed beneath the city of Thar Amphala.
Marisha: And she was coming out. She had both of her eyeballs back, and was like, "Ooh, it's chilly." Bitch! Enjoying the winter snow.
Liam: Two regular eyes?
Marisha: Two regular eyes! Why do you think she keeps coming back? (gasps) Oh no.
Travis: What?
Laura: What?
Liam: What?
Taliesin: You're nervous about everything, is that what we've come to?
Marisha: I don't know, maybe she made a deal similar to the deals we've made, but with Vecna.
Taliesin: I would assume so.
Marisha: I mean, if gods can give us their blessing, why can't she have one?
Sam: We should really tip 10%.
Laura: I know, at least!
Sam: You know, be really generous.
Laura: Look at this! You guys!
Travis: So we go. Right? Do we go to the shore and then out into the ocean on a ship?
Laura: We go to the shore, then we climb up the volcano, then we dive into the volcano?
Travis: The volcano is underneath the ocean.
Laura: But there's smoke coming out of it!
Travis: Underneath the ocean.
Marisha: Yeah. A trail of black, sooty, bubbly goodness.
Travis: We've only talked about it for four hours; it's okay.
Laura: I thought maybe the top was coming out of the water.
Matt: No, it's at the bottom of the ocean. There are volcanoes underwater, and this one is less burning smoke. It's the sulfuric gases and poisonous fumes of the various reactions and chemicals and pressure beneath.
Travis: You never watched behind the scenes on Titanic?
Laura: I got it.
Sam: How do we get there?
Travis: We go to the shore.
Marisha: Well, I have a tree. I can get us there.
Sam: Okay. Let's do it.
Matt: So. With your things gathered, you all find your way, I imagine it's not too far of a walk from the Raven's Crest to a tree that is functional for this spell. It's on the southern border of the quarter that holds the Birthheart, the orchards and various trees there. You find yourselves a suitable tree, gather yourselves, steel yourselves. Now that the morning has come, the tension in the air of Vasselheim and the word that spreads of some sort of looming threat, though sourceless and directionless, definitely has built this air of fear and rush for preparation that surrounds you.
Travis: I have a question, sorry.
Matt: Yes?
Travis: Did Pike come with us to send us off?
Matt: I'll say sure! She walks you guys to the tree.
Travis: Pike? You know you have-- what's it called you put on me one time? That Death Ward? Should we put that on one of us before we go, just in case it's super dangerous? One of the squishier ones? Does someone want Death Ward, so if you go down--
Sam: Put it on Vax.
Travis: Yeah, no.
Laura: I think either Percy or I.
Liam: Pass.
Laura: You.
Taliesin: You.
Sam: Oh god, just kiss already!
Taliesin: We do.
Sam: Oh god! They do.
Travis: Boulder-Parchment-Shears. Perfect opportunity.
Taliesin: Flip for it. Heads or tails?
Marisha: Boulder-Parchment-Shears.
Travis: Yeah, come on.
Taliesin: Boulder-Parchment-Shears?
Travis: One time. One, two, three, go!
Marisha: Oh!
Laura: You.
Sam: Boulder always wins.
Matt: "I can give it to a few people." (laughter)
Laura: Thanks, Pike! That's convenient.
Matt: "That's going to tap out my spells there. I'm going to have to save some for Sending, just in case."
Laura: Yes, of course.
Travis: Those two.
Sam: Mr. and Mrs. de Rolo.
Matt: "Okay, this'll only last for eight hours, so travel quickly."
Taliesin: It's Mr. and Mrs. Vex, let's be fair.
Travis: Thanks, Pike. I thought it might help. Just in case.
Matt: "You, too?"
Travis: Nope! Nope. I like a little danger in my life.
Laura: Is this going to be like the kraken fight? Are we going to be underwater fighting again?
Marisha: I hope not.
Laura: You weren't there. We almost fucking died because you weren't there with us, Scanlan. I hated you at that moment.
Liam: Water under the bridge. Water under the kraken. We're on brighter horizons
Matt: As you guys are arguing, she leans forward and beneath her breath finishes the incantation with the Death Ward, and you, Vex'ahlia, it sounds like a soft clinging of gentle metals in the back of your head, and as it hits this warmth hits your chest and then it sets in. It doesn't quite fade, it's like having a localized blanket held to your sternum. Who else would like one?
Marisha: How many does she get?
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of this, she can muster four.
Laura: Scanlan.
Liam: (raspy voice) How many does she get?
Marisha: (mafia-style voice) How many you got?
Travis: Do you want one?
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: If you die, I'm going to be really upset.
Travis: On my birthday? Come on! What are the chances?
Marisha: He's got that whole barbarian "knock me down, I get back up again" thing.
Laura: I get the fuck back up again! You're Hercules Mulligan!
Marisha: That's why he would be a rogue/barbarian, I think!
Matt: So for those four that have marked it, you have Death Ward, which lasts for eight hours. The first time you drop to zero hit points, it brings you to one, and then the spell fades. All right. Pike sends you off with a wave and you all step through the tree. You feel the transitional burst of energy as the druidic magics pull you from one living source to another, and you all emerge on the outside of a tree that is barely wide enough to sustain the doorway between the two, and as you all gather on the outskirts, you turn around and you can see this somewhat-leafless, living through the winter, but not the prettiest tree you've seen. The doorway portal closes behind you. Glancing around you, there is a light snowfall and you can see slush and snow gathered, dirty, along the edges of the streets. You are on the outskirts of the city of Shorecomb. Population-wise, it can't be more than a few thousand people at most. It looks like there's a very healthy fish trade. To the immediate right of you, there's a cliffside, maybe 200 feet from the edge of the town where there are carts going to and from. You can the large crane carrying large containers and large nets filled with caught fish from the bottom of the cliffside. People around noticed you emerge from a tree, and you can see about four or five of the various peasants and working folk stop in their tracks and stare at you, frozen.
Liam: I know, weird, right? Really weird.
Marisha: Hi!
Matt: "This way, James." And he grabs his little kid's hand and the kid is slack-jawed watching you as he drags him off to the side. People start walking again and still glancing over their shoulder, they go about their business, keeping a very close eye.
Marisha: Maybe I should have found a tree less in the center of things.
Taliesin: I'd rather be here.
Matt: It's not the center of town, thankfully. Still off to the side, but you did catch the eye of a few folk.
Liam: I mean, you still transported us a long way. That's commendable.
Taliesin: How would one go about finding out if you're being watched via magical means? Is there a way to do that other than if one is not a magic user? Is that a perception check?
Matt: No, there are actual spells designed for that.
Laura: Are there spells designed to mask you?
Marisha: Yeah. I don't think any of us have them.
Sam: To mask you from scrying?
Laura: Yeah, so people can't see us. Do you know of anything like that, Scanlan?
Sam: I've heard of such things, but I don't currently have one.
Travis: Cool.
Taliesin: Just curious.
Travis: Good question.
Laura: Yeah, because Vecna's fucking watching us.
Travis: Right now?!
Laura: Yeah, all the fucking time.
Travis: You're sure?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, right over there.
Travis: Do we take a boat now? Or do we find some dolphins and ride out majestically?
Laura: Are we on the water?
Marisha: Can we make our way to the shoreline?
Matt: Okay, it's a couple hundred feet to get to the edge of the cliff. And these are sheer cliffs that drop off for 150, 200 feet or so before it hits very hard pebbled beaches. These aren't sandy beaches.
Marisha: I stop everybody, saying, be careful. It looks like it could be a thousand feet, which is deceiving.
Travis: You know, you're only talking to yourself. We all know.
Marisha: A thousand feet is so long.
Liam: So we're on cliffs facing the ocean, right now?
Matt: Yes, you guys are at the edge of the cliff. You look down, and there are the rocky beaches, there are a number of large docks that jut out from the rocky beach, and you can see there are about five or six varying degrees of rickety winding wooden staircases that are built into the cliffside that lead from the top edge of the cliff down to the beach below. You can see a lot of workers are currently hauling large sacks, small crates and boxes, things that are too small to bring on the large winding cranes that they have on the edge as well. There are ships coming, there are ships going. It looks like this is a decent trade stop for cities along the shoreside here in Issylra.
Laura: What do our elven eyes see? Can we see the smoke?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: That was a Legolas reference, in case you were wondering.
Liam: I'm not familiar with that reference.
Laura: A perception check?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20. Glancing out at this distance, the sky itself is very cloudy, very gray. It's a very gray day. It's cold, it's chilly, the wind that's blowing is very faint, but it's enough to the point where snow is falling. There is a very faint mist in the distance. Either a storm is coming or a storm has passed that's preventing you from seeing any sign of a glimmer of the smoke. So you're not entirely certain the direction.
Marisha: Can I tell if the storm is coming or the storm has passed?
Matt: Make a nature check.
Liam: And there are people about?
Matt: There are people about and some of them are just passing, not paying mind, and few of them stop and glance at these very well-dressed, very dangerous-looking figures that have now just walked up and look out past the ocean, but no one's broaching any conversation. They look like they're more making a wide berth or keeping a very untrusting eye on you as they walk past.
Liam: Druid's doing interpretive dance again.
Matt: So what did you get?
Marisha: I'm a motherfucking human barometer!
Matt: What did you roll?
Travis: Natural 20.
Marisha: Natural 20.
Matt: Oh shit! Okay.
Marisha: Yeah. I'm really good at the check.
Matt: You get the sense that a lot of the snow that was in the street when you got there and the slush was from a storm that recently passed. And the clouds and the fog that you see in the distance, it looks like it's blowing away.
Liam: You there, little girl.
Matt: Okay. (laughing) Strangely, no little girl is working at this dock. However, the person you did see that looked like a little girl is actually a generally short fellow who has a wrap over the top of his head, a swollen cheek where it looks like he might have some sort of a tooth infection who spins around. It's not a bonnet. It's a crusty looking fisherman, who is like, "Who are you calling a little girl?"
Liam: Oh, my bad, fellow! Sorry, as you can tell, we're not from around here. Visiting. Yeah, I had a couple of questions. One, there's a volcano just off this coast somewhere, right?
Matt: "Aye."
Liam: Do you know where it is? Could you point to it?
Taliesin: Was that affirmative or surprise?
Matt: Points out to the ocean.
Laura: Is he pointing in a general direction? I look where he's pointing. Can I see anything?
Matt: No.
Laura: Damn it.
Liam: Are there boats for rent, for hire?
Matt: "Maybe? Yes? I mean--"
Liam: All right, thank you, I think that's all I needed from you, okay.
Laura: I pull out a piece of gold. Do you know where the volcano is?
Matt: "Yes. What, do you think I'm a dog? What is this kind of treatment?"
Laura: Do you want to make some gold?
Matt: "Yes! I'd love to make some gold!"
Laura: Then can you tell me where the fucking volcano is?
Matt: "There we go, straight questions." He rubs his swollen cheek side. You can see his teeth are graying and yellow. There's a little bit of blackened decay at the edges, but he grins a little bit at the sight of the gold. "I need a little more than that paltry sum."
Laura: Paltry sum? How much gold do you see every day? I pull out another piece. Is this enough?
Matt: "Make it five, and I'll introduce you to my docksmen."
Laura: All I want to know is where the volcano is.
Matt: "But you're not looking for a ship to rent, right? Like he said?"
Laura: No.
Matt: "All right. (sniffles) Volcano is that way." And he points out. You see he glances over, he lines up where you can see a couple of larger rocks that are breaking out from the shore surface maybe 20 or 30 feet out from where the pebble beach ends and meets the water line. He's lining up his arm and, "That way, about five miles."
Marisha: Five miles.
Travis: Hey, use your elven eyes, see if you can see it.
Laura: Yeah, I'm going to look real hard. We're a thousand feet up.
Matt: Still, it's too hard to see right now.
Laura: Can't we spell ourselves out there?
Marisha: Well.
Taliesin: We might want that later.
Marisha: I mean, we could. We can.
Laura: We should rent a ship.
Taliesin: If we get a ship, then when it's all over, we have a way out.
Travis: Otherwise, we're walking five miles underwater.
Marisha: I would rather save my 8th-level Animal Shapes in case we need to bail.
Laura: All right, here's three more gold. How about that introduction?
Matt: "That I can muster." Puts the coins in a little pouch in the side and buttons it up and locks it. "All right. Follow me."
Sam: What's your name, young lady?
Matt: "Fenna."
Sam: Fenna. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Matt: "You as well, lass."
Marisha: I love Fenna in my salads.
Matt: Leads you guys back down one of the winding stairways, and you have to wait at certain moments. There are certain areas where it switchbacks, and it's open. You would think it's a platform for looking out, but it's more for letting people get past, and for the pathways up and down, it gets narrow on the actual stairs. But eventually, you make your way down to where these docks are, and there are three large buildings that are the hubs of most people checking in, checking out. They have a number of docksmen that are keeping tabs on what's going in and out of the dock, and what materials are being shipped in, taxing those that are using it temporarily, general business in the vicinity. He leads you over. "Now then, I'm going to introduce you to Senth. She can rent you something, at the very least. I recommend not letting that one in. She has a thing against the smaller folk."
Liam: Oh shit.
Sam: Oh. I'm being racisted against?
Matt: "Look, I'm not-- You seem like a very fine lady."
Sam: Touché, Fenna. Touché.
Matt: "But I know Senth well, and if you want to make a good impression, maybe keep her outside."
Laura: You're not the tallest yourself, you know.
Matt: Stretches his lower back with a couple of cracks and snaps. The hunched man gets about four, five inches of height and is almost cresting about Vax height.
Travis: Look, Scanlan. The necklace is really nice on the inside. I can vouch for it.
Sam: I'm not going into the necklace.
Travis: Why not? New experiences, right? Whatever it takes to achieve the mission.
Laura: Fuck it! Fuck it, I'm not disguising him because of what he looks like! Fuck that.
Sam: Are you standing up for me?
Laura: Of course I am!
Marisha: I would like to argue, he just disguised himself for a solid year.
Laura: I don't care. That was a different reason, and if your fucking dock mistress is such a bitch that she won't give us a good deal because of him then we'll find someone else.
Matt: Fair enough. I would also recommend you lower your voice. We're right outside of her door.
Marisha: Wait, what's her name?
Matt: Senth.
Marisha: Senth.
Sam: It's really easy. I don't mind putting on the hat.
Marisha: It is the principle, but do we have time for principles?
Taliesin: We have time for principles immediately afterwards, when we come back.
Liam: We never have before. Why start now?
Laura: I mean, it's up to you, but I don't think you should do it.
Sam: No, let's stand on principle.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Matt: "Are we done here?"
Taliesin: Oh, you're still here.
Matt: "Good day."
Travis: Thanks for your time.
Matt: Hobbles off and makes his way back up the stairs. So you come outside to this one dock hub. It's a modest two-story building looks like it has like a watch tower second story and the bottom floor is much larger. The door is currently closed. The wood looks a little sea-rotted. You can see the edges of the wood are curling and dark and perpetually damp. Little bits of green moss and various fungus are starting to gather at the very edges of the building, but it seems to be standing and has been there for a while.
Taliesin: (knocking sound)
Matt: You knock on the door. A voice inside goes "Come in."
Taliesin: (door creak) I don't know why I made the sound effect.
Matt: That's okay. As you push the door open, glancing inside, there's general gray dull daylight coming from the cloudy sky, but there are also a few oil lanterns hanging in different places. You can see stacks of maps or other heavy pieces of parchment that are curled up and tied off in sections. There are small crates, most of them empty, that are scattered about the entranceway here, and as you enter the building you watch as a very tall, thin, lanky female half-orc spins around across the room with a singular monocle that is very, very intense to make one eye look really big over the other. Spins around; sides of the head shaved and the rest of it slicked back against the head with a little bit of a light brown shock against the black to one side. Dressed fairly nice but you can see the clothing at an immediate glance is nice upfront and then tatters at the bottom. Spins around. "Yes?"
Taliesin: We were hoping to charter a ship at great expedience to about five miles off the coast to the plume of smoke and the underwater volcano.
Matt: You watch as the one eye, moving independently of the other, glances and looks each of you very quickly up and down and then slicks back into place. "That can be arranged, yes."
Taliesin: Excellent.
Matt: "How long would you wish to charter this ship?"
Travis: Three days?
Laura: Sure, yeah, probably be less than that but three days, sure.
Matt: Do you have a crew?
Taliesin: No, we would need to--
Sam: Can any of us sail?
Travis: Not if we want to live.
Taliesin: We would like to charter a crew also to maintain. We're going to be doing a bit of underwater search and rescue, so.
Matt: "Very well then."
Sam: Will that be possible?
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: Great. Wonderful.
Matt: "Three days' rental including a crew on board. That'll run you approximately 150 gold pieces. I require, to be in case you lose the ship or don't return with it, an additional 500 to hold in case you lose the ship. So a grand total of 650 up front with 500 to be returned upon your return."
Laura: Of course, and you have something to sign. I'm sure Percival can draw something up.
Matt: "Oh, but of course. I would not dream of allowing such a thing without a paper trail."
Taliesin: That will do.
Matt: "Follow me." A quick contract is drawn up. You take a glance over it, Percival. Seems very thorough but nothing beyond what was requested and basically if the ship is not returned all money is forfeit. When the ship is returned, a very intense investigation and perceived state of the ship is going to be requested from an appraiser to see if any damage was taken. Yeah, it's essentially like one of those seedy car rental places that the contract says they will ding you for every damage.
Laura: How much do ships normally cost?
Taliesin: I don't know.
Laura: 600 is very low.
Sam: I feel like we've rented a ship before.
Laura: But it was far less than this.
Taliesin: It was far less than this, but at this point I'm saying let's blow the money.
Laura: Yes, of course. I agree, but an entire ship I feel like would be more than 600.
Travis: We priced it out once before, and it was like 30,000.
Laura: Yeah, so she's giving us a really good deal.
Sam: Maybe it's a shitty ship.
Marisha: I mean, that's fine. I'd prefer a shitty ship if it's cheaper.
Matt: Slaps the contract down in front. "Have we a deal?"
Taliesin: I don't mind.
Matt: "Very well."
Sam: Would you take this as a deposit? I give her this platinum bracelet with a sapphire that I have. We'll get it back when we return the ship. Oh, wait.
Laura: Maybe you should amend that in the contract.
Matt: The one eye is still looking at you. The other is (buzzing) in front of the bracelet. "I find this acceptable in our agreement."
Sam: But wait, it just occurred to me as I was handing that over, we need platinum, don't we? That was platinum, wasn't it?
Laura: Yeah.
Sam: Maybe we'll just do gold instead. Sorry, can I have that back? Sorry.
Liam: Smooth operator. (laughter)
Matt: Flings it back and there is an expression of, "Of course a gnome would do that." If this was a Telltale game it would say, "Her hatred for gnomes deepens."
Laura: That's fine. (bling)
Matt: "All right." Immediately puts it into a small shelf, writes down some remarks on it. "Very well, I will show you to the Shore Shanty. Follow me, please."
Laura: Oh, it sounds elegant.
Travis: Shanty's a fancy name for a mansion, right?
Matt: Leads you out to one of the far end docks, and there are a number of decent ships and larger fishing ships, some faster-travel ships, some long boats. You see one galleon-sized ship that's just left and taken away, and on the far end there is one of the shittiest tugboat-sized boats you've seen in a while. Scanlan, you've seen boats like this and they're largely used for either relatively cheap and relatively quick messenger services. A courier ship, if you will. That's about it.
Sam: Do we need a bigger vessel?
Laura: I have a feeling you don't believe this ship will make it back, do you?
Matt: "Well, that would not behoove me; I wish to keep my ships at dock where they're safe."
Laura: Of course. Yep.
Marisha: She's got a high-ass insurance policy on this bitch.
Taliesin: Clever.
Matt: "The crew is included. Go say hello. Hope to see you back in a few days." Whips around and walks her way back.
Travis: Did you see her eye? It didn't move. How does that happen?
Sam: She seemed very pleasant. Don't know what Fenna was talking about. Shall we away? Do we need to make any preparations before we go?
Taliesin: I think we're ready.
Sam: Do we have all of the materials we need?
Taliesin: Did we get the platinum from the bank, if I recall? I'm trying to remember.
Matt: Yeah, we'll say that that was your intent last time, that you made the conversion to platinum.
Taliesin: We would've platinumed.
Travis: Let's meet the crew.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Travis: How many crew are there?
Matt: There are three. Two of them appear to be the crustiest barnacles-- The gentleman that you met earlier, Fenna, looks like the brother of these two that mated. That really lived the life. Both of these men that are inside, that're playing cards hunched over the table, can't be younger than their early sixties. One of them has a big, thick, gnarled white beard that darkens at the tips which you can only imagine, as most hair tends to get lighter at the tips, means it's crusted with stuff. They're both wearing general seafaring garb and tattered clothing. They're muscular. Their skin is very tanned. One of them's wearing a heavy knitted cap that folds back onto itself and rests on his shoulder to the side. They are both playing cards and they look over. "I guess it's time to work." Takes the cards, pulls them up from the table. "All right, where we going?"
Laura: You strapping young lads are taking us out to the volcano.
Travis: Yeah, Scaldseat.
Matt: Both look at each other. "All right, let's wake up Santy."
Marisha: Santy? Shanty.
Matt: Santy.
Sam: Santy.
Travis: The name of the boat is the Sea Shanty, but the captain is Santy.
Matt: Santy of the Shanty. Technically, this is Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty.
Laura: The Shore Shanty?
Matt: Yeah. It's a mouthful.
Laura: Captain Santy of the Shore Shanty? I love it!
Matt: You watch as this large gentleman walks over and slams his fist on this small, wooden-- ugh, my brain isn't working. Thank you, a hatch in the ground. "We've got customers." And you hear this rustling beneath and all of a sudden the hatch slams up, and barreling out from underneath you see the drunkest, most unshaven, unwashed, gnarled goliath you've ever seen. No facial hair, but bits of frizzled dark hair in the back, which is interesting. Very few goliaths grow hair. Now what's interesting about this, too, is the size isn't as large as you height-wise, but width is about matching yours, so this is a bowling ball of a goliath. Steps up on the top. (grunts)
Laura: Only taller.
Liam: A large Danny DeVito.
Matt: Actually, yeah, that's a good point. But if Danny DeVito also was doing Iron Man competitions for a number of years and then let himself go, so he has the bulk of the muscle underneath but then-- Yeah. Doesn't say a word, just looks at you all and then walks out onto the deck of the ship.
Laura: Great.
Travis: Can I look down into the hatch where he came from? Can I see anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Liam: We're just going from point A to point B. This is just what we need.
Travis: Two.
Matt: It is dark, but you can smell the rum.
Travis: There's rum down there. Down there? There is rum.
Marisha: Well, we have five miles ahead of us.
Travis: Let's get shit-housed. Who cares what our responsibilities are?
Laura: How long would it take to go five miles on this fabulous ship?
Matt: Well, one of the two older gentlemen that were there, the one that knocked on the hatch, goes, (hums). Sticks his hand out the side of the doorway, "Maybe two hours? Three hours?"
Marisha: Ugh. No. I'm going to go fix with that. Whatever. You know what I'm saying. (wind noises)
Travis: We haven't even left the dock yet.
Matt: They pull the sail up, they get everything ready, they go ahead and undock from the dock, pull up anchor, and the general wind, because it's cliffside here, the wind is pretty strong right here at the bay, so immediately the sail billows open and the ship takes off. And they begin to curve in the direction, loosely, of where you were pointed earlier.
Marisha: After those initial winds, I take them and keep us going for a little bit.
Laura: I'm going to keep an eye on where the little guy said the volcano was and try to make sure our drunk captain is taking us to the right place.
Travis: After all, we are going on a three-hour tour.
Marisha: Actually, it should be only about half an hour, now!
Sam: Ooh! There's sound effects, first of all. Appreciate the sound effects. If we're going on a three-hour tour, I demand to know who's Gilligan, who's the Skipper, millionaire and his wife. The movie star--
Taliesin: Ginger.
Sam: Ginger, yeah.
Marisha: Well, then there's the Professor and Mary Ann. Yeah. Well, you may be the Professor. So maybe you're Mary Ann. Does that make me Ginger?
Liam: Well, wait. Wouldn't you be Thurston Howell III?
Taliesin: I feel like I would really be Thurston. I feel like Thurston's better.
Marisha: Yeah. Actually, yeah.
Laura: You're Mary Ann, you're Professor.
Liam: This is going to be very helpful against Vecna.
Matt: You're the crazy monkey on the island that kept fucking shit up.
Sam: Little buddy!
Matt: All right. As you set sail, the wind picks up, speed is enhanced and you gather at this rate probably in under two hours you'll probably make it to the destination with the help of the Air Ashari--
Marisha: It's a 2nd-level spell. Gust of Wind.
Matt: So as it guides on, Captain Santy stands at the front of the ship glancing out, this giant square jaw just nestled right into where the pecs meet up beneath the thick sweater that's almost hanging off the arms at this point. No cap, balding head with the scraggly hair in the back, and just looks off in the distance. The rest of the two are just sitting back where there are various jugs of some unseen liquid, keeping tabs on the sail. It's a very leisurely, lackadaisical energy on this ship.
Liam: How many feet, I guess, is this ship from front to back?
Matt: Front to back, I'd say it's about 25 feet.
Sam: We're crammed on this thing.
Matt: This is a tiny ship. It's 25 to 30 feet.
Laura: There's no way to go any faster on this? Is there no way to go faster, Captain?
Matt: Captain? You say this to the captain? He goes--
Laura: Do you go out to this volcano often? Lovely.
Marisha: Santy is so wise.
Travis: Why do you say that?
Marisha: He sees the sea. Look at him.
Taliesin: We can all see the sea. It's right there.
Marisha: Santy of the Shanty seas sees the sea.
Matt: And he points out and you glance out at where Santy of the Shore Shanty is, and you can see in the distance there's a little line of dark that is rising out of the ocean.
Laura: Oh, you found it.
Taliesin: Santy of the Shore Shanty spotted--
Travis: I will throw something.
Marisha: Do you think Santy of the Shore Shanty sells sea shells?
Taliesin: Surely not.
Matt: Rocks fall. Everyone dies. Quickly enough, you begin to approach and you can now see what was a thin column is now a fairly large billowing stream of dark fume that you can see as the waves get larger and larger the further out you go. Certain swells, some of it breaks up and it chains and snakes upward, based on how it's finding its way to the surface. Eventually, you get within maybe 30, 40 feet of where it breaks the surface there, and the sails fall into loose and are tied around the bottom, anchor is thrown off the side, chain is let down, and then eventually the captain turns back and--
Laura: All right.
Sam: All right.
Travis: Jeez. Hold on. I saw you drop anchor. Do you have an idea of how deep it is here?
Matt: Glances over the side.
Laura: Very deep. Is your chain long enough for your anchor to hit bottom? Cool.
Liam: I'm sorry do you-- do you talk, ever?
Matt: As soon as you say that question, the two other older gnarled gentlemen on the ship go (noises of warning). Captain is just staring at you. (spits) Spits on the ground before you.
Marisha: I see you're also skilled in interpretive dance. You're very good.
Travis: Oh shit. The ship will be gone when we come back up.
Liam: I don't wanna waste time on the gnome business. Let's just go on.
Sam: Let's do this.
Marisha: Water Breathing!
Laura: Oh, and Trinket!
Marisha: And Trinket. (poof)
Laura: I had him in the necklace because it was such a tiny little boat, but now he's out.
Matt: Yeah. All right. With that, you all have water breathing.
Laura: Oh wait, can he swim? He's good. He did it before, right?
Matt: Yeah. He's as good at swimming as half of your party.
Laura: He's an expert now after the kraken fight.
Sam: What?
Taliesin: I'm so glad I don't have to do that. You just do it for me. It's very nice.
Marisha: Keyleth uses Alter Self to give herself the gill hands. The webbed fingers again. That was cool.
Travis: You got to do a proper paddy entry into the water. (splash)
Matt: Perfect. As each of you make your way into the water (splashing). You can smell, by the way, the fumes. Because you see the dark color of it, you immediately envision or at least instinctively prepare for the smell of fire smoke or a fireplace. As soon as it hits you, it's a very acrid, sharp metallic smell with hints of sulfur and other chemicals that burn the inside of your nose and sinuses immediately.
Liam: In the water, going up our noses?
Matt: It's the proximity. Being near, you can smell occasionally as the wind blows through, a whiff gets to you. You all make your way under the surface and begin to swim down, following with your vision where the source of this dark column of fume is.
Travis: Do we have good visibility?
Matt: It's all right.
Travis: 40 feet? 60 feet?
Matt: I'd say about 60 feet or so before it gets a little murky.
Taliesin: I think I've still got one more charge on the flashlight, if I recall.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: The red light?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so you guys make your way... down below. Who's leading this? I should get a marching order for underwater, by the way.
Liam: I will go ahead.
Laura: I'm useless and Percy's useless underwater.
Taliesin: Extremely useless.
Matt: Percy has the light, too.
Taliesin: I'll be in the middle.
Marisha: I'll be with Percy, more up front.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: I'll be just behind Percival.
Matt: All righty. Grog?
Travis: Where should I be?
Matt: You're sinking faster than most anybody.
Travis: Yeah. How about I'm the down-weighter system for whoever's in the front? I'll hold onto their ankles.
Matt: Is Trinket in your necklace or swimming, as well?
Laura: He's out. He's swimming.
Matt: Okay, so Trinket's trying to keep up next to you. Scanlan, where are you?
Sam: I'm probably next to Percy.
Matt: All right, so you guys begin making your way down. You can breathe the water just fine as you descend 40, 60 feet, 80 feet.
Laura: I'm equalizing.
Travis: You're breathing water. It's not necessary.
Laura: Really? Your ears wouldn't pop, still?
Travis: There's no air in your sinuses.
Laura: Oh, right. Okay, cool.
Matt: It's funny. You mention equalizing, and I can't help but try and do it myself now.
Travis: Quick question. Like in space, can we talk underwater if there's no air going through our vocal cords? Cool.
Laura: Oh, good. We can't communicate.
Matt: I'll say because you have the earring, it's a little garbled, but you can hear it a little bit.
Marisha: It's like that game we all played when we were growing up.
Matt: You can make out the gist of things, but depending on how fast you're talking, it could be hard to hear. It's getting darker and darker the further down you descend, and the water gets murkier and murkier. It also gets warmer.
Travis: Stop peeing, Vax.
Matt: (chuckles) I was waiting for it.
Laura: You called him Vex.
Liam: Vax, and I said sorry at the same time, so I'm peeing right now, is what I'm saying.
Matt: It's good. It leads you into it. Descending further and further, the only visible light that you have is the one that Percival is shining below, and as it goes through, you can see it reveals another 40 or so feet ahead of you, and then as you pass over, it suddenly becomes shorter and then longer again as it comes and hits the smoke, and you can see the smoke and the fume now. It's billowing up at a rapid pace, and the water is getting hotter and hotter, to the point where now it's starting to feel like a sauna.
Laura: (garbled) We didn't think about fire resistance, did we?
Matt: About another 20 or so feet, and it's hot enough to stand, but it's getting really uncomfortable, and with Percival's light, you can see the bottom. (soft impact) You guys all land there at the bottom of the ocean. It's so dark that outside of Percival's light and the glow around you, you only see the outline of each other from the splash-back of the light as he projects it around.
Laura: Does anybody have any light?
Marisha: I can light up my flame hands.
Travis: You're underwater.
Matt: You're underwater.
Marisha: But it's magic. I thought it doesn't matter?
Matt: I will say, you get a little bit there, and it's fighting against it. It's a very faint glow. You can see where Keyleth is, but it doesn't add any light to the rest of this.
Travis: (garbled noises)
Liam: (garbled noises)
Laura: We really need to say stuff, though, because no one's going to be able to understand us. (laughter)
Travis: Do you see anything around us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I may join in on that, because I have a flashlight.
Liam: 28.
Matt: You guys both have disadvantage on this, by the way, because of the lack of visibility.
Liam: 28.
Laura: Scanlan, don't you have Dancing Lights or anything?
Taliesin: 21.
Sam: I can make a Fireball. (garbled) I can make a Fireball, but it will probably go out really quick.
Laura: (garbled) Don't you have a Dancing Lights cantrip or some shit like that?
Sam: (garbled) No.
Laura: (garbled) Lame.
Matt: All right, so glancing down, you can see you guys are standing on a rising upward cone; the top of the volcano at this point, where you can see all the ground below you, especially immediately around where the water or the fume is gushing out, is porous, dark rock. There's no soot; there's no soft surface that you hit. There's no usual bottom of the ocean you expect. Yeah, no sediment. It's just hard rock. The force of the vents seems to be pushing any of the sediment off, and it descends slowly around you and disappears into the darkness. You can see a number of small-- strangely enough, with the heat of the surrounding area, too, you can see little bursts of color within the porous rock, and with a quick glance, Vax, you can see there are bits of plant life, colorful pinks and purples that are slowly pulled into the porous rock on the outside of these vents. You can see a very faint glow in a couple of places of the rock where it looks there is still some sort of very hot, very slow pressurizing molten rock that is cooling slowly. It looks like there's this constant slow battle between the ocean water and whatever's forcing upward.
Marisha: Do I see any-- (garbled) Do I see--
Matt: (whispering) Don't, please. (laughter)
Matt: Please don't.
Liam: It sickens me. (laughter)
Marisha: Are there any pockets other than the main pressure point that might be a smooth entry point?
Matt: Right now, where it's emerging, these jets of extremely hot fume that are billowing past you, it looks like there's one concentrated opening at the moment. As you walk around, it looks like it's not one central column. It looks like there's a number of smaller fissures that are all clustered around this area, and it's hard to see the separation because so much of it's mashing into one giant column as it emerges.
Marisha: Okay. Yeah. All right, so it's hot water and gas coming up. If I theoretically wanted to do a Control Water spell and reverse the water inwards, could we go in through one of these tunnels? Through one of these fissures?
Matt: You can certainly try.
Taliesin: I hate that phrase.
Travis: You've got the Death Ward. Go for it!
Marisha: I'm more thinking for all of us. I don't know how else we're going to get in.
Laura: Can you make yourself a fire elemental, and it won't damage you if you go-- or will water fuck with you?
Matt: Oh, water will fuck with you as a fire elemental.
Marisha: I could be a water elemental, though.
Matt: You could.
Travis: Should we walk around? The volcano, is it massive?
Matt: You don't know. Your visibility vanishes about 40 feet away from you.
Liam: And we're just seeing little glows in the distance?
Matt: You're seeing little glows within the actual areas where the fumes are spewing up. You're seeing down where the smoke is emerging. You're seeing every now and then a faint glow that appears here and there.
Taliesin: Are the faint glows repetitive, like they're coming from the same place over and over again?
Matt: Yeah. It looks like the glow is stationary. It's just the smoke obscuring it as it passes by and occasionally gives you a glimpse.
Taliesin: Let's head towards the glow.
Laura: Yeah. It might be magma coming out, though.
Travis: There are tunnels that exist already.
Taliesin: It might be magma. Also, if we see anything resembling an air bubble, then we know there's something that breathes.
Marisha: If we want to wait a few minutes, I could do a Commune With Nature.
Laura: Yeah, do that. That's smart! Yeah.
Marisha: I'm going to be like, underwater tea party! (glugging) And do a Commune With Nature for a little bit. I get three questions? I want to find any easy tunnels.
Laura: Man-made tunnels.
Marisha: Man-made tunnels that aren't going to bake us alive.
Laura: Any dangerous creatures in the area.
Marisha: Any dangerous creatures in the area. That's good. And the Anvil. Okay.
Matt: Because of the nature of this, the radius is limited to 300 feet because it's considered a somewhat underground, not out-in-the-open setting.
Marisha: All right, yeah, 300 feet.
Matt: All right, so. You take the minute and concentrate beneath. And with that, all of a sudden you feel your conscious extend into the rock and stone and the various forms of plant life that have made home around the outskirts of the top of this volcano's caldera. Your questions are?
Marisha: Are there any man-made tunnels that will grant us access into the volcano without burning us alive?
Laura: And where are they?
Marisha: And where are they?
Sam: That's two questions.
Matt: No.
Travis: Man-made is not important.
Sam: How about, any tunnels?
Marisha: Are there any tunnels getting into the volcano?
Matt: You feel the sense of the rock and the surrounding material guide your attention, very focused, into the center of where that fume is erupting.
Taliesin: Oh. Okay.
Liam: The Anvil is probably too far away at this point. Yeah, it's probably not right here at the top. What about these colorful plant things floating past us? Are they going to sting us and paralyze us?
Sam: Should we find out, from nature, how far down in the magma it is?
Travis: Yeah, what the location of the Anvil is?
Marisha: I'm afraid that 300 feet--
Laura: But maybe it'll know how far away it is, even though it can only-- Does it work that way?
Marisha: Within 300 feet, I can see the area.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Liam: Said the fantasy heroes.
Marisha: Yeah. Hostile creatures! Hostile creatures in the area.
Matt: Hostile creatures in the area?
Marisha: Dangerous hostile creatures. How many more adjectives can I throw in there?
Liam: Pissy.
Taliesin: Irritated creatures.
Travis: Starving.
Marisha: Do harm. Ill will.
Matt: Terrain. Bodies of water. Prevalent plants, minerals, animals or peoples. Powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals or undead. You do get a very faint sense of elemental movement. You're not quite sure what that pertains to specifically, but it is moving just outside the radius of your sphere of understanding here at the top of the volcano, and it is moving slowly through rock.
Laura: There you go.
Sam: Through rock.
Marisha: Earth elemental.
Laura: So we need to go in the top, yeah?
Travis: Or through rock. You can make tunnels, right?
Marisha: I can make tunnels.
Travis: I would prefer to do that than go down the barrel of the shotgun, but that's just me.
Sam: Travis, can you say that with your finger flapping on your mouth please?
Travis: (garbled) No. (laughter)
Marisha: Are we concerned if I start boring tunnels into the side of this that magma and pressure will start releasing out the side?
Travis: I'm just saying.
Sam: He's just saying.
Liam: Vax swims down towards the cone. And I think the last time I talked about the Deathwalker's Ward, I'd set it to fire, so we'll say fire.
Sam: Immune to or resistant to?
Matt: Resistant to.
Marisha: Is my mantle helping with the heat?
Matt: Yeah, the heat isn't bothering you as much. It helps with extreme heat as a general weather type, but intensely dangerous heat like fire or anything, it's not going to help you with that. So you dive into the center?
Travis: Yeah, I forgot. He's like a crash test dummy. We'll worry about that later.
Matt: You watch as Vax disappears into the liquid. The pressure is a lot. I need you to make an athletics check first.
Liam: Okay, that's what I'm best at. Athletics. Natural 20. Thanks, Matt Colville.
Matt: You swim down into the darkness and you're using your sense of balance to keep tabs on what is up and what is down, because once you dive into the middle of this pillar you see nothing. And you begin to swim down, feeling for where the gravity is pulling you and the force against you, and use that to get your bearings.
Liam: I know it's probably fuck-all, but I'm going to pull out the Flametongue Dagger and try to use it as a shitty-ass--
Matt: You can faintly see a little bit of it there. You do take three points of fire damage as soon as you enter the water, reduced to one. So you manage to push through and descend about 15 or so, 20 feet. You suffer another six points of fire damage, reduced to three. Need you to make another athletics check, please, as you're pushing further and further down.
Liam: Use my first Luck of the day. Oh, not good. Same thing. Just a six.
Matt: A six? It begins to push you up, you lose a little bit of ground. You take another one point of fire damage. You begin to make up, and you get partway down. You get another 40 or so feet down into it, you think. Still unable to really see anything. Occasionally, you see a glint of that light that you saw before. The little bit of glow. You take another three points of fire damage, reduced to one. It is a lot of heat, but you continue to push further. Make another athletics check, a third one.
Liam: 20, total.
Matt: 20? (grunting) Pushing along, still making your way down, making your way down. You get probably another 80 or so feet before it seems to curve off a little bit to the side. The force of the water begins to shift a little bit. You take another three points of fire damage. You begin to see a faint bit of that glow that you were following earlier, and as you head towards it the heat gets more and more intense. You begin to push past some of the smoke, and you can see right there, looks like there's a glowing ember of rock about five or six feet wide that is molten rock that is slowly cooling as it's being pushed faintly out, but the force of the water curves off to the side and you continue to swim away from where that glowing ember is and following the path of where this push of water is. You take another two points of fire damage.
Liam: Okay. I'm Ed Harris, sinking down and down and down.
Matt: The temperature is going up. You continue to swim, continue to swim. Further down, further down, further down. Make another athletics check.
Liam: 16.
Matt: Okay. You're slowing down a bit, but you're still getting ground. You also take another three points of fire damage. This is getting hard.
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: And even your form, you're getting a little tired, having to go against this force. And you're not quite sure where this is going to lead you. You're not going to stumble across an opening where it's fine to walk. You're continuing to swim down a superheated--
Liam: I'm going to push it just a little bit more.
Matt: Okay, make another athletics check.
Liam: Okay. That's not good. That's a seven.
Matt: Okay. You get pushed back about 15 feet or so, and you take another three points of fire damage.
Liam: And I'll go with it, up.
Matt: Okay. You ride up. Before you can get entirely out of the column, you take another three points of fire damage and eventually emerge from the side of it. Uncomfortable.
Liam: Back into warm piss water, instead of boiling hot.
Matt: Yes, which comparatively is much more comfortable.
Liam: Nope!
Travis: What did you see?
Liam: I mean. You can't really understand me though, can they? Right? It's all shit.
Laura: Oh, we can understand you.
Matt: You have the earring on.
Liam: It goes forever. I think we need to look elsewhere. I don't think all of us are going to make it down that fucking tunnel.
Marisha: What if I'm controlling the currents?
Liam: (sighs) That would help. It was getting hot as hell down there. I don't know. I mean, maybe a quick look around the perimeter of this thing?
Marisha: I didn't find anything.
Travis: Yeah, but it might be worth it. We don't even know what the Core Anvil looks like.
Taliesin: We have a broom.
Liam: We're not going to muscle our way down.
Laura: No, it doesn't do anything in-- it flies.
Taliesin: Does it not work underwater?
Laura: I can try. But it flies.
Travis: I mean, no.
Matt: You can certainly try.
Laura: Yeah. It'll just sit.
Liam: Well, I think we're either druiding our way in or looking for another way in, somehow.
Laura: Fuck. How long did that take?
Matt: He was gone for about a minute. Minute and a half.
Sam: I have an idea. What if I could make us a tunnel straight down the middle? Would the heat kill us or would the water tamp down the heat? If I can make a ten-foot wide tunnel all the way through, down?
Laura: With no water?
Travis: It might make another exhaust port for the heat and the water.
Marisha: That's what I was saying. I'm afraid of the pressure.
Sam: The pressure of what? Once it comes up, it becomes rock. Oh, I see. There's more underneath.
Travis: You didn't see tunnels, right? You didn't see tunnels in the sides of the volcano?
Liam: No.
Travis: Because we're not trying to go down, we're trying to find the tunnels.
Sam: What tunnels?
Travis: There are tunnels here.
Laura: There are tunnels here.
Matt: Both Percival and Scanlan, make an intelligence check, please.
Sam: Just a straight intelligence check?
Matt: Just whatever you roll plus your intelligence modifier.
Sam: Eight!
Taliesin: 14.
Matt: 14. On this discussion of burrowing deeper within, if there were any places where you could walk that were not completely filled with water, per se, the minute you exposed it, it would begin to fill with water. Which means you'd have think of a way to either plug it or just stay wherever water exists within the system beneath.
Travis: Right. I don't know if we're trying to get to the inside of the volcano shaft.
Marisha: Our water breathing lasts for 24 hours.
Taliesin: Let's roll around a little bit. See if we can see anything else.
Laura: Maybe we can go around the perimeter and see if we can find some sort of entrance. Some magical-looking entrance.
Marisha: Scanlan, your burrowing. What means are you using for that?
Sam: Magic.
Marisha: Touché.
Sam: Sorry, Miley Cyrus.
Travis: There's a chance the Core Anvil could be made of molten rock, right? There's nothing that says it's a not dangerous, totally cool to be around piece of thing.
Marisha: I have a feeling that's exactly what it is. It's going to suck working around that thing. Sorry.
Travis: I'm not worried about it. Well, we've got to find whatever it is. We don't even know what it looks like!
Laura: Do you know, Percival, what it looks like? Did you see it in your mind's eye?
Matt: You only have the construct of the actual trammel, not the anvil.
Travis: Yeah, when I was getting the upload from Morpheus, did I see what the Core Anvil might look like? Or was it just like, I'm just hammering and Rambo 2 montage music is playing.
Matt: More that.
Marisha: Scanlan?
Sam: Yes?
Marisha: Okay. Can we tag-team this?
Sam: All right, I can be a burrowing monster.
Marisha: Okay, what if you burrow and I push the water away--
Sam: Is that a spell?
Marisha: Yeah, Control Water. I can push it away, and if you do that, then maybe we can all get in and then maybe I can throw up a wall!
Sam: All right, I can burrow. You can deflect water and stuff?
Laura: Through the mountain? Through the volcano, instead of down the top, like he just did.
Sam: Whatever you want.
Marisha: Or I can control the currents and suck us all right through down the top.
Taliesin: I like "control the currents." I don't know.
Sam: But the currents can't go down because stuff is coming out, no?
Marisha: As part of Control Water, I can reverse the currents.
Sam: But you can't control the lava coming up.
Marisha: No, it's water and gas and pressure.
Sam: Oh, it's just gas. It's not lava.
Matt: You can also part water, don't forget, as a part of this, too. You can also part water.
Marisha: I can also part water, like fucking Moses.
Matt: Yeah, or redirect flow. Or create a whirlpool. There are all things you can do.
Laura: Solid, then let's try it.
Liam: What were you thinking? Were you thinking of Umbrasyling this shit, were you going to black dragon dig your way down?
Sam: I was going to become a purple worm. They're excellent at burrowing and are big and could make a big tunnel.
Laura: Are they resistant to water and heat?
Sam: No, but they are stacked with hit points.
Laura: Solid.
Marisha: That would be one of your top-level spells, yeah?
Sam: The toppest.
Laura: Let's not do that just yet. Let's control current and see if we can fucking do it, with some light this time.
Travis: We need a walk. Walk the perimeter
Marisha: I mean, we can still walk the perimeter if you want.
Liam: I mean, we got a little under 24 hours. Fuck it, let's look.
Marisha: We can walk the perimeter
Taliesin: Let's do a little walk of the perimeter, and when we're ready, we're going to jump down and we'll Mary Poppins it.
Matt: Okay, so you guys begin to make your way around, spiraling the outside of this.
Taliesin: Looking, using the light.
Matt: Okay, what are you looking for?
Taliesin: I'm looking for other expelling gasses, interesting plant growth, lights.
Liam: Anything that looks not-natural.
Travis: Yeah, caves.
Matt: Okay, everyone who's looking, make an investigation check.
Marisha: Investigation? Natural 20. (cheers)
Travis: Oh, minus two. 17.
Taliesin: 14.
Liam: 18.
Laura: Ten.
Matt: As you guys are glancing about, for over the next 15 or so minutes, just swimming around and keeping an eye out there, Keyleth, with your glowing hands and cruising across as you head down, you can feel a couple of other small changes in the current. Less of a fume release, more than there is a warmer area of water in a small area and you find there is a pressurized jet of water coming out of one section maybe about 25 to 30 feet down on the side.
Laura: Hey! You're smart, Grog!
Marisha: How big is the jet?
Matt: I'd say it's between about three feet long on one side and about a foot long on the other. It's a fissure.
Laura: So we can get through it?
Marisha: Yeah, can Grog fit?
Matt: No.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: But can Trinket fit?
Matt: No, Trinket or Grog, neither of them can fit. Most of you guys have to squeeze through, and it's as hot as the water that was coming out of the top.
Marisha: Is it made out of stone? Can I call this earth? Can I call this rock?
Matt: It's considered rock. It's volcanic rock.
Marisha: So Move Earth would not work?
Taliesin: Or Grog can punch it.
Laura: Yeah, Grog can punch.
Marisha: You are good at destroying structures.
Sam: You're going to punch a volcano?
Matt: Yeah, dirt, sand, or clay, so I'm going to say no.
Marisha: Can I transmute the rock into dirt or sand to give us a little more?
Matt: If you have a means of doing that, you could.
Marisha: I have Transmute Rock. Or we can let Grog go first.
Taliesin: Let's let Grog punch a volcano.
Matt: You want to punch a volcano?
Travis: Kind of.
Taliesin: Teach it to say your name!
Matt: Roll a strength check.
Travis: (garbled) Say my name, bitch!
Laura: Don't you get advantage?
Travis: I do. Only if I'm raging.
Matt: I'll give you advantage on this because it's a volcano punch.
Travis: Hey! Oh, 26.
Laura: Don't you get advantage because of your gauntlets?
Matt: Well, no. The gauntlets don't give him advantage, but they do give him siege and he does double damage against structures and I'll consider this a natural structure. You rear back, and as you do, you guys watch. You haven't really watched him use this type of power in the dark before, and you watch as the faint bit of a few yellow runes glow as he pulls back and then slams into the side and you watch as rock breaks and bits of the volcanic rock break off and begin to tumble down the sides. He punches again and punches again and as you do watch the water flow, you feel the warmth come up. You immediately take six points of fire damage from the heated jet in front of you, but as you slam it one more time, part of it (rock collapsing) gives away underneath as one side of it begins to jet up, you watch as it looks like there is a gap or an air pocket that collapses inward and the water begins to fill in immediately.
Laura: Let's get in quick and then cover it. We go fast, go in.
Matt: Okay. You guys are all fighting against the current?
Laura: Well, didn't you say there was an air pocket?
Matt: Well there was an air pocket that you saw, but the stone as he punched in, as soon as it collapsed inward it was away from where the jet was. It's a very interesting thing to try and describe here in a theater of mind scenario.
Marisha: We're trying to go through an outward jet to this caved-in air pocket.
Matt: Yeah, essentially you've opened up where the jet's strength has diminished a little bit at the surface at this point, and you've watched as you've punched and there will be another chamber below that was an air chamber collapsed inward, and ocean water is rushing into it right now.
Marisha: Okay, okay. Let me Control Water with the current, and can I redirect the current up and around us to allow us to get in?
Matt: Okay, so Control Water takes an action to cast. So as soon as that happens, you finish the spell and as the ocean water begins to rush in (water rushing), it immediately pulls back out, and you can actually stop the current that's blowing upward and heated water is held in place, and you can look down below. The water is this slightly shimmering barrier and there is a small air-filled chamber below.
Marisha: Okay, yeah, I'm pushing the water, parting it, giving us a little.
Sam: Can we fit through whatever hole there is?
Matt: Actually, looking down inside, it looks to be roughly 20 or so feet wide on almost any other side, and it looks to be that there's a small, still pool that is there in the ground. It's a small air pocket.
Laura: Yeah, I go in after him.
Matt: Okay, you all rush inside there. You land past it and it's about a 15 foot drop, you all land on your feet or stumble off to one side and catch yourself, but you're now in this chamber beneath.
Sam: And the only thing keeping the water from rushing in here is Keyleth?
Matt: Keyleth currently, yeah.
Laura: I like how everything is like, "Keyleth can do this." Can you wall it off with Create Wall?
Sam: Well, not while casting this spell.
Marisha: All right, push the water, Wall of Stone (boom).
Matt: As soon as the water pushes away, it begins to pull back, and immediately you can hear the rush of the ocean suddenly, oppressively, darting downward to fill the space where you are and then with that, (slamming) you watch as volcanic stone stretches out and slams shut. You're now in a pitch-black room except for the surface of his light and the glowing of Keyleth's hands.
Laura: Yay! Which are brighter now because we're not in water.
Marisha: Oh!
Taliesin: Ow, my ears popped.
Sam: That was amazing!
Laura: That was fucking sick!
Marisha: You punched a volcano!
Travis: I did, didn't I? Grog versus the volcano!
Matt: As you guys have this conversation, you're talking, and sounds are happening, everything's fine. But, (exhales) breath is hard.
Marisha: Oh, oxygen?
Sam: Or poison?
Travis: Air pocket.
Matt: All of the air in here is poisoned. There is no oxygen in this room. There is that pool of water in the center, maybe four-foot wide, and you can see it's kind of bubbling a bit, like whatever the fume is that's filled the space is--
Liam: How does Heroes' Feast factor into this? Heroes' Feast. Doesn't that guard against poison?
Matt: You're not poisoned. You're not having toxic shock and dying right now, but you're suffocating.
Taliesin: I'm going to put my face in the water and breathe.
Matt: It's not affecting you. You're fine.
Laura: Oh, because you don't breathe.
Sam: You're already dead.
Marisha: Weirdo.
Travis: Yeah, put your face in the water and breathe.
Taliesin: I'm putting my face in the water and attempting to take a breath.
Matt: The bubbling of air there is the same fume here.
Taliesin: I'm just trying to use the water breath.
Matt: Oh, the water breath itself? Oh, with the water breathing? The water you can breathe.
Laura: Oh, great! So any time we need a breath we just breathe, okay!
Taliesin: We might start getting a little loopy if we stay out here for too long.
Travis: Vex, will you look for anything that looks like a Core Anvil? And I stick my face in.
Laura: I take a breath and I start looking for a door or any way out of this.
Taliesin: I'm going to open the light fully.
Liam: Flametongue Dagger is out so I can see the non-water portion.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. You go in and take a breath and you look down below, especially with the light and the lamp that's going around, you can see where this is happening, this little pool, it's another small tube that descends farther and curves away out of sight.
Laura: (gasps) Is it wide enough for all of to fit through?
Matt: Well, from what you can see before it curves off, it looks like it could probably fit everybody.
Laura: Hey! There's a tunnel down there!
Taliesin: I'm going to tilt the light into it and take a look down.
Matt: Okay. Looking down, it does; it's a curvature off, it looks like at one point there was some sort of an escape, or at least that jet that you originally found earlier? Part of it got blocked off and while the get of water continued, the opening here kind of got covered with some sort of liquid rock and it created this pocket. You can swim down there. Who knows where it leads, but it does not appear to have any sort of a forceful jet.
Sam: It's a tube? We're in one of the cow's stomachs.
Matt: Essentially.
Marisha: Control Water lasts up to ten minutes, so if we want to commit to this, I can help jettison us there.
Matt: You have to cast it again, though, because you lost concentration.
Marisha: Why?
Travis: Because you made a Wall of Stone.
Marisha: We decided early on that Wall of Stone was instantaneous. And permanent.
Matt: Permanent and concentration. Yeah, okay, I'll let you go with that.
Marisha: Because it was in Pathfinder.
Travis: Do we want to get rid of the water, though? Because that's what's allowing us to breathe.
Marisha: The water? Just happens. Us breathing water is good for 24 hours.
Sam: But if we get rid of the water, then we won't have anything to breathe.
Marisha: No, I'm going to Control Water, and I'm going to jettison us with the current.
Sam: Okay, go for it.
Laura: Let's take it a little slow because we don't know what we're coming up to, though. I don't want to jump full-force into--
Marisha: Yeah. It'll be like Lazy River.
Laura: Something like that. Lead the way, darling.
Matt: Well, how the spell works is if you maintain concentration for the whole duration, it becomes permanent.
Marisha: For the whole duration?
Matt: For the whole duration. Which is ten minutes.
Marisha: But I haven't done that because I've already jettisoned this one water, and then now I'm trying to use the remaining--
Matt: It's fine. Don't worry about it.
Laura: Let's just go in the water. I follow him. Although Percy should technically be up front because he's got light.
Matt: Okay, so Percival goes first, followed by Vax, then Vex.
Travis: Me in the middle.
Matt: Grog. Is Trinket still swimming along with you?
Laura: Trinket is behind Grog.
Matt: All right. And then that's Scanlan and Keyleth at the very end. All right. You guys dive past under the water. It curves, and you can see there's a faint light source in the distance. This curves below. It splinters downward and then curves up slightly, and that's where the light source is coming from.
Travis: Yeah, of course. Air pocket.
Liam: I'm going to go stealth.
Matt: Make a stealth check.
Travis: Do your Navy SEAL shit.
Liam: That's fine.
Travis: Come out of the water, eyes open.
Liam: 34.
Sam: 34? Jesus.
Matt: All right. You think you're pretty stealth.
Liam: I think I'm pretty stealth.
Matt: You think you're pretty stealth.
Liam: All right.
Travis: I don't like the way he said that.
Laura: I know!
Matt: Go upward?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Okay. As you get up, you see a familiar orangeish-red glow, and as you see the surface of water above you, there's another, looks like an air pocket. You emerge. You look about, and it looks like there is another tunnel here, but there's a faint glow. It looks like there are small veins of cooling volcanic rock in this area. The tunnel continues. There's actually ground that you can walk on that continues down and curves out of the way.
Travis: The walls are cooling?
Liam: I just turn to the group and I'm going to--
Laura: Can you see by the light of the magma?
Matt: You can see fairly, with your elven vision, yeah, and with your dagger. So yeah, you begin to walk on the surface. The surface is cooled, and it's very hot in here. But not painfully so, like when you dove into the caldera itself. You walk down about ten or 15 feet and you see it's now breaking off in various directions. You can see small pockets where it closes off, areas where it looks like whatever air or gases were trapped up when parts of the volcano would expand and pressurize upward, it would trap these areas. But you see areas where liquid rock are spilling into and creating small pools. And it continues to descend, almost like a curved spiral, around the way.
Liam: So there's a walkway, but there's also lava?
Matt: Very faint trickles, and cools slowly on the floor.
Liam: I've only gone about 20 feet at this point, is that right? I am going to go around the bend. Continuing quietly.
Matt: You go around the bend, and you can hear faintly the rushing of water, muffled. You're not that far away, you gather, from spatial awareness as to where the heavy pressure of the water that was forced upward, you can faintly feel the vibration. But as you curve away it gets dimmer and dimmer, as you spiral off further away from the center of this volcano. And as it continues to spiral downward, this natural air pocket cavern, it splits again into a small opening where it's settled, faintly orange glowing, with spots of black molten rock that's slowly cooling. The path curves around the way, and it splits into two pockets of this cooling rock. And then maybe about a five-foot leap to continue downward.
Marisha: Over lava?
Matt: Your favorite.
Marisha: So bad at it.
Matt: I know.
Liam: I'm going to double back to the group.
Taliesin: I think we're already starting to make our way out.
Liam: It goes a little further, but I just didn't want to go too far on my own.
Laura: What did you see?
Liam: Just goes further. But I don't want to get separated completely, so come up a bit, and I'll go a little bit further.
Sam: Can we walk on it? Is it going to burn our little feetsies? Or do we need to fly?
Liam: I don't think so.
Laura: Up and over. Let's-- yeah. Let's go up there.
Travis: We follow Vax.
Laura: Can we cast Locate Object on the anvil? Don't you have something that sends a direct path to an object?
Marisha: Find the Path? But I think I have to have seen the object before. It would also burn my last 6th-level spell.
Liam: I could do it, but you have to be familiar with it. Being told about it doesn't count, does it?
Matt: You don't have enough information to do that, yeah. You guys all emerge from the water to gather up with Vax.
Liam: I'd like to lead them to where that jump is.
Matt: Okay. As you all take a deep breath under the water and get to the surface, you make a test breath and the air in this pocket is still poisonous and not breathable, so you guys are going to have to take a deep breath under the water and hold your breath as you make your way down that tunnel.
Laura: Oh fuck. Were there any other pockets of water along the way?
Liam: Shit. Get back in the water. And I'm going to solo go where I wasn't intending to, to see how far it is to get to the next bit of water. You said it was a jump over magma?
Matt: Yep.
Laura: Does your creepy undead brain remember how long it takes before we die if we don't breathe? Do you remember that?
Liam: I walk away from her, and I go down the hall.
Matt: All right. It's a decent jump to get over the lava. It's not a hard one, necessarily, but I want you to make an athletics check, anyway.
Liam: Ooh, better use one of my Lucks for that. That was a one. Ooh! Six.
Matt: Six.
Liam: Six. Burn, baby, burn.
Matt: Total of six?
Liam: Yeah, total of six. Already used Luck; it's done.
Marisha: Why does this always happen to us?
Travis: I don't know, but I love it.
Matt: You run and make a leap, and you're pretty sure you made it, but one foot (sizzle) right into it.
Taliesin: Is it the same foot?
Marisha: Is it the same foot?
Matt: It's the same foot.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Marisha: Yeah!
Matt: Thankfully, your armor is set to resist.
Taliesin: Okay, that's right. That was early on. Wow.
Liam: And yet Vax ain't sweating it. Not anymore.
Taliesin: It's nothing you haven't had to regrow before.
Laura: Does your Raven Queen regenerate lost footsies?
Matt: What would have been 56 damage is reduced to 28 fire damage to you. You pull out real fast. (sizzle, groan) It burns and burns and burns. Kick it off. You keep walking around the curvature, and it takes about two minutes or so of brisk travel to get around the corner where you can see another pool of warm water.
Laura: Two minutes.
Liam: So I see water and I shove my face down in it and breathe it. Who knows, with me? And I go back to where I burned my fucking foot, and I go into the earring-- I'm not going to fucking jump over that shit again-- tell them what I saw. Yeah, two minutes. So deep fucking breath. Yeah?
Laura: Ugh, two minutes.
Liam: And when you see me, run towards me and follow me.
Laura: Yeah. All right. Grog?
Travis: What?
Laura: Are you good to run and jump over some lava?
Travis: Nope.
Matt: So as you guys are aware, you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus your constitution modifier.
Laura: (laughs) Oh no.
Travis: Awesome!
Laura: Okay, but you were on foot. If I'm on the broom, then maybe it wouldn't take as long, potentially.
Matt: You were making a careful path. If you were to continue to dash, full dash run, it would be close. You can try it.
Laura: Okay. I'm going to put Trinket in the necklace.
Matt: All right. Trinket in the necklace.
Laura: Do you want to get on the broom with me?
Taliesin: I've got the boots, so I was going to use my boots.
Laura: All right, anybody? Scanlan?
Sam: Yes, please.
Travis: It's just a thought, but I do have the big-ass jug that can make a big thing of portable water.
Laura: (gasps) Sick!
Marisha: Wait, we're waterboarding ourselves?
Travis: Well, you can breathe in that shit, right? We won't be able to see.
Taliesin: Can we fit our head in that jug?
Matt: Yeah, you can.
Taliesin: You've just got to carry the jug, and as long as we stick our head in the jug every time we need to breathe-- you're a genius! You're a genius! I will say that seven more times. We'll space them out.
Sam: We might run out of water, though, because we're breathing it in.
Travis: You're breathing it back out. You're recycling it. It'll get a little less oxygenated.
Liam: How long does a fish live in a fish tank?
Sam: You're right. We're big fish.
Liam: The biggest.
Travis: Do you want to do that?
Sam: Let's try it.
Travis: Salt water or fresh water? Or wine.
Laura: Fresh water.
Taliesin: Fresh water.
Travis: I take out the Alchemy Jug and I say, fresh water.
Matt: It fills with fresh water to the surface.
Laura: Try breathing it.
Travis: Are we underwater right now?
Taliesin: We'll take it out of the water.
Travis: Okay. I stick my head in it. Can I breathe?
Matt: Yeah, fine.
Travis: It works. It works! I'm holding it above the water.
Laura: Oh, smart.
Liam: I hear you can do this with a non-magical jug, too.
Sam: Oh yeah. We just could have carried water in a jug.
Travis: Don't downplay my special moment.
Sam: We have chalices.
Laura: We do have an extra chalice. You know what? I'm going to take the fancy chalice and-- as needed.
Taliesin: I'm going to use the breathing jug.
Matt: This is the funnest work-around. I love it.
Sam: It's a water bong?
Matt: Essentially. You guys are gravity-bonging your way through an underwater volcano. If that's not Vox Machina, I don't know what is.
Taliesin: It's how I solve so many problems in my life. It's the solution to half our problems.
Liam: We're going to try to water-bong every combat scenario for the rest of the campaign.
Travis: I was looking at it, and I was like, fresh water, vinegar, oh!
Matt: All righty. So.
Sam: Don't do drugs, everyone.
Matt: As you guys make your way around the way, through the combination of that druid spell and, strangely, Grog's ingenuity, you guys have bypassed a fairly serious situation. You make it down around the curvature of the tunnel, to where that small lava jump is. Anybody who wants to make that leap, go ahead and make an athletics check, please.
Laura: I pop Scanlan on the broom and we fly on over.
Taliesin: I activated my boots and walk.
Marisha: And I use my mantle, which I constantly forget triples my jump distance.
Matt: It does, so go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: 21.
Marisha: That's not great. Acrobatics?
Matt: Athletics.
Marisha: Oh, that's better. That's better. 15.
Matt: 15? Yeah. You coast over. It's like a soft Neo jump. Not quite that far, but you coast and land onto the side. Grog, what did you get?
Travis: 21.
Matt: 21. You guys all make it across that little stretch of molten rock without an issue. You continue around the way. Vex and Vax, as you guys are making heavy footfalls and making some distance, you begin to feel this (rumbling noise) rumbling in the ground beneath you.
Liam: Oh shit.
Laura: I think there's something burrowing. Or an earthquake.
Marisha: Earth elementals.
Laura: Potentially.
Marisha: Volcanic earth elementals.
Liam: Everybody hold still for a moment.
Laura: I cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Dope.
Matt: I would like all of you to make a stealth check right now.
Travis: Oh, I think you barely got that in.
Matt: Barely.
Sam: It's plus ten?
Matt: Plus ten.
Sam: 31.
Taliesin: 34.
Marisha: 34.
Liam: 40!
Laura: Wow. 25.
Travis: I'm sorry, guys.
Taliesin: Oh no. Plus ten?
Travis: 16.
Sam: Oh, okay, that's above something.
Travis: I have a feeling.
Sam: What about Trinket?
Laura: Trinket's in the necklace.
Matt: The rumbling stops as you all quietly stand still. You begin to get bold, to take a few more very faint steps on the ground. The rumbling continues and gets louder and louder.
Laura: (whispers) I get my bow ready.
Matt: All right. I'm going to go to break.
Travis: Oh! You fucking didn't!
Matt: I'm hungry. All right. Yeah. So we'll pick up from that rumbling here at the end of the break. We'll see you guys back here in a moment. We have quite the giveaway today. We have a spalted tamarind complete dice tower system. Three pieces from our friends at Wyrmwood. This is actually, this is Percival's wood type. It's nice, with a leather interior from our friends at Wyrmwood. One lucky winner's going to get this. To enter this, find your way to the Twitch chat. And when requested during the break, go ahead and enter the word "volcano." That will put you in the entry. We'll come back with a winner in a minute. We're going to go ahead and have a quick break with some food, and we'll see you here in a minute, guys! [break]
Matt: And welcome back to Critical Role.
Travis: That was a barrage.
Matt: Yeah, that was making up for the beginning of the game. We have a winner. In the chat, we have johnny2x40 as the winner. Congratulations, johnny2x40. Danoba will contact you shortly to get your information, and we'll get that shipped out to you ASAP, signed by the cast. Congratulations.
Liam: The fuck was that?
Marisha: I loved it so much.
Taliesin: That's amazing.
Matt: All right. So as the rumbling continues to grow and swell, you all hold yourselves in place. (rumbling, crashing) You hear the crumbling and crashing of stone and rock, as from the side of the hallway, right next to where Grog is standing, maybe about a foot and a half in front of him, you watch some large, pointed object pierce through the wall, maybe about nine feet tall or so, go (explosion) out, sending dust and rock spilling out, and there's a faint orange glow from some smooth, armored head to some large creature with a toothy mouth that opens up and (chomping) as it bites down, you see rows and rows of teeth that are glowing orange, as bits of molten rock are spilling out the sides of the mouth.
Marisha: It's like 2006's The Core!
Matt: Yeah. I hope it's better than that. You recognize the shape of the front, especially you, Percival, as you spent some time with a creature of a similar shape.
Laura: Oh, is it a worm? A purple worm?
Matt: No, because it has two, big. muscular, trunk-like arms, as it (crash crash) out in front, but it has no eyes. It has the solid, armored front, and heated edges where the plates meet. It seems to be some sort of elemental-infused or variant of the bulette that you encountered before. And as it breaks through and stops, mere inches from Grog-- turn that thing off.
Liam: It talks! It's a sentient bulette!
Sam: Happy Birthday.
Matt: (snarls) Across the way, you hear a low rumble again. (snarls) It stomps the ground. And you watch, from one of the other walls, (explosion) jutting from it, a smaller version. And a second emerges. (explosion) Two children. They both emerge, going (snarls). As you're all standing there, holding perfectly still.
Sam: They can't see us. We'll stand still and we'll be fine, right?
Marisha: Jurassic Park rules.
Matt: (sniffs)
Laura: Oh no!
Liam: We could attack them.
Laura: There's three of them!
Matt: One of them turns around, and starts walking slowly towards the direction that Grog is. The large mother. And turns, Grog, and you have to lean back as the nose sweeps past, and is facing right in your direction. You can see these large holes in the front of its armored snout go (sniffing). The mouth slightly cracks open and curls back into what you could almost imagine to be a grin.
Travis: Can I quietly go into a rage? (laughter)
Taliesin: You are not my parents.
Matt: Well, as none of you have done anything at this point in time, I need you all to roll initiative.
Liam: See, that's what it was! That's what it was!
Travis: I heard you saying it, too.
Laura: You should have just done it!
Marisha: Do what?
Liam: Don't worry about it.
Laura: No!
Taliesin: Goddamnit. No.
Liam: Every time. Every time I do it!
Marisha: Oh, your sneak attack?
Liam: Yes. Fuckers.
Matt: So Grog, who was stopped here, was the last to leap. Keyleth made it all the way over here.
Laura: Trinket's in the necklace. We were on the broom.
Matt: Broom over here.
Marisha: Might still be able to do it.
Matt: Vax. Where were you? You were stealthed.
Liam: I was near the lead.
Matt: So you would be over here, stealthing behind this rock.
Sam: What a great board!
Laura: This is really cool. Oh god, it's huge! Grog! Little baby bulette.
Travis: It's huge.
Laura: Do we remember what its weaknesses were?
Marisha: I know it takes half damage, I think, to non-magical physical attacks. He's got heavily armored skin. Other than that, I don't know.
Sam: Ooh! Did a new light just pop on? And another light? For a red lava effect in my eyes?
Matt: Into your eyes, Sam. That's why I do this. All right, so initiative order. 25 to 20?
Laura: Oh, 20.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Liam: 17.
Travis: 19.
Sam: 18!
Laura: Does it realize that anybody but Grog is there?
Matt: You don't know.
Laura: We could have, potentially.
Matt: All right. And you're 17, you said?
Liam: 17.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Here we go. This is going to be fun.
Matt: All right. 15 to ten?
Marisha: 13.
Taliesin: 12. My lowest possible initiative.
Marisha: Did you roll a one?
Taliesin: I rolled a one.
Matt: All righty. So top of the round, as all of them seem to have shifted in the direction of Grog, who is now quietly raging. Vex, you're up first. What do you want to do?
Laura: Oh god. I'm going to try to hit it with a Lightning Arrow.
Matt: Which one?
Laura: What do you mean?
Travis: What animal?
Liam: There's the mama and two babies.
Laura: I'm going to try to hit the one that's breathing on Grog.
Matt: All righty. So go ahead and make your attacks.
Travis: Yeah, provoke the thing with its teeth closest to me. I'm just fucking with you.
Laura: But it knows you're there! Maybe it doesn't know I'm there! Plus I get a sneak attack on it, because you're right next to it.
Matt: It's true.
Laura: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark it!
Matt: Look at that!
Laura: (laughs) I say!
Matt: She says to you!
Laura: 25!
Matt: 25 hits.
Laura: Lovely. So if that was a 3rd-level Lightning Arrow, then that means I get 3d8 lightning damage in addition to my regular damage, or is it just 3d8 lightning damage? Wait. Roll the attack as normal, the target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit. Oh, and every creature within ten feet makes a dexterity saving throw. Okay. If I cast it at 4th-level, so no, it's just 3rd-level.
Matt: So it's 4d8 lightning damage. So you made the attack roll. It hit. So it takes that.
Laura: Wow. Really? Nine plus--
Matt: Grog, make a dexterity saving throw, please.
Travis: Thank you. I have advantage on those, but I won't need it because that was a 19.
Laura: 15. It doesn't actually do my regular arrow attack damage? It's just-- wow. My spells are useless compared to my regular attacks.
Travis: 21.
Laura: 15 damage.
Matt: All right. So 15 damage. And then 2d8 to Grog. Roll 2d8. And you take half that because you made your save.
Travis: 19. It's right on the paper. Negative two. Sorry.
Laura: You still made your save.
Matt: Yeah. What's the damage?
Laura: Five.
Matt: Five damage to you, Grog.
Travis: Thank you.
Matt: Five total, or that's halved?
Laura: That's five total.
Matt: All right, you take two points of lightning damage. Not too bad.
Laura: I'm going to try to hit it again, then.
Matt: Lightning Arrow-- well, no. Interesting point of order, Lightning Arrow is a bonus action.
Laura: Oh, and I did Hunter's Mark.
Matt: So no Hunter's Mark.
Laura: Oh, so I did Hunter's Mark-- no. Oh. I am never going to do spell attacks ever again. They're worthless for me.
Matt: So no Hunter's Mark, but you hit it with the Lightning Arrow. Next round you can worry about that.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: That's your first attack. You have your second attack.
Laura: Okay, then I'm going to attack it with a regular-ass arrow that does more damage, probably-- natural 20-- than a fucking Lightning Arrow.
Matt: You did not do your sneak attack damage last round, so if you wanted to do sneak attack damage on this, you can.
Laura: Okay. Lovely.
Matt: Which means you also double the sneak attack damage.
Laura: Sweet. That's seven. 14 plus eight is 22, 24, plus lightning damage. 24 plus five is 29 damage with a regular arrow.
Matt: And that's with the additional sneak attack?
Laura: Yes. No, I get two sneak attacks! Plus another four. 29 plus four. 33.
Marisha: Sneak attack that bitch!
Matt: 33 points of damage to it.
Travis: Do I take that, too?
Laura: No, that's regular.
Matt: As you release the Lightning Arrow, it slams into it. (growling) The look shoots in the direction where it came from, and as it opens up its snout to smell, you fire a second arrow into its mouth, and it starts writhing in place as it does. It shakes, and you feel the ground quake in the presence, and a few rocks (impacts) from the ceiling and the children join the wail, and they all turn in your direction. You going to do anything else on your turn?
Laura: Can I get on my broom?
Matt: Yeah, you get on your broom?
Laura: I get on my broom.
Matt: That's all you do? All righty! Grog, you're up.
Travis: Oh, I am, huh?
Matt: At the beginning of your turn, the heat emanating from this bulette that's right next to you is rather intense. You immediately suffer-- from proximity to its searing body-- 11 points of fire damage.
Laura: How much?
Marisha: 11 points. That's not bad, yeah.
Laura: Are these monsters or beasts?
Matt: These are considered monstrosities.
Travis: How tall is the area that we're standing in?
Matt: The top of the cavern would be about, maybe, ten feet. Ten to 12 feet.
Travis: Ten to 12 feet? Yeah, I'm going to make both of my attacks at Mama Bear. Yeah, because I've got to move. Either I move and it senses the non-stealthy-- yeah, fuck it, I'm just going to take both of my Bloodaxe attacks at it with the first one Great Weapon Master. Not reckless. 21?
Matt: 21 hits.
Travis: Just barely? Okay. That's awesome. 26... 36 points of damage?
Matt: 36 points of damage on that first hit? Not bad. The axe cracks into the side of its body, and you see the armor crack a little bit where it hits. You pull the axe free, you can see the blood pour out. As it spills and hits the ground, (sizzle) you can see the actual blood in their body is superheated as well.
Travis: Ooh, that's a problem. Okay. They're like xenomorphs. I'll take the second strike, as well. Great Weapon Master, not reckless.
Matt: Okay, not reckless.
Travis: That's shit. That's going to miss, I think. Yeah. 20?
Matt: 20 hits.
Travis: Oh, really?
Taliesin: We're learning, we're learning things.
Travis: 15. Because I said Great Weapon Master, it's minus five.
Matt: You did. That misses.
Taliesin: Somewhere between 15 and 20.
Matt: This is this one time where you do swing and it hits, but the angle of the axe blade hits the edge of its head plate armor, and scrapes off the top with a shower of sparks off to the side. No damage.
Travis: Can I use my bonus action to rage or not?
Matt: Well, yeah, you were beginning to quietly rage.
Travis: Fair enough. Ends my turn.
Laura: You want to move?
Travis: No! I'm right next to it.
Matt: Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: Boy, man. I don't know what these things can do. I will step forward a little bit. Super tanky.
Matt: Ten feet? Five feet?
Sam: That's good enough for now. No, keep going.
Laura: There's lava! Careful!
Sam: Thanks. I will inspire Grog by singing the customary birthday song of his people, which goes like this, (singing) Happy happy happy, happy happy happy-- they're a very simple people-- happy happy happy happy. (groans) (laughter)
Travis: You sang that better than my mother! Did I have a mom?
Sam: And then as practice, I'm going to become my beautiful angel self and transform into a naked planetar.
Marisha: Oh shit. Going planetar.
Sam: I assume I lose everything. I lose my Heroes' Feast--
Laura: Why would you?
Sam: Because I'm a different creature.
Laura: So? It's still in your blood.
Sam: I don't think so.
Marisha: Is this True Polymorph?
Sam: Yes.
Taliesin: Maybe you get it back when you turn back.
Marisha: Generally, it'll say. Because Shapechange, you absorb your armor.
Sam: Do you happen to have a planetar figurine?
Matt: That's what I'm checking. I thought I had one prepared.
Sam: Oh my god. Guys. Magic  the Gathering Puzzle Quest. Did I mention you can find out more at bit.ly/MagicRole?
Laura: You did, actually!
Sam: Capital M, capital R on that, by the way, guys. Visit it right now. Friends of the show. They need your support.
Laura: That's right.
Marisha: You know those first generation Black Lotus cards can go for $30,000, depending on their condition.
Taliesin: Is it the alpha style with the black border?
Marisha: Yep. Banned cards.
Sam: Matt is really looking for this thing. In the meantime, let me tell you some other amazing Magic: The Gathering cards. I've got Time Twister, Jace the Mind Sculptor--
Taliesin: I've actually performed the Jace the Mind Sculptor. It takes three friends to really pull it off.
Sam: Naked Singularity. Not a sexual position.
Matt: We'll say for the purposes of this, because it is the same size as a large creature, right?
Sam: It is.
Matt: We will use good old Doty as the current size of your planetar.
Liam: I can touch my miniature! Whoa!
Matt: You need to be there, because otherwise you'd be stepping in the lava.
Sam: Okay, thanks.
Matt: So that's it?
Sam: I think that's all I can do.
Matt: You can continue to move, if you want.
Sam: Oh, that's interesting. As that guy, can I move more?
Matt: Well, you've moved maybe 15 feet. I'd say you probably have, at his flying speed, maybe a third of his fly speed left.
Sam: That's another 40 feet.
Matt: (chuckles) So there is that.
Sam: All right. Well, then you guys got this well in hand. I'm going to fly to the other guy. Is he going to get an attack on me?
Matt: This guy here?
Sam: Yeah. As I fly up high?
Matt: You fly to him and you're gliding above right now.
Sam: No, I'm going to go to the furthest guy.
Matt: Over here? (gliding noises) Okay. You're currently floating above the lava. It's not affecting you as you (whoosh) fly by. Because you're flying, no, I will say the mom bulette does not notice you pass. It does not get an attack of opportunity.
Sam: (whispering) I'm the Crow.
Matt: Essentially. All right, that ends your turn. Vax.
Liam: Click the boots. Hunter's Mark on mama. So all that's left is dagger, dagger, dagger, so I'm going to do sharpshooter throws with the three daggers that are left.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Am I within 60 feet? I think I am. All right, so negative five on attacks. The first one is total shit. The second one is 17?
Matt: 17 does not hit. (dagger ricochets) Ricochets off.
Liam: 23 on the last.
Matt: That does hit.
Liam: Okay, because Grog is right there, it is sneak attack? (sighs) One, this is nine, plus that is ten, plus this. 13, 18, 24, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37. And because it was a sharpshooter attack, it's 47.
Matt: Oof. Nice. Great, so that one, seeing the glow of the slight crack in the armor that Grog had left, the dagger disappears inside the slight gap, and you see this (spurt) of super hot, thick, viscous blood spill out and hit the side of the rock and then cool and darken as it does across the side of the cavern wall.
Liam: And then for movement, watch this shit right here, folks. (counting) 40, because I'm hasted, 45, 50, 55.
Matt: There you go.
Sam: Wow.
Laura: Wow.
Liam: I did it my fucking self!
Matt: All right, that ends your turn?
Laura: Did it feel weird to have somebody else moving the people?
Matt: No, it felt awesome. I didn't have to do a damn thing. All right.
Liam: Oh, and Hunter's Mark!
Matt: Yes, the Hunter's Mark damage.
Liam: Six!
Matt: That's an additional six damage. All right, infuriated, it's now starting to stomp in the middle, and as it's hitting, the lava's starting to splash up around it. The babies! This one right here is only going to make a bite attack right now. It can't make a leap because you're too close to it. But as you rush towards it, it seems to sense your presence, and the movement of the wings (wing flap) keeping you aloft. And the baby's going to (snapping) and lash out towards you. That is 18.
Sam: Does not hit.
Matt: Does not hit. As it snaps out towards you, its saliva seeming to spray superheated liquid (saliva spray) across. Does not attack you at all. (laughter)
Taliesin: Well that got GIF'ed.
Liam: Dr. Manhattan, in the house!
Matt: The other baby watches you go running past. It's going to go ahead and make a Deadly Leap. 15 (landing) on you. (whoosh) That brings it here.
Laura: Oh shit!
Liam: He's dead.
Matt: If that was the case, half you guys would've been dead a long time ago. All right, I need you to make a strength or dexterity saving throw, your choice.
Liam: I'll do dexterity at advantage because of the boots, so that is a 27.
Matt: 27, okay. So you're not knocked prone, but you do take-- let's see here. 19 points of damage, bludgeoning and slashing. You are pushed five feet out of its space.
Liam: What was the total on that, Matt?
Laura: 19.
Matt: All righty. That's the two babies' turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. The battlefield changed a little bit, so instead, can I do a Chain Lightning out of the staff and hit all three of those motherfuckers? Starting with the big mama and branching off to the two other dudes?
Matt: I could say you could do that, yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I do that.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: That's 10d8. And it's a dex? I think it's a dexterity saving throw, and it's 10d8. One, two, three, four, five. Does anyone want to lend me their d8s?
Laura: How many? I've got five here.
Marisha: You have five there? Okay, okay, okay. A little Ashley Johnson "Okay, okay, okay."
Liam: (imitating Ashley) Yeah!
Marisha: (imitating Ashley) Yeah!
Matt: Nope, nope, and nope. No one makes their save. This big, hulking thing.
Marisha: Okay, I get to reroll ones because I'm a badass.
Liam: You got a bunch, too.
Marisha: Yes, I did.
Marisha: No, that's a ten. Ooh, that's good. Okay, okay, five, four and four is eight, so that brings us to 13, another-- wait, four and four and eight--
Laura: 17.
Marisha: That was right, right?
Laura: Yes, so you're at 17 now.
Marisha: 17 plus another four is 21, plus another five is 26, plus another four is 30, plus another six is 36, plus another 16 total. So 36 plus 16 is 52.
Matt: 52 points of damage?
Laura: You've got another one here.
Marisha: Oh, 52 plus another seven, so 59.
Matt: 59 damage against all three of them. So as you stand in the middle and watch one of them leap past and pounce onto your lover as he's pushed out of the way, you see Grog now facing off with this giant gnashing mouth that is spilling forth super-hot liquid, the lava glowing in the distance. You're having flashbacks to the last time you dealt with lava. You concentrate for a second and release the blast of energy as it arcs off, (explosions) slamming into each of them. You see them shake and quiver, their muscles tensing as they shriek in the middle of the cavern. (shrieks) They stagger backward. Hurt, but seemingly still holding on. All right, Percy, your turn.
Taliesin: I'm going to activate Silence. So that's up. Charge Diplomacy. I'm going to give it a little rev with my bonus action, and I'm going to-- oh wow, can I actually reach? I can't quite reach, but I can get close. I'm going to head against that wall and start climbing up that wall.
Laura: Right here?
Taliesin: Yeah, up there. Just put me up there. Yeah, there we go.
Matt: Okay. Is that all you're going to do with your turn?
Taliesin: That's my action, my bonus action, and my movement.
Matt: All right, that's your turn. All right, now it's the mama bulette's turn. Mama bulette has been facing Grog this whole time, after taking the dagger and watching you run past, seeming ready to leap, but with you still right in front of it, she'll attack you. That is a natural 18. This is important. So that's a total of 31 to hit.
Travis: Let me check-- yeah.
Matt: So that's 45 points of piercing damage, halved. We'll say 22, plus 13 points of fire damage... and you are swallowed. On an attack roll of an 18 to 20, it swallows the target. And literally, I rolled a natural 18.
Taliesin: What happens if you--
Travis: It's always me! (laughing) It's always me.
Matt: Apparently, man.
Taliesin: What happens if you Titanstone-- never mind. I'm going to find out.
Travis: We've done this before. I'm well-versed.
Matt: You are blinded and restrained, currently.
Travis: Blinded and restrained.
Matt: It now begins to (thudding) go right up into melee range with Keyleth, who blasted it with the Chain Lightning before. That brings us to the top of the round. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to Hunter's Mark it! And then I'm going to attack it with an arrow.
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: (old woman voice) Bramble Shot!
Matt: How'd that go again?
Laura: (old woman voice) Bramble Shot! (normal voice) 25! Oh! Can I do sharpshooter and do minus five to hit, plus ten to attack?
Matt: Generally, you have to decide that before you roll your attack. You can't just add it on like, oh, I rolled well! I'll say no, not for that first attack. You can for your second.
Laura: This one is a Bramble Shot and it's a 25 to hit.
Matt: That does hit.
Laura: Okay, cool. Five plus eight is 13, 14, 15. 15 plus sneak attack and lightning damage. 15, 19, 23, 25, and then 4d8 piercing damage. 32.
Matt: All right. 32 points.
Laura: And then he has to make a strength saving throw.
Matt: That is a 20.
Laura: Then he succeeds.
Matt: As the arrow slams into the side, the brambles reach around, and you watch as these thorny vines that wrap around the body begin to blacken and burst into flame. By the proximity, the brambles begin to burn to cinders and then break off the body as it storms forward.
Laura: I attack him again. This time I'm going to try as a sharpshooter!
Matt: Do it!
Laura: Okay!
Matt: You're up next, Grog.
Laura: Natural 20!
Matt: Holy shit! That'll hit.
Laura: And it's a Bramble Shot. Do I have to say that before, too? Motherfucker.
Matt: Well, Bramble Shot gets to see if it hits or not. It's not lost if you missed. If you hit, you can say Bramble Shot.
Laura: So yeah!
Matt: Same way that Divine Smite can be done.
Laura: Okay, cool! All right! Right. I'm going to roll all my dice, and then double that, then add my extra things. How about that?
Matt: Do that. That's usually how you're supposed to do it.
Laura: All right, Matt. Okay, so 11, 14, 20, 23, 25, 50. That's easy. 58, 60.
Matt: 60 points of damage with one shot! And secondary saving throw.
Laura: Oh, plus ten because it was sharpshooter. 70!
Matt: 70 points of damage with a single arrow! You didn't add your sneak attack damage a second time, did you? Okay, good. That is nasty. It rolled a natural 16 plus six for its strength saving throw, so it's not affected by the bramble. However, it is looking rough. The second arrow hits the side and you watch as it streaks, pieces of the armor fall off to the side. You can see the striations of its muscle, and where the muscle tissue is, it's dark, but at the seams it's glowing orange.
Laura: I didn't add the Hunter's Mark damage. Well, only extra two damage for that.
Matt: There you go, extra two damage. But now it's bleeding everywhere. Wherever it's walking, you can see it thrashing about. It's spilling off this heated liquid that's pouring out of its wounds. Does that end your turn?
Laura: No, I'm going to move on my broom so he doesn't know I'm there. I'm going to fly to here.
Matt: Okay! That ends your turn. Grog, you're up. First things first, at the start of your turn, because you are swallowed by the mom, you suffer 42 points of fire damage. Oh, it has to make a constitution saving throw to see if it spits him up first, actually, because you did more than 40 points of damage. That is a 22. Yeah, it's fine. Wait, no, it's 25 DC. No, it does not! You do not take the damage because she did enough damage with that crit hit arrow that it vomits you up. You are prone.
Laura: Happy birthday!
Travis: Thank you!
Matt: That would have been a good 42 points of damage.
Marisha: Grog gets vomited up in front of me?
Matt: Yep! (sizzling) There's steam.
Travis: Every fucking time. Hi!
Marisha: You smell like shit.
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.
Travis: I'd like to stand up.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Jump into its throat.
Taliesin: Jump back in.
Travis: I would like to smash my Titanstone Knuckles together and cast Enlarge on myself. Gotta get some fire resistance because good god.
Marisha: Big Grog!
Laura: Whoa, what is that?
Marisha: He's swole.
Laura: I don't think we've seen this.
Matt: That's been it every time.
Travis: Yeah, every time.
Laura: But we haven't seen it! Haven't seen it up close. Oh, Grog is scary as fuck! I'm sorry; you're scary! Okay.
Travis: Can I do reckless, Great Weapon Master?
Matt: Yes, you may.
Taliesin: That's something Travis would say.
Laura: Put me down?
Taliesin: It's something Travis would say.
Travis: 26?
Matt: Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Nice. 37 on the first.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: (singing) Happy happy (war cry).
Taliesin: Happy birthday.
Matt: After it finishes vomiting you up and you get off the ground, still feeling the sizzling of its salivary liquid on your body, you sing this song to yourself as it rights itself. Its mouth opens once more. You bring the axe down right above its head. You crack the center of its armored plate. The top of its head caves in and you watch as the eyes go dull and the body collapses and falls to the ground, unmoving. Its body is still there, though, because it's very big. It only loses about two feet of height as it collapses, and it's still blocking a large portion of that hallway right now. That's your first hit. You still have half of your movement, still, because you used half of it to get up from prone.
Travis: Should I try and push him out of the way?
Laura: Just vault over it.
Travis: Yep, I'm going to (leaping noise) over the side, hardcore parkour. One-handed.
Sam: Duke boys, sliding over the hood of the car?
Matt: Using your boots, or just making an athletics check as part of your movement?
Travis: Yeah, let's use the Boots of Feral Leaping.
Matt: Go ahead and make your athletics check.
Travis: That's going to be a 26. 27. Towards you. Towards his left. Yep. And I'll move up.
Matt: You have 25 more feet.
Travis: I do, don't I?
Matt: You can use your piece. Look at that!
Travis: Can I get around here on the ground?
Matt: Yeah, you could. You can make an acrobatics check to see if you can avoid the lava as you do that.
Travis: Yeah, I want to!
Matt: All right, make an acrobatics, not athletics.
Travis: Acrobatics. 16.
Matt: 16? You just barely make it around that corner, curling around. Yeah, you don't go foot-first in the lava, like somebody else did earlier.
Marisha: I'm picturing Grog being like (intense grunting, careful inching, intense grunting).
Matt: That's about where you can get to.
Travis: I'm right there, yeah.
Matt: That's the end of your turn, Grog. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: As my holy self, imbued with the holy power of whatever I am, I float up a bit, draw my greatsword that I always use to attack because I'm awesome and bring it down real hard on the head of the thing.
Matt: Go ahead and roll for an attack.
Laura: Are you naked with a sword hanging from your hip?
Liam: He's hitting it with his dick.
Sam: No, I'm naked with a sword. I've got a belt. I'm naked with a belt.
Marisha: He's Mr. November.
Sam: That is 21.
Matt: 21 hits. The babies don't have quite as hard armor. As you bring the greatsword down, you strike with a large swipe of bright, divine radiant energy. As it slams into the top of its head, it explodes with radiant power.
Sam: Do I roll, or do I use these stats?
Matt: You roll damage. The stats are for me. 4d6 plus seven slashing.
Sam: Seven, 12, 18 plus seven is 25. Plus I need 5d8.
Marisha: Oh yeah! Use mine! They just did very good.
Matt: Yeah, dude. Planetar form isn't messing around.
Laura: He didn't shake them, you just put them on down. That was the shadiest roll ever. If you did that in Vegas, they'd be like, "No."
Travis: The pit boss over here disapproves.
Sam: Plus 14. So that's 39, right?
Matt: 39, yes.
Sam: On my first attack.
Matt: So first off, I forgot earlier. Grog, you did take another seven points of fire damage from being in the proximity of the corpse, which is still emanating heat, by the way.
Travis: Halved, because I have resistance from the enlargement now.
Matt: Correct. Well, at the top of your turn, you got that, because you did not enlarge inside. And you also, as your planetar form, did take ten points of fire damage in your proximity to that one there, as well, so mark that. However, you, with that first strike, slam down and cleave the head in half. You watch as the baby's head (gravelly shriek). It had taken 49 damage before from her Chain Lightning. So with that second hit, (whack) it (gurgles) and falls to the ground, no longer moving. There is only one currently living child on the battlefield.
Sam: All right. Well, then I'll say a silent prayer for the fallen and then fly backwards super fast to the other one (whoosh) and attack again!
Laura: Maybe you can make it a pet.
Sam: Oh. 18.
Matt: 18 still hits.
Sam: Hey! All right. Look at all these crazy things. 12 plus-- that's not very good. 12 plus all those.
Matt: That was 12 plus seven?
Sam: That's right. 19.
Matt: So 19 damage.
Sam: (counting) 19. Whatever I just said. Is that 19 plus 19?
Matt: 19 plus 19.
Sam: 34?
Matt: 38 damage. That kills it, yeah. So you hack one down, dart across the way with your blade screaming in the air. It actually cuts through the rock as it sparks across the ceiling. With what little space you have, your wings open, slam down on the second child and watch as its armored body cracks open. The radiant blast expands and bursts when the blade is actually dug a few inches into its form, causing you to destroy it from the inside of its armored shell. You watch as its body inflates for a second, then falls limp as smoke begins to pour from its wounds. So with that, you guys have wiped out the current danger on the battlefield.
Sam: I feel like there's more coming.
Laura: No, that was it.
Travis: We're just traumatized.
Laura: The Core Anvil is going to float up from the magma.
Marisha: It's so hot.
Taliesin: That's a complicated tray. (laughter)
Travis: As he herniates a disc.
Matt: Yeah. I pulled my leg earlier this week, so moving up and down sucks. So as you sit there in the silence there for a moment, just hearing the occasional (plopping) with the nearby lava that fills the nearby hallway, you don't feel any further rumbling. There's just the heat emanating from the corpses of these three magma bullettes. What do you do?
Travis: Can I look around for anything that resembles an anvil or a shelf or something that one might wackadoodle on?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Nice. Watch me knock this out of the park.
Matt: I'd say more of a perception check for this. This is less of searching for details.
Travis: That's better. Still shitty. 11.
Matt: The pathway still continues to descend and curve around, but that's it.
Travis: The pathway still continues to descend around.
Laura: Wow. Very observant of you, Grog.
Marisha: Descended around.
Travis: What?
Marisha: Copy that.
Laura: Can we see now because of all the glow coming from-- does magma glow?
Matt: Most of you, aside from Percival, can see decently in low light, anyway, or have darkvision.
Taliesin: It's only been about 25 seconds, but we do eventually have to breathe.
Laura: Oh. I'll use my chalice.
Marisha: Oh yeah. Pass the jug.
Sam: What about me?
Matt: You, as a planetar, let's see here.
Sam: I think I'm dying.
Laura: What? Why?
Sam: I don't know. I think I probably need air.
Matt: Well, you have a pretty high con bonus. You could hold your breath for seven minutes.
Sam: I'll do that. See how I fare.
Laura: Do you still have Heroes' Feast?
Sam: No.
Marisha: No, you do.
Sam: I don't think I do. I'm a new body.
Marisha: No. True Polymorph, you absorb your gear and you don't benefit from it, but it doesn't say anything about you not benefiting from--
Matt: Previous spells and bonuses. That's an interesting point.
Taliesin: The soul is imbued with Heroes' Feast, not the body.
Marisha: Correct.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Interesting.
Taliesin: See, it's all there. (laughter)
Liam: But we're along the path to the water that I saw.
Marisha: The gear melds into the new form. The creature cannot activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment, but it doesn't say anything else other than equipment.
Sam: Thank you, Lindsay Lohan.
Marisha: You're very welcome.
Matt: I'll allow it.
Sam: I still can't breathe.
Matt: You still have the same effect earlier that she put on you, so you still have the water breathing.
Sam: Oh! So I can breathe some water. All right, cool.
Matt: You're flying in here with the small space you have. Being a large creature, the fact that you even flew across-- you were only a few inches off the ground as you darted over. It's only about ten to 12 feet, and you're maybe nine feet tall.
Laura: You're 12 feet tall, so you're hitting the ceiling?
Taliesin: I'm going to start peering around the corner with the flashlight.
Liam: We're under two minutes away from the water I previously made it up to and didn't go into, correct?
Matt: Correct. You're maybe 40 seconds away from it.
Taliesin: I'm going to head that way.
Matt: You guys dart around the corner and follow the next pool. You have your means of passing water around, keeping yourselves viable. The path continues to curve in a haphazard spiral. It curves around and you watch as it passes, evens out, and then goes into a fairly steep decline, a 45-degree decline.
Laura: Should I try flying down there with the broom?
Liam: We're 30 seconds away from the water. I've already gone this way and come back to you guys. Unless something has jumped in the hole while I was gone in that time, I've already covered this ground.
Matt: This is further than you covered. There's the pool of water you saw, and if you continue around that way, you can see it curve as you glance around and it descends in a steady decline.
Taliesin: The pool of water is just a pool of water.
Matt: It's a small, little pit.
Laura: I'm going to recast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, P.S.
Taliesin: I can follow you down there, too, because I've got my boots on.
Marisha: Do the two twins want to scout?
Matt: The pool of water, by the way, as you glance down and look past the surface, it does have a cylindrical tube that is feeding the liquid into it, but it's much smaller. It gets to that big of a pinching point before it vanishes out of sight.
Liam: Of your hands?
Matt: Of the pool. Continuing down the path of the tunnel, as it curves around and goes into the decline, it continues and maintains its width of about 15 to 20 feet on either side. You glance down the decline, and there's a portion of the ground that opens up and glowing molten rock slowly drips and dribbles down for about 40 or 50 feet.
Sam: I'm going to cast Detect Evil and then wordlessly speak to you all.
Laura: Oh, in our brains? I like it.
Sam: I say  Brothers and sisters. Allow me to guide us by the spirits of my religious faith down into the depths of this hell place.
Liam: While he's talking, I turn to my sister and go--
Laura: Are you still you, Scanlan, just in another body?
Sam: Yes, my child. Inside.
Travis: Boners and wangs.
Laura: It's weird that you're nine feet tall, but your penis is still a cube.
Sam: That's by choice. (laughter)
Sam: So you can recognize me if I die in a fight and you have to go to a lab and identify the body, you'll be like (fake crying) oh, it's him!
Liam: And they shall know him by his cube.
Laura: Sorry. Yes. Lead the way.
Matt: You glide down your own way. The air is extremely warm as it passes by you. Holding your breath at this point, because you are not near any source of water, it looks like, and you're not carrying one with you. You glide down, rapid speed past the lava, which eventually comes and cools in a clump, a small mound where it seems a recent hole punched out of and began to dribble down. It's been cooling and causing this extra layer on the tunnel. Everything here seems to be in this weird state of flux. You continue past it, and it drops into a tunnel below, maybe about 20 or 30 feet wide. Descends downward.
Sam: Straight down?
Matt: Straight down.
Sam: I'll go down a bit.
Matt: You descend about 30 or 40 feet. This cylinder-like tunnel comes to a halt; it stops.
Sam: Am I detecting any evil?
Matt: You are not detecting any evil, no. Do you have darkvision in this form?
Sam: I don't know! Where does it say?
Matt: It says truesight. You don't have darkvision; you have everything vision.
Taliesin: Predator vision.
Sam: I can also speak every language!
Matt: Given that case, as soon as you land, you look up and you can see across the rock here, there is one portion of the wall that is smoother than the rest in a concave perfect square across the opposite side. You can see faint runes or glyphs that are pressed into the stone, like part of it has been untouched for quite some time.
Sam: Is there writing or is it just symbols?
Matt: Because you can read any language, right?
Sam: It says languages  all.
Matt: Yeah. Okay.
Taliesin: This is the most irritated I've ever seen Matt.
Liam: This is because of the planetar, not Ioun? Planetar. This is how you must stay always.
Sam: I agree.
Matt: Glancing at the glyphs here, there are roots of magical, arcane glyphs here, but whatever enchantment there was here is very faint. It's more about the message or image that is set here. It is an exit seal. It is a final word of those that utilized the space within. It translates to, "Here the Crafter's Halls lay dark, the means of making the World Ender gone. Allhammer protect us all."
Sam: Allhammer. Wow. I don't know.
Matt: The Allhammer. Make a religion check.
Laura: The Allhammer was--
Travis: You're not there.
Sam: Looking. Religion. I don't know. 11 plus I don't know.
Matt: Recalling that information, you have this information in your mind, I'll say. As long as you didn't roll a one.
Liam: You don't remember it, but you remember it.
Matt: The Allhammer is one of the prime gods of family, craft, and construction of fine, important things. It is the patron saint of all craftsmen, blacksmiths, forgemasters, artisans, and from the information you received from Ioun, the creator of and last user of the Core Anvil.
Marisha: So is it "the Allhammer lies beyond"? "Is dark"?
Matt: It was an exit phrase placed on this door by the last person who was in this.
Marisha: Here the Crafter's Hall remains dark, the Allhammer--
Laura: Watch over us.
Marisha: Watch over us. Something about watching over us. Yeah, validate free parking.
Taliesin: Objects in hammer are closer than they appear.
Sam: I'll fly back and report to the rest in my pristine body. My pristine, hairless body. And that is what I saw.
Laura: That was all in our heads?
Sam: Yes.
Travis: I think that's what we're looking for, right?
Laura: Yeah, let's go.
Liam: It was a flight down, yeah?
Sam: Hold on one second. (blowing water bubbles) (laughter)
Sam: I'm back to being pristine.
Matt: Just so everyone here understands, imagine between most conversations, there's somebody doing that into a small jar of water.
Sam: (blowing water bubbles) And it's all cloudy now from everybody.
Laura: How often can you re-up that jar? Oh god, it's nasty water.
Liam: You're motorboating a gravy bowl.
Sam: It's like a horse trough. There's hair.
Matt: It is getting a little thick. (laughter)
Matt: Oh god.
Laura: Should we head down there? Did it seem like you could pass through that door?
Sam: Oh, I didn't try the door.
Laura: You didn't try to get through it?
Sam: Sorry!
Laura: It's all right. We can find a way. It's just a door.
Sam: It's just a door; we'll be fine.
Travis: Yeah, we're great entering doors. Great history with doors. Let's go.
Matt: Who's doing what to get down there?
Taliesin: I'm walking down there.
Matt: You (footsteps) on the side.
Laura: I am flying down with the broom. Does anybody else need to ride? Do you need to bamf your wings out, or do you want to get on the broom?
Liam: I'm going to save those. I'll get on the broom. You're offering me a ride on the broom!
Travis: I've got the carpet.
Marisha: I'll take the carpet or whatever.
Matt: Grog and Keyleth on the carpet. You two on the broom. You flying. We're good. The rest of you guys descend down at a 45-degree grade and make it past where the lava stopped and cooled and collected and thickened up. Eventually, you find the area where it drops off into darkness below in this cylindrical tunnel. You make it down the 30 or so feet to where it stops. It takes you a moment, based on where Scanlan points you towards, but you can make out the runes he was mentioning. Percy, you're the only one who can read them.
Taliesin: More of that. All right.
Marisha: What? What does it say?
Taliesin: It's a "shop's closed," I suppose.
Laura: Can we reopen it?
Matt: No indicator of that. It was essentially, (door click) "Key is locked up forever. Bye! Bless this seal."
Laura: Bust through this shit or undo it? Do we have a way to cancel the seal out?
Marisha: So it's quite literally a family business. We're closed, retired. Bars in front of it.
Matt: You get that sense. The forge was made by and for the use of the Allhammer, and the Allhammer is locked somewhere on his own plane across the other side of the Divine Gate and has been for 800 years.
Liam: We've got a god-made doorway in front of us. Something-made door, right. Natural rock around it or is everything carved?
Matt: Natural volcanic rock. It's that same crumbly, porous black stone.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the doors.
Matt: It feels like the rest of the surrounding stone.
Taliesin: There's no obvious mechanism for opening it?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Laura: Can I pray to Pelor?
Taliesin: That's awful. No. Six.
Matt: No current sign of anything.
Taliesin: Anytime I look for anything worthwhile, I stare at rock going, huh! Found a rock.
Laura: I'm going to pray to Pelor. I don't know if it makes a difference.
Matt: What are you going to say?
Laura: I'm going to say  well. We are here at a doorway. I don't know if you speak to the Allhammer, if you know anything about this, but if you have any way to help us get through this, now would be the time. Trying to do good work here for you and all of mankind.
Travis: What about your bean?
Laura: Oh yeah. Well, I'm going to take the bean out and say all that shit again with the bean in between my hands. I'm going to whisper it to the bean because it's part of him.
Marisha: Can you hear the ocean?
Matt: Ocean bean. Putting the words and thoughts out there. Prayer is still a foreign thing to you that you're still learning to do.
Laura: That's why it was so good.
Matt: There's no words that respond, but you do get a warm sense pushing you forward. You get the idea from whatever guidance Pelor is sending your direction that you can translate from your only recently somewhat-faithful heart that you're on the right path. That's as much as you can muster from the conversation.
Laura: Thanks.
Travis: I don't want to jump the gun, but I did punch a volcano today. This door, probably not too big a tuna for me to filet, you know what I mean? Unless the runes say, "If you punch, melt you will."
Sam: It didn't say anything like that.
Travis: It didn't?
Marisha: It seems like it's just closed.
Laura: Are they glowing runes? Are they magical runes? Do they seem like they're magic?
Matt: This is an interesting point I should have recalled. Grog, are you still in your large form or not?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: How did you use the magic carpet to get across? That carpet will not carry you in your large form.
Travis: Oh, good point.
Laura: You're little. Or you could have--
Taliesin: Just slid down.
Laura: Oh yeah, could you have stretched to either side and he does a Ninja Warrior shit down the tube?
Travis: Well, we don't know how wide. How wide?
Laura: Well, that's what I mean.
Matt: The passageway heading downward would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of between 15 to 20 feet.
Laura: What about a Wonder Woman situation where you (impacts). Because you got the siege gauntlets on? And you make handholds?
Liam: How long a drop was it?
Matt: Well, the drop wasn't the issue. It was the 40 feet of lava that was curling down.
Travis: You could fly down and put me in the necklace, if you want.
Laura: Yeah, sure, that's what I did. Popped Trinket out, flew back up, grabbed Grog, came back down.
Matt: From a logistical standpoint, I recalled that.
Travis: Good call.
Matt: Okay, so what are you guys going to do?
Taliesin: Are the runes glowing? Are the runes not glowing?
Matt: No, the runes aren't glowing. You get the sense, Scanlan, that it was less that they were glowing, more that your truesight revealed the presence--
Sam: To me, everything is glowing a little bit.
Matt: You are a little Neo in the Matrix in this new physical form.
Taliesin: Tommy Wiseau is what I'm getting from this. I'm going to take the Sun Stone out of its little container, and really light up the room, and just illuminate the whole room now.
Laura: Is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Thank you, somebody.
Laura: 18.
Liam: 22.
Matt: 22. Glancing about, with the help of his light, as well, you look and you can see most of the rock is jagged and broken in places, and as you feel the edges, some parts flake off relatively easy, and when you get to the section of where that rectangular piece of the wall is that the glyphs are put across, it looks like it's a little smoothed over, like someone smoothed it down to make this intentional seal, but there's no sign of any sort of keyhole or handle or anything.
Laura: Maybe you could push it?
Travis: Let's try being polite, first. I will knock on the door.
Matt: It's heavy stone.
Travis: All right, fuck this. I try and push the door either in and to either side.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Go Strongjaw, go!
Laura: Go Strongjaw, go!
Marisha: Go Strongjaw, go!
Travis: 17.
Sam: You're inspired.
Travis: Oh yeah, I'll use that shit.
Matt: It's a d12.
Travis: Oh, it is? Oh shit. Awesome. 26.
Matt: 26! You jam your hands into the wall and push. As you push and shove, your fingers are grinding and breaking the actual stone until they feel something metal. It goes from crumbling stone to a metallic surface, and as you pull your hands back a little bit, you pull away these giant chunks of volcanic stone, the actual runes and glyphs breaking around your grasp, and you can look inside and see hammered, dark metal on the other side. You then put your hand in and shove as hard as you can, and with a very faint grinding, you feel it give about an inch, then another inch. And then eventually, it gives out suddenly, and you watch as suddenly the entire square structure falls inward with a slamming echo sound that echoes again and again, down a stairway that disappears from view about 20 feet ahead of you.
Laura: Check for traps!
Travis: You got it. Natural 20. (laughter)
Travis: That's not my thing.
Matt: Natural 20 doesn't mean you succeed, necessarily.
Liam: 18 for me.
Matt: All right. Both of you glance throughout the initial--
Liam: Grog, what do your elven eyes see?
Matt: -- steps into the hallway, which is now littered with broken rock for the first ten feet or so, with a platform where the large rectangular metal structure fell over. No signs of any traps, no signs of any tweaking with the floor or walls for any triggers. You do notice that the metal surfaces here are a texture of rough, hammered metal. You can see the series of small indentations, like all these have been hammered into place, and it looks like the seams where these large metallic wall slabs would be have a thin little placed bar over those, as well. You've gone from central volcano, natural, emerging and expanding rock and lava to a place of very intense, intended construct.
Travis: I feel like this is it.
Laura: Would my greedy eyes know what kind of metal it is?
Matt: Make an intelligence check.
Sam: It's all pewter. Pewter everywhere.
Laura: Intelligence. Investigation?
Matt: Well, this would be just an intelligence check. Just a straight modifier.
Laura: (laughs) Oh! Ten.
Matt: Ten? (sighs) You're not entirely certain of the metal. It is a dark, dull, slate gray. A little darker than that, even, and elements of the edges appear to be almost red. Almost like a rust or ruddy color, but you don't recognize what type of metal it is, necessarily.
Liam: I'm stealthing. I'm stealthing down the steps.
Laura: I did cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us again a while ago. I said it. I even marked it off after the fight.
Matt: Okay. You rolled a natural 20?
Liam: Yep. Using a Luck. But yeah.
Matt: Using Luck. You've used three Lucks today.
Liam: Three of my four, according to your campaign guide?
Matt: The campaign guide was something that was for other people to use... (laughter)
Matt: As sort of an inside joke for the previous more than three Lucks.
Liam: Well, that was my third, not my fourth.
Matt: Right, I'm saying for the purposes of the guide being released and you embracing your fate-touched nature and the extremely dutiful adherence to the law of your Raven Queen... sure, I'll give you a fate-touched additional fourth Luck.
Marisha: He's throwing you a bone.
Sam: You know why? Because he knows Liam bought the book.
Liam: I did buy the book. I bought the book in the first hour.
Sam: I bought the book, too. What do I get?
Matt: You get an awesome angel dick. (laughter)
Laura: Your one-inch cube suddenly grows.
Liam: To two inches!
Matt: Angel wang, by the way, is a good band name.
Travis: (singing) Angel wang.
Matt: All right.
Sam: I'm going to fly over to Vex and wordlessly say to her, be honest. Do you think I'm more handsome like this or as normal Scanlan?
Laura: I'm going to think in my head, Scanlan's the best.
Sam: Be aware that as a divine being, I can sense any lie. (laughter)
Laura: Scanlan, darling. You're fucking hot right now, all right? But I love you like you were. You're always my favorite when you're just yourself.
Sam: All right. Thank you. I turn my little naked butt to her and fly away. (laughter)
Matt: All right. So, this hallway that you guys have pushed through now, it's about 20 feet wide, 30 feet tall, and this long ceiling gradually curves to an apex point, like two adjoining sides of a roof. And it continues to progress forward, and then descends with the staircase.
Travis: Are the walls hot to the touch, since they're metal?
Matt: You put your hand out and feel it, and yes, they are. Not like (sizzle), but your hand can rest for a few seconds before you have to remove it. They're very hot.
Travis: We progress forward into the room down the stairs. Wherever the stairs lead.
Matt: All right, so. You leading?
Liam: Yeah, I'm 60 feet ahead with my 47 stealth right now.
Matt: Right. Okay. So as you begin, first thing you notice, the steps? They're long steps. They are about three feet wide each step.
Liam: God-sized.
Matt: So you're having to like, step, step, step, leap down a few feet, continue again, leap down a few feet, and each of you are doing this. Who here does not have magic boots?
Marisha: Me.
Laura: I mean, just part of my armor. If that's not boots, then it's probably just the front guards, huh.
Sam: I don't.
Matt: You're flying. You're fine.
Laura: But I've got my broom. That I just said I was on.
Matt: Correct. So you're fine. You, as you're walking, the ground is very hot, and you can continue to move your feet in a way where it's not too bad, but you get the sense if you were wearing normal boots and not the usual Ashari-made, leather setup that you work on, they would probably be melting across the metal floor here.
Laura: You want to hop up on this broom?
Marisha: Oh, I'm just-- big strides. Big strides!
Laura: All right. It looks awkward, but stay there, if you'd rather.
Marisha: I try to look more normal while still taking big strides.
Travis: It's not working.
Marisha: No?
Matt: All right, so. The air itself now smells of very caustic fumes mixed with the smell of burning coal, but there is oxygen now in this chamber. You can breathe. There's enough air to actually get a lungful here and there, though it is still thin, and there is still the toxic fume here that had you not had the Heroes' Feast, you'd be having a rough time. But you're not having to constantly dip into the jug anymore.
Travis: Did one of y'all growl just now? That was you?
Taliesin: That was me.
Travis: Or did it come out of the speaker?
Liam: You don't know.
Travis: That shit scared me. (laughter)
Travis: That shit was too loud from a weird direction. I got all haunted house for a second. I was like, (gasps).
Matt: I cannot wait to get to Halloween Horror Nights with you again.
Liam: Travis Willingham's fatal flaw.
Travis: I'm quick as hell. (laughs)
Matt: You are quick. That's why we leave you ten feet ahead of us.
Taliesin: You are the best jump scare.
Marisha: One of these days you're going to break someone's nose.
Travis: I know. Ah! I'm so sorry! (laughter)
Matt: It's going to be glorious. Anyway, as you descend the staircase, you ahead, make a perception check.
Liam: All right. I'm going to use your Pelor die. Hey, that's good. Perception, you say? 27!
Matt: 27, okay. You continue down for about two minutes or so, and even glancing ahead to the edge of your visual range here in the darkness, because there is no light source below at this point... the stairs are continuing and continuing and continuing, and you have no idea how long it'll go for, but you begin to sense as you're walking, and you hear this faint rhythmic, bassy rumble of a low, nearly inaudible, drum-like beat, deeper than any sound you've heard, quaking the ground ever so faintly. (slow, rumbling pulses) And you can very faintly feel it. You get down and move your fingers to the ground, and for the moments before the heat gets there, the next time you hear it, you can feel a very faint vibration, only because you are very perceptive at the moment.
Liam: Is it exactly rhythmic? Precisely?
Matt: I'd say, with your high perception check, you can tell that yes, it is precisely rhythmic.
Liam: I think there's some sort of god-sized machinery ahead of us. I think we're getting close.
Laura: Did you lose your earring because you're an angel now?
Travis: No, he keeps all his stuff.
Sam: I don't have the earring, but I can talk to you telepathically in any language. How about Italian, darling? (laughter)
Laura: Stop being creepy, Scanlan.
Sam: I sense my hour is coming to an end soon.
Matt: You guys are about 20 minutes out, both you and Grog, before you lose your forms.
Liam: Do you know binary? One, zero, zero, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, zero, one...
Marisha: Speak in Morse code.
Matt: Another ten, 15 minutes of descending these stairs that seem to go on and on and on, and you guys are starting to hear this (low rumbling), but it is getting steadily louder the further down you climb, Vax. You begin to see along the metallic walls, occasionally, shapes in the metal. And you glance over, Vax, and look, and you can see, carved from the metal, humanoid, armored warriors standing about ten or so feet tall, larger than normal. Their poses vary. Some of them are on the side, some of them are attacking, some of them are defending, and about every 25 or 30 feet or so, there will be one on one side or the other.
Liam: Are they standing free, or are they carved from the wall?
Matt: No, they're from the wall.
Laura: They're drawings?
Matt: They're reliefs. They're metallic reliefs in the wall.
Travis: Not some metal Medusa that turned them into metal?
Matt: Made of the same metal, it looks like, as the walls around them.
Taliesin: I'm going to quickly inspect one.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: I'm rolling terribly. Nine.
Matt: Nine.
Laura: I want to look at them, too. I want to fly up on my broom. I was going to say it and then he said it.
Travis: Please don't be golems that will come out and fight us.
Laura: Investigation? 22.
Matt: 22? Glancing around the seams, these appear to be just reliefs in the wall. There is no deeper seam. Their proportions are flattened. They are designs in the wall.
Taliesin: Does the style indicate anything?
Matt: The craftsmanship is extraordinary, the detail. Because you rolled so high, you can tell that these are just reliefs in the wall, but up until that point, it looks like the detail in the nooks and crannies are so microscopic, you can see texture on the skin, almost. Like pores carved in. It's immaculate. It's artistic, the level of detail put into these.
Marisha: Grog. Do you trust this?
Travis: To what are you pointing?
Marisha: The reliefs, the people in the wall? Okay. It was a hypothetical question.
Travis: Right. Do I trust the art?
Marisha: Just to be safe, I cast Freedom of Movement on Grog. Just in case.
Travis: Ooh. I start popping and locking.
Marisha: So loose. So free. So much movement.
Matt: So that lasts for an hour, great.
Laura: I'm going to be stealthy. I don't want to be noisy.
Matt: Okay. Roll stealth, please.
Laura: 32.
Matt: Okay. So what is the marching order here, please?
Travis: I don't actually mind taking the lead on this one.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Do we have five minutes left, or less?
Matt: You're pushing about ten minutes or so at this point.
Travis: I think five to ten minutes, actually.
Laura: Yeah, you had said 15.
Taliesin: I love walking on the wall.
Sam: We could stay like this forever.
Taliesin: So I'll be in the middle of the group, walking on the wall.
Sam: I'm so beautiful.
Travis: You look over and Scanlan's going (kisses).
Sam: So symmetrical.
Liam: I'm actually going to hang back.
Matt: Okay, so Vax behind. It's Percy and Grog up front.
Laura: I'm going to go up behind Percy.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll be with Vex.
Sam: I will fly up next to Grog and put my Healing Touch hand on his shoulder and heal him a lot. (hums) 31.
Matt: You heal 31 hit points, Grog.
Sam: Oh, plus three. 34.
Matt: There you go.
Sam: And you're also freed from any curse, disease, or blindness that you have, just FYI.
Liam: I'm also going to dump 20 hit points of Lay on Hands on my own damn self.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: Wait, is that ding to your saving throws considered a curse?
Matt: It is a curse that can only be broken by a god.
Laura: If he fucking brings it up to a god. He doesn't even realize he has it.
Travis: I tried to talk to Pelor, but people were like, "No, don't talk to Pelor."
Laura: What are you fucking talking about?
Travis: What are you talking about?
Matt: Grog, continuing the charge forward, taking the steps, eventually you begin to see a source of some light. A faint, orangish-red light. Your initial instinct, based on your previous travels through here, is molten rock. It's a very similar orangish-red color from this distance. As you descend, step upon heavy step upon heavy step, you watch as you can see a square orange opening below. As in, the pointed hallway that leads you down comes to an end, and the stairs descend into a chamber.
Travis: I'll go in.
Laura: Would Trinket's little feet hurt if he was on the ground?
Matt: Do you want to put Trinket out of your necklace?
Laura: Well, I figure I would have tried to put him out when we got in the tunnel, but if his feet were hurting, I would have put him back in the necklace.
Matt: I would say Trinket's not comfortable, yeah.
Laura: Okay, I'll keep him in, then.
Matt: Okay. So. As you descend, Grog, the staircase continues below as the hallway comes to an end, and you find yourself descending into the center of a massive hexagonal chamber. The walls climb about 25 feet on each of the hexagonal sides. There's one flat wall ahead of you, and you assume probably one behind, though you cannot see it from your current perspective on the staircase. You can see that the walls are still made from the long plates of intricate, hammered metal, black and red-tinted with dust and rock and whatever other materials were forged into the actual metal. The support girders of dark red metal marks the seam at every wall-plate, like when you entered the hallway above. Central to the chamber ahead of you, across the wall that you see there, there is a glowing pit of heated coals, about 15 feet on any side that marks the floor before a giant, metal wall with two X-shaped cross beams that hit the corners of where that wall begins on each side. And in the center where they meet, you see a raised relief of solid gold bolted there that surrounds an opening of some kind. There's a space in that golden relief.
Travis: What's the floor look like from here to there? The same surface?
Matt: Same metallic surface.
Travis: Any seams, or just smooth?
Matt: Well, no, for the floor in here, it would be fairly smooth.
Laura: How high off the ground is that relief?
Matt: It's 25 feet to the ceiling, and it's halfway down, so it's about 12 and a half feet in the center, so from the ground, you'd have to get up to see it.
Travis: I move closer towards that.
Matt: Okay. You walk up, and you come to the very bottom of the last step. (grunts) Leap onto the ground, walk forward to the edge of where the coals are, there at the base of your feet. You glance up and you can see it. Make a perception check.
Travis: Hold on. 17.
Matt: All right, you glance up and you can see the relief of solid gold. The opening in it is triangle-shaped, roughly one foot across from point to point, like that. It comes into a triangular point. And it's about that size; it's about a foot, and then a foot, and then a foot.
Laura: I think you're supposed to stick your hand in it, Grog.
Travis: It's just the triangle shape, right? There's nothing else around it?
Matt: It's a weird rough circle, and then the triangle is carved into the center of it. The two walls immediately to the right and the left of that, where the hexagonal pulls back to each side, you see two more of those metal warrior reliefs that you saw earlier in the hallway.
Travis: And the coals are in a circle?
Matt: The coals are in a square section, a 15 by 15-foot square section of the floor in front of you that leads right up to the wall with the giant X meeting the seams in the relief.
Travis: (sighs) Might have to Tony Robbins this shit, right?
Laura: Does it look like anything's supposed to go in the triangle? Does it look like a keyhole?
Matt: It looks like a gold relief that has a triangular hole in it. That's all you can see.
Laura: Can we see how deep the hole goes?
Matt: You'd have to get closer to it.
Laura: I want to get close to it on my broom and look at it.
Matt: All right, you fly up above the coals, and the heat emanating from the coals below you is extremely hot. You can see it warping the air above it, so you have to protect yourself a bit and squint the eyes, and you swear you can smell the scent of burning hair. And you get up close and you can see the relief, perhaps some sort of triangular or pyramid-like shape would slip into it. It looks like all the corners eventually converge to a point on the interior of it.
Laura: Okay. All right. I back up so that I'm not in the fumes.
Travis: Is there anything else in the room besides the two reliefs on either side that we can see? Tools?
Matt: Do you guys want to walk around the back of the staircase? As you guys move around the back of the staircase, the wall on the opposite side of that relief contains a third armored warrior relief embedded in the wall. You can see there are four pillars right along the side of where the staircase descends that contain bolted-in, large braziers that contain ever-burning flames, flickering, that give that orange-red glow, similar to the coals you saw embedded in the ground as you arrived. And then on the back side of the staircase and the column that held it aloft, you recognize it immediately, Grog, strangely. Because while you've not cared or understood what these things are before, suddenly you know what it is. You see a large metal-- it looks like a well, almost, but there is a furnace built into it and a number of tools that are hanging to the side, small tongs and heavy leather gauntlets. This is a smelter.
Laura: Oh, that's where we have to smelt the platinum. Do we see anything around the room that looks like it could fit in that pyramid shape?
Sam: I'm going to cast, again, Detect Good and Evil, and do a swoop around and see if I sense any creatures or magically consecrated objects.
Matt: Okay. You swoop around the room. You detect no evil. You detect no magically consecrated objects. And at that point, the spell's about to fade or become permanent.
Sam: (sighs) Big choice.
Laura: You mean, you'll stay like that forever? You can't undo it?
Sam: Yes, my child. I will drop the spell.
Matt: Okay. And with that, a smaller Scanlan form appears, the planetar angelic form vanishing, and he drops about four feet and lands on his feet on the ground.
Sam: I feel my back, covered in hair. I'm back.
Matt: And a moment later, Grog, your form drops as well, and you revert back to normal Grog size. Still massive.
Travis: So we're supposed to smelt the platinum, right? Melt it down. And then we use our magic beans to make the Prime Trammels.
Taliesin: Do I understand how this triangle works?
Matt: This triangle does not at all resemble any of the designs that you had imbued upon you.
Taliesin: I'm going to hop up to take a better look at it, as well.
Matt: Okay. So you walk up the side and look into it and you can see it's a triangle, and then pushing inward, all the points converge on the inside where it would fit a pyramid structure, about one foot on each side, corner to corner.
Taliesin: And the point at which they connect, is that about a quarter size, would you say?
Matt: The point where it connects, it goes to a complete point.
Taliesin: Complete point, okay.
Travis: And that relief is in the middle of two crossbeams? So you couldn't push the crossbeams over and lay it down flat?
Matt: Well, the cross beams are bolted to the actual wall.
Travis: It's not something we have to lay flat.
Liam: Did you say there were two metal warriors?
Matt: There are two metal warriors to the right and left and then one on the back wall.
Liam: And are they separated from where we are by hot coals, or can you walk right up to them?
Matt: The only hot coals are the ones that reside directly beneath the relief.
Liam: Okay, so I'm going to check one of those out. See if it's any different than what we passed in that hallway.
Marisha: And you said there were three warriors?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: And we can get to the smelter right now, or it's beyond the crossbeams?
Matt: The smelter is on the other of the room, behind the staircase.
Laura: All the shit we need?
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: 24.
Matt: 24. You approach, and look up into the warrior, and you can see the three of them are all in the same stance. They're all standing square. They all are clutching a long greatsword in one hand. The other appears to be open to either receive something or hold aloft something that's not there, and they're all facing forward.
Liam: I'm shooting my wings out as I walk up to them, as well.
Matt: Okay. (whoosh) Your wings arc outward. Looking ahead, you can see the armored helmet that adorns its head that normally would pincer to where the nose is, and you can see the pores of the face. The helmet is one, big, domed curve on top, and where a face would be, there is no face. There's the outside of the head and a similar triangle gap in the face that's smaller than the one in the relief. You glance over quickly into the other warrior, and the third, and all three of them are faceless, instead having an empty triangle that disappears into the face.
Liam: It goes inward like the big one.
Matt: Yes. But they're smaller.
Marisha: While he does that, I stand in the middle. Are the three warriors triangulated, if you were to draw out a triangle between them?
Matt: In the hexagonal room, yes, they would be.
Marisha: In the same shape?
Matt: It seems to be. Close enough, at least, based on the construction of the chamber.
Travis: What did the reliefs have in their hands? Weapons? Swords? Axes? Hammers?
Matt: No, they're all greatswords, but they're also part of the relief embedded in the wall.
Travis: Okay.
Marisha: And one open hand.
Matt: One open hand. It's embedded in the wall, and the other one is open to the side. But the relief is all embedded in the wall, and you can see the triangular opening. The only thing that darts inward is that vacuous shape in the face.
Laura: This is where Vox Machina dies because they can't figure out--
Taliesin: We can't figure out how the triangle works.
Marisha: Is there anything on the floor? Any patterns on the floor?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: The smelter, is it active right now? Is it hot?
Travis: Yeah, the coals are cooking.
Matt: The smelter is low, but it's burning.
Sam: What if we have to make something triangular?
Laura: Yeah, to fit in those things.
Marisha: 13.
Matt: 13? Doesn't appear to be. The floor is pretty solid. There's no real detail that catches your attention.
Taliesin: Let's start smelting.
Laura: Yeah. Might as well.
Sam: What if we take those beans and put them in the little triangle holes? I don't know. In their hands?
Matt: Well, the statues are in the wall and you can see the outer shape, barely protruding from the wall, so it would be hard to place something in the hand.
Laura: Yeah, we switched all our gold for platinum in Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, so let's start the smelter, at the very least.
Matt: Okay. The bellows are there. The big old heavy bellows, and Grog, you know exactly what to do. It's a really strange phenomenon to be like, "I've never done this," but it's second nature, and you begin to get that forge to well and burn, and brightly. You can see the flames and the coals heat up from dull red to a bright orange to a white at times, and as it heats up, you have the tongs. What do you smelt in?
Marisha: But what to smelt in?
Travis: I'm going to walk across.
Matt: You get the sense here that smelting is the heating and liquefying of metals: one, to remove impurities, and two, to then pour into a mold in which, when it cools, the metal makes the shape of whatever the mold is.
Laura: Can I fly up to the circle on the wall, on the crossbeams? Does it come off?
Matt: You reach out and you touch the gold relief. It's built into the wall. It's a smooth, shiny, polished gold, but it's not moving at all.
Laura: We can't find anything that makes a triangle shape, a pyramid shape, in the room?
Taliesin: The faces of the statuary. Maybe we should prod them. We might as well start prodding things, because nothing's going to happen if we don't prod them. I'm going to crawl up to one of the statuary soldiers and see if the helmet comes off, or if the face is removable. I'm going to start tinkering.
Matt: You reach up and grab the side and feel the side of the face and reach into the inside of the gap in the triangular void, if you will.
Taliesin: That thing is going to go click, isn't it?
Matt: No, your fingers slide in. It does come to a vanishing point. It comes to a point like the larger relief. Once you look inside and get a glance with the little bit of light that's in there, the shape on the inside of it is different. It's imperfect and messed up. It's hard to see what it is, but it's not a perfect triangle like the rest. Also, immediately, you guys see there's a flash of orange light that completely surrounds the exterior of the warrior, and the two other warriors, their entire outer line glows a bright orange, and with that, you instinctually step back--
Taliesin: I step up.
Matt: Or yeah, step up, as all three of them (heavy movement) step out of the wall. Unlike the ones you saw previously that were pressed in and relief, these have a little more dimension to them, and the majority of their physical form was embedded backwards into the wall. They all of a sudden come storming outward, giant greatswords swinging in front of them, as they all immediately, the heads creepily with the open, triangular void of where a face would be spin to one of the nearby individuals in their space.
Laura: Ooh, maybe we have to kill them and then smelt into their faces.
Taliesin: I'm into it. I like this plan.
Marisha: Don't destroy their faces!
Matt: That's where we'll pick up next week, because it is almost 11:00.
Laura: All right. How tall are they? How big were they?
Matt: They're about ten to 12 feet tall?
Laura: And they're made out of metal?
Matt: They're made out of the same metal material, it looks like, that the walls are.
Laura: They're golems.
Matt: Constructs of some kind.
Travis: Those crossbeams, do they look like they're structurally integral to the room?
Matt: No. They're bolted against the far wall, and it looks more ornamental, or at least there are seams against that back wall to hold a relief there or at least that's where the relief is placed. You get the sense with more inspection, you'd get a better feel, but it doesn't look like, immediately at glance, it's integral to the design. So! We'll pick up right at the beginning of those large, metallic creatures emerging from the walls and the ensuing conflict next week. In the meantime, thank you guys so much for joining us on the next crazy step of our adventure.
Marisha: Happy birthday!
Matt: Happy birthday, yeah.
Laura: It's still for another hour! Thank you, Magic: the Gathering - Puzzle Quest.
Matt: Yes, thank you Puzzle Quest, Magic  the Gathering edition for being our fantastic sponsor. Thank you guys for watching. We'll pick up next week, and then after that is GenCon.
Laura: (laughs) Oh jeez.
Matt: So after next week is GenCon, so start getting that ready.
Travis: Oh shit. Oh my god, we're going right into it.
Matt: Yep. (laughs) Two weeks. All right. Have a good night, guys, rest well, thank you for coming, and as always--
Laura: I'll most likely kill you in the morning.
Matt: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hi, everyone! Welcome to Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Good job, Sam. Thank you for your patience. Sorry we were off last week. I'm doing much better, for those who are worried about it. Happy to be back. Missed you guys, and happy to be back at this table. So yeah! It's been a couple of weeks. Let's go ahead and get into some announcements real fast. First off, tonight we have our fantastic sponsor, Shadow of War!
Travis: Shadow of War! Oh shit!
Laura: Are we allowed to say what we did in it?
Matt: Yeah, a number of us actually worked in the game. It comes out October 10th, actually.
Sam: And the full name of the game is Middle Earth: Shadow of War, for all of those who are looking for it alphabetically.
Travis: The sequel to Middle Earth  Shadow of Mordor.
Sam: Yes, and many of us were in the game yelling our asses off. I played a little character known as Orc 4. It was so much! I did 20 recording sessions.
Travis: I remember talking to you! I was Commanding Orc 1.
Sam: Oh, nice.
Matt: I was Professional Orc 1, as well as the Witch King of Angmar, the head of the Nazgul. I'm pretty excited about that.
Laura: Oh, nice!
Liam: I was Troy Baker's fluffer. It's prestigious.
Sam: You were in it, right? No?
Liam: I'm in the first one.
Sam: Oh, what did you do in the first one?
Liam: The thing I killed two weeks ago? That was me.
Sam: Laura, were you in it?
Laura: I am in it. I play the Blade of Galadriel.
Liam: You play a sword?!
Laura: I know! Get this, so I'm an assassin elf, right? She's really cool. The DLC is going to be about my character.
Sam: Do you have a number after your character?
Laura: No, it's the only one. It's the coolest thing! I don't think I ever told you this. When I saw the character design? She's a combo of Vex and Vax.
Matt: That's pretty great.
Laura: No, seriously, though, she's an elf chick. So she's an assassin. She's got dual-wielding, and she wears feathery armor. It's so freaking cool! So basically, it's like if Vax was a girl, which is Vex.
Travis: But with the sex appeal of Grog.
Laura: Of course, baby.
Matt: I will never forget being at the Shadow of War panel at Comic Con, and you mentioning the DLC and then going, "Has that even been announced yet?" And there was five seconds where I watched Laura wither away into a shell of a human before they went, "Oh, yeah, it's announced." And you reverted.
Laura: Even at this very moment, as I said it, aftershocks. "Was I supposed to say that?"
Liam: They scare you so bad that, even when it's official, I'm like "I'm in the--"
Travis: It's such a dope game. The Nemesis system has been improved on from last time. We can testify.
Sam: We're supposed to mention that on the 18th of this month, Shadow of War will be debuting a brand new live-action trailer that will take you near the game? No! Right into the game. Soon we'll need to choose whether to save or slay. During the break tonight, they're going to be showing off some awesome videos from the game. It drops October 10th. Go buy it and try to pick out our voices in the game as you slay us.
Travis: And make us rise to the higher echelons of the orc order.
Matt: By the way, if you haven't played the previous game, the Nemesis system is one of the coolest things I've played in many games in a long time. I'm going to challenge you guys to try and pick out not only who you voice orc-wise, but then to try and make sure our orcs rise to the very top. So you have nothing but generals from Critical Role. I challenge you for this. Because that would be pretty cool.
Liam: I hope you like hearing the word ranger.
Liam: Ranger!
Travis: Ranger!
Laura: Ranger!
Matt: It's going to be fun. All right, thank you, Shadow of War for being our sponsor tonight. We're excited about the game, and hope you are, too. Also, there's been a lot of insane weather tragedies that have been in the news recently. I want to make sure that everyone knows that if you want to help support relief for both of the hurricanes that have come and torn through the U.S., we have a link to the Red Cross to donate and be part of that. It'll be available in the chat and throughout the rest of the game tonight, so if you have the opportunity to help out, I highly recommend it. Come help these people that have lost a lot in the past couple weeks or so. Give what you can. I've given, and we really appreciate that support.
Travis: They'll let you delineate between Harvey and Irma, too, in case you want to pick one over the other. Harvey had a lot of support from J.J. Watt's $30+ million dollars. Irma, the damage is still accruing.
Matt: I grew up in Florida. I know the area well, and I have family out there that endured it. It's very close to me. So if you can, greatly appreciate it. Let's see here. Merch! Laura.
Laura: This feels so weird to say after you mentioned that.
Travis: Nah, but we make happy stuff.
Laura: Happy stuff! Which, by the way, you're wearing your Dalen's Closet shirt, Matt, and it matches your eyeballs so beautifully.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: I'll show it to you, and my back brace, to make it really better.
Sam: Are we selling those in the store?
Matt: The back brace?
Travis: Critical Role back brace! Do you DM 20 hours a week? We've got something for you!
Liam: We missed an opportunity to put Backblaze on that back brace. (groaning)
Laura: Next time.
Matt: Next time.
Liam: No next time!
Laura: There are Dalen's Closet shirts in the store. Go check them out. There's tank tops. They're really cool; they're cheaper because they are sleeveless. That's less material. Dagger, Dagger, Dagger; it's been re-released. We have the Scanlan tee; we have all the tees. And it's getting cooler now, so the hoodie is still in the store; the softest hoodie ever is there. Go check it out. We have hats and we have key chains and necklaces and pencils and aprons and tarot cards, and other stuff. And more stuff coming! So keep your eyes peeled.
Matt: Thank you, Laura. Also reminding you guys, we have up to episode 40 of Critical Role now released on iTunes, Google, and geekandsundry.com has all the information for it. So if you want to listen to the podcast, or your friends have been like, "I don't want to watch it, but I just want to hear it."
Laura: I want to watch it, but I don't want to watch it.
Matt: It's good for commutes.
Marisha: Also, clarification, speaking of saying things prematurely before I should have. I've gotten a lot of questions being like, "What happened to that plan of rolling out one a day once a week?" Yeah, that plan didn't turn out to be feasible. And I might have said that-- I said it, and then I looked down at the announcement sheet and it said in parenthesis afterward, "But do not announce this part." Which, why was it even on our announcement sheet? Still my fault.
Matt: To be fair, I remember looking down at the sheet as you were announcing it.
Marisha: Oh shit. Anyway, it's never going to happen because they're easier to do in batch. So ten at a time. That's what you get.
Taliesin: It's like one cookie at a time. You can't bake one cookie at a time.
Marisha: It's just better to do them in a block.
Matt: Thank you for the heads-up on that. We announced a while back the Critical Role six-issue mini-series comic book. We announced last week that it's going through Dark Horse, which I'm super excited about.
Travis: DM is very excited.
Matt: Oh, yeah. Dark Horse was my introduction. I was probably in fourth grade when I got into the Alien comics through Dark Horse. I didn't realize there was more to explore. Dude, I've been a fan of them ever since. Being able to take this into their realm is brilliant. I'm so excited. First issue drops on the 20th, guys.
Marisha: The digital issue. The first issue releases digitally this coming Wednesday.
Sam: Is it good? I haven't read it.
Laura: It's so good!
Sam: Why have you all read it and I haven't?
Marisha: Because you don't read your emails.
Sam: Yeah, that's fair.
Liam: You show up ten minutes after we start, you leave an hour before we end the game every week.
Sam: That's true.
Matt: So that's coming up. It will be on Comixology, iBooks, Dark Horse Digital, Kindle, Nook, Google Play, etc. It's written by our good friend, Matt Colville. It's drawn beautifully by our good friend, Olivia Samson from the Critter community, and the coloring and lettering by Chris Northrop. Super stoked, hope you guys enjoy it. So look out for that next week.
Liam: Looks fucking awesome! The writing is awesome! The art is awesome!
Matt: What he said.
Laura: Did you already say about the physical copies, too? When those will be released?
Matt: We'll have a trade available in spring 2018.
Liam: It's coming out with the DLC for Middle Earth.
Matt: Yeah, to tie in with it. Of course, we have Talks Machina coming up this Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific, here with our fantastic host, Brian. We'll be talking about our episode tonight. So look for that next week. All the Critical Role episodes are now available on Alpha. They've gone back and added the bells and whistles, the information, the stats, everything, for all the episodes before Alpha even launched. So if you ever watched it there, it's all updated.
Sam: I really should check my email!
Taliesin: We would miss this sense of wonder that we get to share with the community. It's really nice.
Marisha: They get your unbridled reaction.
Taliesin: It's like watching Home Alone next to Macaulay Culkin. It's great. I'm getting so much out of it.
Matt: All righty. Last few things. One  this is Sub-tember, guys, by the way, for Twitch. Sub-tember means for the next few weeks, Twitch has a special promotion where subscriptions are half off for new subs for every Twitch channel, including this one. So if you've been watching and you've always wanted to subscribe, but you never really felt like you can give the full $5, it's half off this month. So if you want to subscribe to our Twitch, now's the month to do it. Just giving the heads-up. It's pretty rad, and thank you, Sub-tember. Last but not least, Laura and Travis, you are going to be at an event soon, aren't you?
Travis: Yeah! End of this month, we're going to be at Anime Weekend Atlanta. The last week of September. Hotlanta, Georgia. We're going to be there with other people like Jennifer Hale and people like that. But we're going to be there. Come out, say hi, smack our hands, not our faces.
Laura: Give a high-five.
Marisha: I love Atlanta.
Travis: It's pretty dope. I want to get in that aquarium with those whale sharks. That's what I want to do. We're not going to have time for that. And then, also, in the middle of November, we're going to be going to Australia. Laura and I are going for two weeks. We're going to be in Adelaide, Brisbane. So for all the Aussies-- what?
Laura: I've got to get my passport.
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Expedite!
Travis: So barring Laura's passport showing up--
Matt: You can hear the $400 burn away instantly. That's how much it costs to expedite.
Laura: Oh my god. I'm doing that tomorrow! I'm going to write a note in my calendar.
Travis: (sighs) Adelaide, Brisbane. If you're there, you want to see us, come see maybe just me. (laughter)
Sam: Everybody tweet Laura tomorrow at noon, saying--
Laura: No, but seriously! If you want to, feel free.
Travis: Will Friedle will be there, too. He's going to be my convention wife. Me and Friedle.
Laura: I'm writing an email to myself.
Marisha: Australia? Is that when we got caught with having to have those weird travel visas, as well?
Matt: Yeah. Make sure you get your travel visas.
Marisha: Yeah, we didn't know until we got to the airport. And then they're like, "You have to have one." And then we're like, "Oh, okay." Luckily, you can do it online.
Travis: Oh, I totally have that covered.
Matt: All right. Well, cool, guys! Thank you so much. Thank you for dealing with our long announcements. It's been a few weeks. However, I think, with that, it's time to dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Welcome back. I'll remember this. Why's everything targeting Scanlan in this battle? Welcome back, everyone. So last we left off, Vox Machina, preparing themselves for a final fray with the recently ascended god, Vecna, the Undying King, discovered that he had brought the city of Thar Amphala about 300 miles northwest, of Vasselheim on the continent of Issylra. Upon gathering allies to assail this region, you discovered that it was shifting, moving. And apparently the corpse of the long dead primordial earth titan had been risen and began marching its way towards Vasselheim with Thar Amphala embedded at the top of its torso, protected by some sort of magical barrier. With an advance army of wyvern riders at your back and J'mon Sa Ord giving you a ride between their wings, you made your way southward. Quickly depositing yourselves within a waterfall, expelling opening towards the hip of this large titan undead beast, you began to fight your way to the interior. Dealing with corrupted earth elemental shards, you began to make your way through the catacombs, the long ruined and abandoned dwarven city of Thomara, where you encountered the tomb of the dwarven king. Where you also managed to raid the tomb, found a magical item, and dealt with some fun traps in the process. Then, continuing to follow where this route led you upward, hopefully towards the underbelly of the city of Thar Amphala, you uncovered a mostly cleaned out vault and did battle with some undead trolls that immediately rushed in and attacked you. You managed to destroy them, and make your way out through a small cavern that had just momentarily collapsed, clearing out of the way. You all began to squeeze through the opening to find the next length of your journey. And that's where we left off. As you guys all crawl through this recently cleared opening, you come into a partially collapsed cavern about 20 or so feet wide in places with elements of the ceiling fallen in. You can see the rocks that are scattered amongst the ground rumbling with each impact of the feet of the titan you're currently riding within. It seems to be going at a steady incline beginning baseline and then about 20 feet ahead, begin to rise upward to about a 30 to 45-degree angle with the next 25, 30 or so feet.
Sam: How do you play Dungeons and Dragons?
Matt: Two weeks, Sam? It's too much for you?
Sam: I've forgotten entirely what we're supposed to do now. Insight check! I got nothing.
Liam: I'm going to do my due diligence and scoot a little ahead of everybody and start looking for traps or anything hinky.
Travis: Wait, Vax. You should consult that little scrawny NPC fellow that was supposed-- oh, wait. Oh, he's dead.
Liam: Did anybody see that guy?
Travis: Nope.
Laura: Yeah, we did. We saw him.
Matt: Well, you saw the corpse after it was there, yeah.
Liam: Nobody asked me about him.
Laura: No, because you did a good job of killing that.
Liam: That clearly undead cannibal dwarf eating flesh, as I saw it, so problem solved. We're on a time table, yeah?
Laura: We should keep moving upwards, I'm assuming?
Sam: Did we get any items recently?
Travis: No, I picked up that hammer that was hitting me in the face.
Laura: Well, yeah. But Percy, the belt?
Sam: Yeah, what does it do?
Taliesin: Stuff, things. I'm using it right now.
Marisha: Do we need to do a switchery-poo of our items?
Laura: I think we maybe should do that, actually.
Sam: We all have potions, right? Did we pass out potions?
Travis: We all have at least the one superior from the brass dragon.
Liam: Are we going to take a little 20-minute breather here?
Sam: This is just for us to remember what we're doing. I don't know. Should we stop? I think we're on a timetable. We should keep moving, right? Does anyone need to heal?
Marisha: We just stopped, right?
Matt: You'd taken a brief rest after the battle with the trolls where you guys began to look about the inside of the vault. And that's where the part of the exit collapsed.
Travis: I didn't roll any hit dice. Should we roll some hit dice?
Marisha: You dug things out?
Laura: But he was doing something? He was reading, or something.
Sam: Yeah, you were trying to read Dwarvish, or something. And it took an hour.
Travis: I clearly do not remember this. That's right, I remember. I don't remember what I read, but I remember.
Sam: It just said, "Do not enter."
Travis: Yep. There were things.
Liam: We're doing the Vox Machina thing and standing around like a bunch of dumb fucks trying to figure out what to do. I'm going to attune the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic damage.
Matt: All righty. Necrotic it is.
Travis: We also need to be on the lookout for that sword, remember? In the story?
Sam: The sword of Kas?
Travis: Just saying. Keep your eyes peeled, high-perception people.
Laura: All right.
Taliesin: I literally can't see anything.
Laura: Wait, we have light.
Marisha: (whoosh)
Laura: Yeah, see?
Matt: Between her hand, his dagger, and Pike's mace, you have a few light sources that you guys maintain.
Laura: Pike's mace is lit up. We said that last time.
Matt: But do keep in mind that light sources also do make you a bright beacon in dark places.
Laura: Probably your hands are less noticeable than Pike's mace.
Liam: Oh, I don't know.
Taliesin: I think they would be less intimidated by a glowing mace than by glowing hands, at this point.
Matt: Glowing hands is like a small torch firelight. The Mace of Disruption--
Liam: Is like a headlamp.
Laura: So maybe we'll not have the mace on.
Liam: "Yeah, okay. I'll put this away."
Laura: That sounded just like her.
Sam: She's turning more and more Canadian as you go.
Liam: She's kind of Canadian already. Come on.
Matt: So if I could have a marching order, please?
Liam: Yo. Up front, looking for traps.
Laura: Did you want this acid-resistant armor? You'd at least be resistant to acid.
Travis: And Vex is probably with her brother. I'll be right behind the twins. It's the twins and then me. Who wants to be behind?
Taliesin: I'll be behind you.
Matt: Okay. Do you have Trinket out, Vex?
Laura: Yeah, Trinket is out.
Matt: Percy's after Grog.
Marisha: Me.
Matt: Keyleth, and then we have Pike and Scanlan holding up the rear. All righty, there you go. Have that marked down. How far ahead are you tracking?
Liam: 20 feet.
Matt: So 20 feet ahead, you begin to make your way up the incline, and it is loose rock in this tunnel. As you step, there are elements that skid and fall beneath the pressure of your feet, and you have to be careful as you progress up the incline based on how much it continues upward to keep your footing.
Laura: Brother.
Liam: Yeah?
Laura: Make sure you stay within 60 feet of me.
Liam: I turn around and look at her and go  all right.
Laura: You said you're 20 fucking feet in front of me, I'm using my fucking earring to whisper to you.
Liam: You're stage-whispering and that's very easy to hear.
Laura: Stay within fucking 60 feet of me, all right?
Liam: I love you. Perception check. Investigation for traps? Yeah. That is a 25.
Matt: Okay. No traps catch your attention. As you progress forward, you begin to notice the tunnel seems to be pincering a bit the further you go. The sides of the walls begin to close in and eventually, about 30 feet ahead, comes from the 15, 20-foot width that the initial entrance way into this carved tunnel was, pinches to about three feet wide.
Sam: How tall?
Matt: About five and half, six feet tall?
Taliesin: Is this pressure by design, or is this what's been done to the structure by the transformation?
Matt: You'll probably have to get closer to see. Where you are currently, it looks like part of the tunnel was carved outward and then shaken, and elements of it collapsed and loosened the earth that at one point was packed at the sides.
Laura: And the tunnel's rising steadily upwards?
Matt: Yeah. It's coming at an incline.
Travis: How's it look?
Liam: It's dark up there. I can only see about 60 feet up. Does it keep going beyond that?
Matt: The incline isn't increasing. It gets to about a 45-degree incline and then maintains that up until the outside of your visual range.
Liam: Okay. I'm a punching bag for this shit. Why don't you all wait here a minute. Wait.
All: Wait.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up there?
Liam: Well, will you go with me?
Laura: Of course. Can you not use your wings?
Liam: They're gone.
Laura: Well, then hop on.
Liam: This could be the last time we do this. Come on.
Sam: Oh god.
Liam: Well, there's only four games left, Sam.
Laura: You don't know that!
Liam: It's scripted! (laughter)
Marisha: That's going to be a Reddit thread later.
Laura: Do we have Pass Without a Trace on?
Liam: Yeah, I think that probably faded by now.
Matt: Not if you haven't recast it because after the short rest it would've been gone.
Laura: Should I cast that on us?
Liam: Yes.
Laura: No, wait! I shouldn't because I got a proficiency, so we're both stealthy stealth. We're fine. So we're just going to go. I'm not casting it. But here's the thing. Everybody stay right at the bottom. We're going to fly up, but we're not going to fly up more than 60 feet away from them.
Liam: Right. We'll go 60 feet up, see what we can see.
Laura: And then come back down.
Liam: Sure. Or you could stay there and I could go even further up 60 feet--
Laura: All right. As long as everybody's within 60 feet of me. Because we're getting really close and I don't want Vecna to see us. I've got this ring.
Taliesin: That's right. I forgot about the ring.
Liam: All right. Let's do that.
Matt: So as you guys glide up on the broom, stealthily, I want you guys both to roll a stealth check, please.
Travis: Pick from your fucking 300 dice.
Laura: Ooh, that's good.
Travis: Almost poked my eye out. You almost made me Vecna.
Laura: 30.
Liam: 29.
Laura: 30.
Matt: All right. That's impressive. So as you both quietly coast your way past this entrance way, squeezing into this two and a half, three-foot-wide location, you get just within the 60 foot range and look up and Vax, you step off the broom and make your way quietly up to the other side of the range. You get about 30 feet beyond the broom before your vision meets where this tunnel seems to end and it looks like there is a solid, rocky blockage.
Laura: What do you see?
Liam: It's corked up. It's all right. Yeah, it's blocked up with stone. I guess I'd have to get a closer look to see if we could get through.
Laura: Well, get a fucking closer look.
Taliesin: If we have to, we can just have Grog beat it down.
Laura: Yes, but quiet is the key word.
Taliesin: Is it? We can try and time it to a step.
Liam: Hand on the sides to get my way up closer to it. Looking for any traps.
Matt: Go ahead and make an athletics check as you're climbing up to maintain the strength, as the incline is now towards the end getting more and more steep.
Liam: Get ready to catch me.
Laura: I'm going to hover.
Liam: Yes! My athletics is a two, but I rolled a 19, so 21.
Matt: Deftly, you manage to find the proper handholds and pull your strength up as the final bit becomes a little bit of a upper body weight carrying situation, and you come to the edge of the rock and you see it. It does appear to be a rocky cave-in or larger boulder that has fallen or been placed to close. It looks to be one solid rock, yeah. At this point, the entrance is about four foot by two foot. And it's all blocked by one solid piece of rock.
Liam: Yeah. We're not getting through this. Hey. I'm not getting through this, you're not. Maybe Kiki can.
Laura: Do we see any other openings?
Matt: This would be a perception check.
Sam: Matt, my friends just told me to start paying attention to the cadence of the steps to see if they change in any discernible way.
Marisha: That's what we're doing. While they do that, we're timing the steps out.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: 20.
Matt: 20? Okay.
Taliesin: Ugh.
Marisha: Ugh.
Sam: 15.
Marisha: 15.
Taliesin: 12.
Matt: It's not that difficult to discern the pattern of the steps. The entirety of this titan shifts and quakes with each footfall, so it's pretty easy to find the pattern. It rarely changes, and you imagine any slight shift that you feel as they're going about this is because it's stepping on or through terrain that is not flat. But it is a pretty discernible pattern.
Taliesin: We could go have Grog smash it down in tempo with the steps so that the sound will be covered.
Travis: Like Shawshank Redemption and the poop pipe.
Taliesin: I was thinking of the Tainted Love Levi's commercial.
Laura: Do I see any other--
Matt: Not really. It mostly looks like loose rock and the more you glance about with each impacting footfall, you see two or three errant rocks go. You guys watch as more rocks tumble down the incline.
Laura: Maybe we need to do this quickly. This doesn't seem like the most stable sort of tunnel. Hop on the broom, darling.
Taliesin: I like the idea of you punching this at the appropriate moment.
Marisha: It also saves me a 6th-level spell.
Travis: Well, that's what's most important. Are the Knuckles still doing that vibrating hum thing?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may.
Travis: And I would like to try and bash the shit out of this--
Taliesin: In tempo.
Laura: In tempo.
Matt: This is a tight tunnel for you. You have to crouch down, round your shoulders as you're doing it.
Travis: I'm going to do the one-inch punch.
Matt: Make an athletics check. With advantage, because you are raging.
Travis: Yeah, because I'm an angry monster. 21.
Matt: Okay. Here's the scenario  Vex and Vax, as you guys are on the broom in the tunnel, you look down and you know in Labyrinth, when the cleaner comes through the tunnel that fills the entirety of the space? You watch as this angry goliath starts up the tunnel towards you, and there does not appear to be much of any space you could squeeze through.
Liam: Is there a bubble at the top, maybe?
Laura: Grog?
Travis: What? (angry panting)
Laura: Can we pass under his legs or something?
Liam: Dive, dive!
Laura: Rage quietly.
Matt: You can both attempt to. Make an acrobatics check to attempt to squeeze between his legs.
Laura: At the same time? Acrobatics. 22.
Liam: 30-something.
Matt: It's not comfortable, but you both (popping) out the back, between his monstrous goliath thighs. From a backward perspective, those of you who are still waiting a little further down the tunnel from Vex: it's a unique sight, as the back end of your goliath friend suddenly gives birth to two half-elves. It's very Ace Ventura 2. However, you eventually climb your way angrily up to the very edge and there is the boulder, there, and you're about to go right towards it, but then stop and remember what your friends had said, and you wait patiently for the pattern of the next footfall. (boom)
Travis: (punch impact)
Matt: Go ahead and roll an attack.
Travis: Can I make it reckless-- oh, I didn't say it.
Laura: But you do extra damage because you're--
Travis: Oh, yeah, siege. Oh, it's fine. 30.
Matt: Yeah, all right, so roll 1d4 damage.
Travis: Okay, 1d4. Four!
Matt: Plus your strength modifier and your rage damage.
Travis: Eight. 27.
Matt: Whoa, wait, did you double it already?
Travis: No.
Matt: Wait, so it's four plus eight, 12.
Travis: And my rage damage is 15. Well, that's with the axe.
Matt: That's with the axe, yeah. No, that's your overall. So your rage damage at this level is four, because you just went up a level. So it's 12 plus four, so it's 16. So you do 32 points of bludgeoning damage with a single punch to this rock. With one hit, the entire boulder shifts and cracks, and you watch as part of it breaks away, and you see a brief glimmer of a dull light from the opposite side, as it rests back into place, heavily damaged.
Taliesin: (singing) Wait for it to go again and bump, bump, bump.
Matt: You wait for the next footfall of the titan (impact). You feel the impact and the shake. Do you want to go for another punch?
Travis: Do I hit it now?
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: Yes!
Laura: Yes!
Matt: Roll another attack.
Travis: Oh, that's even better. 33.
Matt: Easily enough. Go ahead and roll another d4.
Travis: Two plus eight. Ten plus--
Matt: Four for rage damage.
Travis: 14.
Matt: All right, and so with that, your fist slams into the boulder a second time. It explodes and shatters into hundreds of crumbled pieces of rock and stone goes firing across the distance of this tunnel, now revealing a little bit of flickering firelight. As you're sitting there seething with anger and your muscles and veins bulging with each breath--
Travis: I'm so swole right now.
Matt: Yeah. You can see above you, this entranceway opens up into a five-foot wide, ten-foot tall hallway that goes to the right and left. As you emerge, it goes a little bit to the right and front, and then to the back and behind you that direction.
Travis: Hey guys, it's a Z.
Laura: What do you see?
Travis: Let me find out. So I wiggle up a little more.
Marisha: So you know the first and last letter of the alphabet? Don't worry about it.
Matt: So you squeeze out of the small entrance way and step up into it. You can see now a well-constructed hallway. You can see there are stone slabs that are carved. The patterns and the angular architecture of this hall as it comes up into a trapezoid position. The hall comes in a bit, and the hallway rooftop is a flat, even surface. This is apparently a hall of dwarven make and seems to be a continuation of some sort of structure or pathway of Thomara.
Taliesin: Let the twins take a look. I think it would be safe.
Travis: It's a well-constructed hallway of dwarvish make. (groans)
Laura: We sneak under his legs again to like see what's going on.
Matt: You guys all eventually make your way up into this hallway. Now, it is still a five -foot-wide hallway, so you're still here in single-file progression one way or the other.
Liam: Twins are already at the top looking for problems.
Matt: Right, so you guys would be able to because it's a ten-foot-tall tunnel. You guys would be able to occupy a space above another party member if you were both on the broom.
Laura: Oh, should we be on the broom? No, you should be off the broom because you might check for traps. I'll check for traps along the wall and ceiling. And he's going to check for traps--
Liam: I'll take the lower half. That's called advantage.
Matt: So go ahead and make and investigation check.
Laura: Both of us or just him with advantage?
Matt: Both of you separately because you're investigating different elements of the hallway.
Liam: 18 for me.
Laura: Investigation? Natural fucking 20!
Matt: As you guys glance up and focus on the surrounding location. The hallway behind you goes for about 30 or so feet before it looks like a cave in. It looks like a mass of fully collapsed, broken stone. You can see bits of the hallway slabs that originally held up that part are collapsed inward and broken, left scattered across the ground. The other direction you go continues on and opens into a dark chamber about 60 feet ahead of you.
Laura: We should go toward the cave in, don't you think?
Matt: There are small built-in sconces that are magically, perpetually burning firelight.
Laura: Does this seem like there's any traps that could be set off as we walk towards the--?
Matt: You do not notice anything, as you were investigating specifically for that.
Taliesin: Check the sconces, see if they trigger something.
Laura: I'll look at the sconces.
Liam: I will look at the sconces.
Laura: I'll look at them better.
Matt: I included that as your perception for traps above. You did not notice anything that would be considered a trap.
Laura: You guys, there's no traps. We should head towards this darkened room.
Marisha: Save a life, check a sconce.
Liam: I'm going to creep about 40 feet down the hall and continue that search.
Matt: About 20 feet before this darkened chamber is there before you. As you get to the edge, you can see a little bit the very inside of this chamber. You can see a darkened brazier. It's your mind playing tricks on you. You thought you heard a raven.
Liam: Every day when I'm on the crapper, Matt. Everywhere.
Matt: A cold metallic brazier in the middle of the room. And that's as far as you can see into the chamber, before the edge of your visual range goes dark.
Taliesin: People don't install those unless there's something awful that needs to be done.
Marisha: Do we have any idea how far we've climbed?
Matt: You can make a nature check.
Liam: And do I need to make a extra roll to look for traps around this brazier?
Matt: If you want to enter the chamber, you can. You're too far away.
Marisha: Hey! Natural 20! That's a Gil 20!
Matt: As you take a moment, and think back to how far you've traveled path-wise and inclines and where you entered this titan and to where the city of Thar Amphala is placed upon its torso, you gather you're close to halfway through its torso, if not a little beyond it.
Marisha: If not a little beyond?
Sam: He's big.
Marisha: Okay, all right. Nipple level?
Matt: Sternum.
Marisha: The heartburn region? A little acid reflux?
Liam: We are the acid reflux.
Marisha: He has acid resistance against reflux.
Liam: Jesus Christ. Whoever that is.
Matt: You scoot up to the edge.
Liam: I don't want to go further than roughly 60 feet away from my sister.
Matt: Right. Which will put you right at the entryway to this chamber.
Liam: Yeah. So I will peep in from here.
Laura: I follow up and stand next to him. Did you want to go in?
Liam: I did.
Laura: Feel free.
Matt: So the marching order is the same? We got the twins up the front.
Taliesin: Yeah. I like this marching order.
Liam: Let this shit blow up in my face, so everybody hang back for a second. And I'm going to pitter patter in and look around the sconce, the room.
Laura: I think I was more stealthy than you a moment ago, so are you sure you want to be in front of me?
Liam: I love you anyway. Here I go.
Taliesin: He's better at blowing up than you are, dear.
Travis: Yeah. His heart beats once a century, so let him go.
Liam: Slower than this titan's footfalls.
Matt: All right. So as you enter the chamber, it's a small, about 20-foot radius square-shaped dark iron chamber with rounded corners. So it's about 40 feet wide from side to side, 20 feet from the center where the brazier is and the corners are slightly curved. It doesn't come to a straight, hard corner. There is no exit door currently visible; the chamber comes to an end. The room looks mostly bare, aside from an eight-foot-tall, five-foot-wide mirror coated in dust, framed in intricate gold and brass that sits across the chamber on the opposite side of where you entered.
Liam: Mirror in brass. So it's an iron room, right?
Matt: Iron room with a brass edge around this eight-foot tall, five-foot wide mirror. You can tell it's a mirror from this side. What little bit of light there is behind you, you can see your silhouette waving mirrored in the mirror.
Liam: So doorway, brazier, mirror.
Matt: Mirror. And then the rest of the chamber seems fairly empty.
Laura: And the brazier is complete dark?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: It's cold.
Taliesin: Oh no.
Laura: This is not good.
Liam: Look at his fake innocent face.
Sam: I think it's just a vanity.
Liam: Going to check for traps from right here to start. All right. That's totally fine. That's a jellyfish. That is a 17.
Matt: You begin to glance around the chamber, best you can, to take in the scenery. You notice small gold piece-sized buttons or pressure knobs set in the rounded corners of the chamber on the mirror side. One's embedded within the upper left and right corners and within the lower left and right corners.
Sam: Pressure knobs?
Matt: They're like little buttons that are gold piece-sized that are embedded in the upper right and left corners and the lower left and right corners.
Travis: Push them!
Liam: Stubby, come up here. I have a real bad history with pushing buttons.
Matt: You also notice very thin light piles of black residue or ash scattered in places across the floor.
Marisha: Called it. This is a fucking incinerator. I knew it! This feels like an incinerator. No? What? He's looking at me-- (nervous laughter)
Liam: (sighs) So we've got buttons.
Marisha: Or lasers.
Travis: Incinerator or lasers.
Marisha: Laser incinerator! Duh!
Travis: That was a great jump for me and my character.
Liam: If something stupid is going to happen here, I don't want it to be on me alone for once. So we've got an unlit brazier, there's mirror over there, and buttons, yeah.
Laura: Maybe the mirror is a door.
Liam: I thought that, as well.
Laura: Should we try to walk through it?
Taliesin: Maybe a second interrogation room and there's another room behind it, maybe?
Liam: Can we get your hub up here, please?
Taliesin: I am up here. I'm right here.
Liam: Jesus!
Laura: Hi, darling. I don't know why he didn't hear you. You used to be so good at that. Is the mirror leaning or is it on the wall?
Matt: It's on the wall.
Marisha: Is it curved? No. The whole room isn't curved. It's a square room.
Matt: It's a square room but the corners curve ever so slightly so there's no direct corner and in those curved corners on the side that the mirror's on, so the far side from you, there's these little buttons in the upper right and left corner and the lower left and right.
Laura: Can I reach down and touch the iron on the ground? The floor? Does it feel warm?
Matt: Mm. It's cold.
Liam: I catch her wrist. Just a second. You two do the thinking, all right? And I take a step into the room.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: What do I do?
Laura: Go see if you can walk through the mirror.
Taliesin: Tap the mirror.
Travis: Light the brazier!
Laura: We've done that before and we all exploded.
Travis: Yeah, but it's Vax.
Marisha: Wait. Before we do that, can I reach some of the ashy stuff?
Matt: If you enter the chamber to, yeah.
Marisha: Hand me some ash. I'll test it.
Liam: I scoop some ash. Lady of the Grey Hunt, here. I scoop up some ash and I pour it into her hands.
Marisha: Okay. I do a nature check. What does this ash feel like it's made out of?
Sam: Human bones.
Marisha: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. (groans)
Taliesin: Wow.
Laura: No. What is it? (groans)
Travis: Is it for real? You are lying!
Liam: Look at that face! You are not lying!
Marisha: Oh man. That's a one. Thanks, Gil. I blame Gil for his natural 20 in the balance of the universe.
Matt: It's light ash. You're not sure what the basis of what may have burned here. You see more of it gathered near where the brazier is.
Taliesin: Is it in piles that would be about human-amount of ash?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: All right. I'll Gil this one. Yeah, natural 20. That'll do.
Sam: Only ones and 20s tonight.
Liam: That's it, yeah. Just quarters. Heads up, heads down.
Matt: More of it seems to be around the base of the brazier, but you do see there are thicker traces at different places throughout the chamber.
Taliesin: It's organic ash?
Matt: You've dealt with different types of ash. The carbon appears to have been organic-based at some point.
Liam: I pull off my belt and say  Hello, Simon. Wake him up.
Matt: Okay. (slithering)
Liam: Hi. Gosh, it's been a while.
Laura: Simon, go through the mirror.
Liam: That's right. Go check out the mirror, Simon, all right? Off you go.
Travis: Are we still in the room?
Laura: No, nobody's in the room. He's the only one in the room.
Matt: (slithering) Scoots over and heads up to the mirror and presses up against it.
Liam: I dart back one step out of the room as it happens.
Matt: The snake trying to push up against the wall but half of its body sliding against the mirror before it eventually scoots off and lands. It tries again, pushing against the mirror and then eventually (sliding).
Taliesin: I hate to say this, but tap the button?
Liam: That's on the list. Simon, buddy. Crawl up the brazier. Wrap around it. Go up to the top.
Matt: The snake slithers around and makes its way. It's a cross-metal cage. There are inch wide metal bars that all curl up like a basket and then there are bars that cross around it to hold the shape. It looks like there are some long-burned, blackened pieces of wood that have been left for a long time. So Simon curls up into the brazier and curls up around the metal, comes around the top of the outer rim of it, rests there.
Liam: There's two buttons low down. Oh man. The nostalgia here. All right, buddy. I take two steps back away from the door. Buddy buds. Will you go push those low buttons in the room?
Matt: Which one?
Liam: There's two, right?
Matt: There's four on the opposite side.
Liam: There's two high up. And I don't think he can reach the high, because he doesn't stick to walls. Get the one over here on the left first.
Laura: What if we all have to push every button at the same time?
Liam: That's true. That could be.
Matt: Simon (slithering) moves over.
Liam: I lean over to Percy, I say  science!
Matt: Hits the button. (click) Right on the entrance of where you are in the chamber, slams closed. Iron metal now closes off that entranceway.
Taliesin: I'm going to touch the door.
Sam: And say goodbye.
Taliesin: Simon, we barely knew him. Is it warm?
Matt: It is beginning to get warm.
Taliesin: It's an oven. I'm looking for some sort some sort of cancel mechanism somewhere on the outside of the door.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: Is Vax in the room?
Liam: No, I took two steps back from the door.
Laura: No, nobody's in the room.
Taliesin: Let's say that investigation was somewhere around a seven? (laughter)
Matt: It's pretty solid at this point. The walls that lean in towards the ceiling there-- it is a perfect solid iron slab that has closed off at the entrance.
Travis: No problem. I'll get it down.
Laura: No!
Liam: Wait. Simon is technically a magical item, so I don't think he would be harmed by anything going on in there, so why don't we give it five minutes?
Marisha: And maybe it'll open again.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: Is there anything going on in the tunnel, on the outside of this door, where we are?
Laura: Coming up from behind us?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Temperature check, anything like that? Natural 20.
Taliesin: We have been gone so long!
Matt: Gone for two weeks and you guys can't find middle math. It's only extremes.
Liam: Yeah, we've had blue balls for two weeks, and it's all coming out now.
Matt: So as you guys glance back in the shadow of the tunnel behind you, nothing seems to be catching your eye. It's still dark. About two minutes in, what was once dark metal is now giving a slight orangish hue. You can feel the heat emanating from it.
Travis: There's no ash on the floor in the hallway that we are in right now, right?
Matt: I'd say, because of your perception check, as you glance around, there does not appear to be any ash.
Travis: I don't want that door to fucking open all of a sudden.
Matt: About five minutes go by as you guys are waiting. Eventually, the iron wall begins to descend. The dull orangish glow of it is still there. As it opens, a wave of heated air emerges from the chamber. You all have to immediately close your eyes. Some of you instinctually begin to step further back into the hallway. On the inside of the room, you can see the black iron interior of the chamber is also that same orangish glow. The mirror is unscathed. You all step back and watch and a few minutes pass as it slowly begins to cool off, the metal slowly darkening. You're too far away to look. You make a perception check to try and glance in?
Laura: Can't you call to him?
Liam: Simon? Come here, buddy.
Matt: There's no response.
Liam: (gasps) He's a magical item! Oh, but he could have turned back into a belt.
Taliesin: What's he going to say if you call to him? Was he going to say something?
Liam: He would come to me, Percy! Jeepers creepers! Perception check? 29!
Matt: You glance past where the button was that it hit. You see a limp belt left on the ground.
Liam: Okay, I'll get that in a minute.
Laura: When you go pick him up and put him back on your fucking waist.
Matt: Technically, since Simon's taken enough damage to revert to the belt form, Simon cannot turn back into a snake for the day.
Laura: How about that unseen servant?
Liam: I'm thinking, having no knowledge of magic, that we either want to somehow push all four of these buttons at once, as my sister said, or light this brazier, or both.
Laura: What about the brazier? Is it cold? Does it look like it's hot?
Sam: The brazier's the source of the furnace, I assume.
Travis: Are there still charred wooden pieces in the middle of it?
Matt: The pieces are still there, but it's black carbon. There's nothing in there that could burn. Whatever's been in there has been heated so much to the point--
Travis: It's not the source of the flame. Not for that much heat.
Marisha: If I was the person who designed this, why would I put a failsafe in here?
Liam: A way to get through that only the creator would know how to use?
Marisha: I feel like there's got to be another entrance because we can see another room, right?
Laura: There's no other room, it's a mirror. Oh, Keyleth, that's our reflection.
Marisha: No, I know that, but a lot of things have reflections.
Liam: Listen, all of you, or I, are going to be dead very soon. Are you sure you want to be that sarcastic right now?
Marisha: I go up to the mirror and check it out. It's cooled off enough, right?
Matt: Well, no. If you guys want to take a few minutes, you can wait until it cools off, if you want to.
Taliesin: Why don't we try pushing all four buttons at once?
Sam: Wait, before we do that, I'm going to enter the room and look around at the walls and the ceiling.
Matt: Okay, I take it you wait until it cools off. It takes about ten minutes or so for it to fully cool off, to the point where it's comfortable.
Sam: I'm looking for markings, indications of instructions, arrows, any hidden words--
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Look for Dwarvish. I'm aces with that.
Sam: Ooh, a lot. 29.
Taliesin: He's coming up with some bullshit.
Matt: Okay. Because the room is not fully cooled off, it's still warm in there, somewhat. You glance through. The ceiling and the walls all appear to be solid iron, and there's a layer of dust across a lot of it, a bit of ash from whatever previously may have been incinerated in here, long ago. As you look from the opposite side of the room into the reflection of the mirror, you see a very faint orangish glow in the reflection. It looks like, in the upper corner and the lower corner of the opposite side of the mirror as you're glancing off across to the other side. As you look over to the wall, of the room you're in, there's no glow.
Sam: Wait, so the wall that we came in through?
Matt: Let's say you enter the chamber and you move to the corner immediately to your right. You look in the mirror at an angle. You're now seeing the reflection of the corner opposite to you, right? Looking in that reflection, you can see this very faint orange glow in the upper and lower corner, but you glance over to the physical corner across from you, and it's not there.
Laura: What do your gnomish eyes see, Scanlan?
Sam: I think there's magical buttons in here and we need to find them? So I'm going to look in the mirror. I go to the opposite corner and do the same thing.
Matt: As you have this conversation and look back, those two glowing sigils are gone.
Sam: Even in the mirror?
Matt: Even in the mirror. What you saw earlier is now gone.
Travis: But they're revealed by heat.
Marisha: Where were they?
Sam: They were upper and lower corner, yeah.
Marisha: I walk over and I heat them with my heat hands.
Matt: Okay, so you take your hands and you put them up near there. As you put your hands on the wall, nothing seems to happen. As you glance through the reflection where she has her hands, that symbol seems to be appearing again.
Laura: What is the symbol of?
Sam: It's so far. I don't know. Can I see it?
Matt: It looks to be a simple triangular symbol, marked in a circle. Make an arcana check.
Sam: Oh yeah. 14 plus six, that's 20.
Matt: It's the most basic of arcane marks. It's a variation on a spell that basically is a mark that a certain enchanter or somebody places to mark as their own. However, this is meant to be a basic marker, a visual draw. There's no language behind it. It's just an indicator.
Sam: Keyleth, do that same thing to the lower one. Same marking?
Matt: As you head down there, the one above begins to slowly fade. As her hands go there, the symbol appears below.
Sam: Same symbol? Let's do that to the other walls and see if we can find other ones.
Matt: As you guys reverse, opposite sides, you go to the other corners, the ones that were immediately toward the entrance of where you walked in. Sure enough, two more symbols, mirroring where the buttons are on the far side corners.
Sam: So we push those? But there's a hidden button in there.
Travis: When you're a big fire, the walking thing--
Marisha: A fire elemental.
Travis: Sure. Do you take damage from fire? So you should be in here.
Laura: You should go in there, see if you can disengage the trap.
Liam: So you are impervious to being set on fire or burned?
Marisha: Well, when I'm a fire elemental.
Laura: Can you do that?
Marisha: Can I do it right now? Yeah. I just took a short rest, so yes, I can do that.
Travis: We also have an unseen servant.
Sam: So we're going to need four people.
Marisha: So what's the end goal? What am I doing?
Liam: Press all four buttons at once, although we've got at least three sharpshooters--
Sam: Not the buttons that we can see. What are these symbols here? I think they're buttons, as well.
Travis: It might be a depression on the wall or something.
Marisha: But what if the buttons are correlated with the symbols?
Taliesin: Let's try pushing all four buttons.
Travis: The regular buttons or the magic ones?
Liam: Please stand by.
Laura: I want to go look at where the symbol is and see if it's a fucking button.
Marisha: Yeah, if I touch the symbol, there's nothing there, right?
Sam: Was there anything there?
Matt: You put your hand on there. Nothing. The wall doesn't move.
Marisha: It's just a wall.
Travis: No depression, no toggle?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: I've got this, you guys. Oh! Minus two. 17!
Matt: 17. Grog, as you step up and glare down at the place where Keyleth had placed her palm, you get frustrated and (sighs heavily). As you exhale, it looks like a bit of soot and ash that had been slowly drifting in and filling this space flutters away. You can see two lines, parallel to each other, about an inch tall.
Travis: Fifth Element, anyone? Oh look! Breath of Grog reveals all! Look, behold! Two. Lines.
Laura: What did you do?
Travis: I breathed on the wall.
Sam: What do they do? What do these lines do?
Marisha: I do a quick Gust cantrip.
Matt: Across the parallel lines? All right. As the wind blows across it, a lot more of the soot and the ash blows around the area. It creates an open space where it pushes out to the edges and darkens areas of the floor and the vicinity around Keyleth. That edge of that corner, where you blew the Gust cantrip that Grog had unfurled, is now clear, the iron revealed. Nothing beyond the two.
Laura: I fly up on my broom and do it to the symbol up on the corner and go (blowing).
Matt: Okay. So up there. You blow on that one and it looks like--
Marisha: Hang on, I've got a paper ready.
Liam: How many people at home do you think have figured this out already?
Laura: We already figured it out!
Sam: Wait, you guys are blowing on the arcane symbols?
Laura: Yeah, to clear them out!
Travis: If you're looking at the door we came in, Grog blew on the lower right?
Sam: And that's two lines. Boom.
Matt: That would be lower right.
Travis: Two vertical lines.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: I'm in the corner above Grog.
Matt: That would be upper right.
Taliesin: I'm going to do bottom left.
Matt: All right, you blow, and you watch as the dust reveals. It's two more lines.
Laura: Two lines? Shit. I thought it was going to be another--
Taliesin: Bottom left. Getting out a hanky and (blows).
Liam: Did you use your ascot?
Taliesin: Yes, of course. That's what it's there for. The back of it.
Laura: The one clean spot left on it.
Matt: That one has four parallel lines.
Laura: Ooh! I'll go into the corner above Percy. There was a reflection there, too, right?
Sam: Blow! Laura, blow!
Laura: (blows) I looked straight at the camera as I did it. It was really awkward.
Matt: All right, that one has a single line.
Sam: Wait, so we've got one, two, two, four?
Laura: Is there one with three lines, or are there any more areas we saw a reflection?
Travis: What about above the door? It is opposite of the mirror, right? If one's a door, and the other one's a door?
Laura: Okay, I'll blow above the door.
Liam: And I'm going to start blowing around the mirror.
Laura: We all walk around going (raspberries).
Travis: Constitution check to see who passes out first?
Matt: What was that?
Taliesin: Does the mirror have a fancy frame?
Matt: It's not extremely intricate, but it looks like there's a brass or bronze frame around it.
Taliesin: Are any of these symbols mirrored in the frame itself? Is there a mirror of any of these symbols in the frame?
Matt: As you look in the actual frame itself, you don't see anything that matches the symbols.
Laura: What if these are numbers and the order you have to push the buttons?
Sam: Except we have two twos, and no three?
Laura: I know. One, two, four!
Taliesin: No, because you have to hit one, and then you have to hit the two together--
Sam: And then why not three? Okay, all right. Can we do a sweep for more?
Travis: Can I clear off the door area that we walked through?
Matt: So Grog, you go through, (rapid blowing). Blowing around. Okay. Make an investigation check.
Marisha: I take my mantle and start doing a--
Matt: You clear that archway very well, around the door. You do reveal Dwarven runes on the upper right corner, upper left corner, lower right, and lower left corner of the doorframe.
Travis: I only know Dwarven writing. I don't know runes.
Matt: Well, the runes are part of the Dwarven language.
Travis: The runes are part of the Dwarven language, so I know them.
Laura: Pike goes over and she helps you.
Travis: Help me, Pike! Yeah, I would like to decipher what these symbols mean.
Laura: "If you lift me up, I could see the ones above the door!"
Liam: "Yeah, the last time I wanted you to do it on your own, but I think we're pressed for time."
Travis: I hold her up to the upper left corner of the doorway.
Matt: Okay, so turning around, upper left corner. Okay. That one is the Dwarven rune that represents the number three.
Travis: Three. All right. Now, to the upper right-hand corner.
Matt: That is the number one.
Travis: Okay. I put her on the ground and I say, okay, look at the lower right-hand corner.
Matt: So lower right-hand corner would be a two.
Travis: And now the lower left-hand corner.
Matt: A four.
Laura: Oh, yeah! We know! That's the amount of times you have to push the button!
Taliesin: So one-one, two-two-two-two, three, four-four.
Sam: Possibly.
Laura: Wait, I think we reversed it.
Liam: How long does your unseen servant last?
Sam: Not too long.
Liam: How long? An hour? Ten minutes?
Sam: I'll look in my memory. One hour, but I have to be close to it. How big is this room?
Matt: It's a 20-foot radius from the center of the brazier, so it's 40 feet on each side.
Taliesin: Is our physicality of this map correct? If we show you this?
Liam: Well, I have this jar. It's an oil of etherealness. You could potentially be standing in here, but not be in here. Lasts an hour, though. Same time gap as your friend. You could stand in here and not be in here.
Sam: From the doorway to the mirror, is it less than 60 feet?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh, then I can be out of the door. Am I right with what I wrote down there?
Matt: All right, so this is the-- facing from the inside--
Sam: Yeah, from the brazier-- Frasier Crane. Looking at the door that we came in. Right?
Matt: I'm going to have to draw you one. I think you guys got confused on that one.
Laura: I think me and Travis got it right.
Sam: I think, Matt, you're wrong.
Travis: I have the same thing as Laura.
Liam: I'm pretty sure it's up up down down left right left right A B A B.
Laura: I hope we passed the test.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Did we get it right?
Matt: There, that's what you get! Sorry, I'm limited in my reach right now.
Marisha: I love that we all did something similar but all wrote something different. We're like, numbers, somewhere!
Matt: Yep, almost. Almost.
Marisha: Did you help us, or are you just saying "almost?"
Matt: I'm saying, looking back and seeing where the numbers lie and the runes in there, you have the correct configuration.
Laura: (victorious laughter)
Marisha: I think this is right. I think you have this. I think I have the right part of this and you have the right part of this.
Laura: We'll copy it and you can see what the fuck is correct.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: No, this is wrong. I'm just going to draw it. (counting)
Sam: Guys, Shadow of War! It's a great game by-- I don't know, who makes it? Warner Brothers!
Laura: Okay, so now we know the order to push the buttons and the amount of times to push the buttons.
Sam: Yes, so now we've just got to do it.
Travis: Should we check around the mirror frame to see if there's anything to dust off? The mirror frame?
Taliesin: I gave it a little bit of a rub.
Marisha: I'm going to go up and go tap-tap-tap on the mirror.
Matt: Okay. It taps.
Travis: Can I wipe off the edges around the frame and see if there's anything around the frame of the mirror, since I seem to be so good at this?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: Three. You smear a bit of ash, but eventually get some semblance of shine through. Nothing catches your eye.
Travis: It's clear. We found everything there is to find.
Marisha: Grog draws boobs on himself in the reflection out of the ash.
Sam: All right, should we leave the room and have Mr. Invisible start tapping buttons? All right, we'll do that.
Laura: We step just outside the door again and let his invisible servant push buttons.
Liam: (singing) Scanlan Man, Scanlan Man. Does whatever a Scanlan can. Makes a guy, pushes buttons, Scanlan Man-- I'm out.
Taliesin: Look out!
Liam: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Marisha: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Taliesin: (singing) Here comes the Scanlan Man.
Sam: Would a person who cannot fly be able to touch the top buttons?
Matt: Nope.
Sam: Shit.
Travis: Well, there's no saying that it will activate if we do it correctly.
Liam: Also, what about shooting the button or firing an arrow at a button?
Laura: Yeah but the buttons are on this side.
Taliesin: How high up are the buttons?
Matt: The buttons? The top are about ten feet up.
Taliesin: So if he had something that was-- if he had a mop, basically, he could probably tap it.
Laura: The buttons are on the side of the mirror, so we could shoot arrows at them.
Taliesin: But only if we're in there and then we don't need an unseen servant to do it.
Sam: Want to give him a pole or something?
Taliesin: Let's give him a stick.
Sam: Do we have a stick in the bag?
Travis: I have a lance.
Taliesin: Yeah, he has a lance.
Travis: It's almost broken.
Taliesin: My god, it will finally be useful one last time.
Liam: We do have three trammels.
Taliesin: No! We are not disengaging a smoke alarm with a fucking trammel. There is a limit!
Travis: You have a slightly splintered lance.
Laura: Okay. Let's hit buttons. Let's do it! Let's get through this room.
Taliesin: Let's explain to the unseen servant what he's supposed to do.
Sam: Matt, can he hold a lance, or is that violating some-- he's not allowed to hold weapons.
Matt: He can hold them. He can't attack; he cannot be a combatant. It can hold things for you.
Liam: He's like a Kids in the Hall character.
Matt: Kind of, yeah. You're not wrong.
Sam: I conjure an unseen servant, whom I will name Simon Two.
Taliesin: Electric Boogaloo.
Liam: Not cool, man, not cool.
Matt: All right. There's this brief shimmer, and you watch as a bit of ash displaces on the ground where two footfalls (landing noises).
Sam: All right, Simon Two, take this lance. We're going to go tell you what buttons to press over there, good speed-- good speed? (laughter)
Sam: Godspell. You'll be fine. Hope you don't like burning alive. So you tell me what to tell him, because I don't have the paper. Upper left? Upper right? What do we start with?
Marisha: It's this. Tell him to do this.
Laura: The reflection of that.
Sam: Okay, so two upper right. Two pokes. Oh, wait.
Laura: So the upper left corner from where we're looking.
Sam: Yes, we're going to go mirror image of this, so project that across the room.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh, that was the mistake.
Matt: Okay, so pressing the upper left twice.
Sam: Yes, mirror image of this, so upper left. Let's try that.
Matt: Heads over, holding the lance. You watch the lance wobble, and it misses a couple times, (clicking) hits the button, and it clicks inward. The lance is pulled back and the button presses back out outward into its position.
Sam: Any door?
Matt: No door.
Laura: We'll know if we push it again then we did it the wrong order.
Matt: Second time, (clicking) pulls off, the button depresses.
Taliesin: All right, keep going.
Sam: So below it, two presses.
Laura: In the corner, bottom corner.
Sam: Just like your name, Simon  two.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: Okay, opposite corner, up. One press.
Laura: Upper right-hand corner.
Matt: (clicking)
Sam: And then below that, bottom corner. Four presses.
Matt: (clicking) (laughter)
Matt: The fourth one hits. There's a moment of pause, and the mirror shimmers faintly. You watch as, almost like a stone thrown into the middle of a still pond, begins to ripple from the center, and as it ripples, each ripple seems to fade, until eventually the five-foot-wide mirror is now an oval portal that leads to darkness behind it.
Laura: Let's go in!
Marisha: I told you there was a room behind the mirror.
Travis: Yeah, let's go. Hurry! We don't know how long it will stay open for.
Sam: Simon Two is coming with us.
Matt: Okay. You hear the faint footfalls of sound behind, and Trinket takes a moment to try and squeeze through this small entranceway. Trinket had a hard enough time getting through the incline. (moans) Into the necklace. You make your way through the opposite side, and as you all step through, the portal remains open for at least a moment.
Laura: Hey, we did it, guys.
Sam: We beat a door.
Travis: We beat a door.
Marisha: Guys, it took 111 episodes, but we bested a door.
Liam: The last episode of the third campaign will be a door that we do not open.
Matt: So the darkness you step through leads into a ten-foot-wide hallway of similar dwarven stone. Same slightly angled hallways about ten feet tall or so, about five or six foot wide. You get a few steps in and about 20 or 30 seconds after you guys make your way in, the mirror portal behind closes up.
Liam: Can we see?
Marisha: Can you see through it?
Matt: Through the mirror?
Liam: I meant where we are. Are we in pitch black?
Matt: You're in pitch black, but you guys with darkvision can see there is a staircase not too far, maybe ten feet from where you stand into this next hallway.
Travis: Iron stairs? Stone stairs?
Matt: Stone stairs.
Liam: I've got a dagger out.
Matt: All right, lights up briefly and you get a little bit of a vision beyond that, and it's gradual stone steps. They're not too wide; they're made for dwarven gait, so there are many steps that are relatively shallow.
Travis: These are dwarven steps that are relatively shallow.
Sam: We can see it, Grog.
Liam: Pike says, "That's actually right".
Laura: Is there any traps?
Matt: You're welcome to search for traps.
Liam: And I'm going to scoot 40 feet up the stairs and look as I go for traps. One. I'm taking it, but I'm still going and looking for traps.
Matt: You do have reliable talent, don't forget.
Liam: Does that oversee ones? Because I've been counting ones as ones for a long time.
Matt: The reliable talent as a rogue specifically says any roll lower than a ten you take as a ten.
Sam: Any roll?
Matt: Well, not any roll. Any ability check he has to make.
Liam: Okay, well, we wrongly assumed that ones and 20s were king, but no.
Laura: So he rolled way better than me because I rolled a ten.
Liam: That's an 18. My one is an 18 now.
Matt: Yeah, because that's one of the cool things about rogues. You guys make your way up about 45, 50 or so feet up the stairway, you keeping an eye out, no traps, nothing catches your eye as iffy or strange, and the stairs now switch back into another set. It's a small landing and then it continues upward.
Liam: Okay, but I'm only going to go 40 feet in advance. That's like ten fucked rolls of mine from the past 30 games! Anyway, I love it.
Marisha: So it's a big 180, going right up?
Matt: Yeah, it's a switchback. The staircase ascends, then there's a landing, and it continues upward and around.
Laura: Do we hear anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Taliesin: I'll join in that perception.
Matt: So you're joining them up the staircase?
Taliesin: I'm behind. You know, the standard--
Matt: All right, so you guys are keeping up.
Marisha: Did you fuck the roll, too? Oh, what the fuck!
Taliesin: I got a 25.
Matt: Seriously, welcome back after two weeks and people just cannot-- wow.
Liam: But do you remember when we were at home and we'd go six weeks without playing and we'd spend 45 minutes trying to remember what we did, how the rules worked, what our names were, who you were.
Taliesin: Vex is right.
Travis: 25, you said?
Taliesin: 25.
Matt: 25. Okay. It's hard to discern what shifting in the distance is not the rumbling from the ever-occasional titan footfalls, but nothing seems to catch your attention. Occasionally, you hear dislodged rocks and stones clacking across the stone floor and the steps, and every now and then you catch a stone or two fall past and eventually come to rest either near or below you. You continue up the switchback stairs and lead into a third switchback that continues upward.
Liam: 40 feet in advance.
Marisha: We are following behind.
Laura: Are you looking for traps as you go, brother?
Liam: I am. That is an 18, anyway.
Marisha: I still have my hands guiding Percy, our blind human.
Matt: Leading the old man forward.
Taliesin: (old man voice) Where's Steven?
Marisha: (laughs) Where's Steven?
Matt: You do not find any other traps. There's no other issues that worry you upon this climb. You do eventually come to the top of the third switchback stairway and it leads you into a slight curved cavern. The stairs stop and it leads into a continuation of the dwarf-like hallway structure that you had below, but it is curving around now, in sections. I would say, as opposed to a gradual curve, the design in the structure here has a very rigid, geometric shape, so the curvature is in sections.
Liam: Yeah, I appreciate it as I go, and I look for traps.
Matt: All right, go for it.
Liam: Love it. That's an 18.
Matt: Okay. Coming around the edge  no traps, no plates. Nothing catches your attention. However, this tunnel comes to an end, and it opens up into a larger crevasse than the one that you previously saw that held a number of city buildings of the remains of Thomara. It looks to be about 100 to 120 feet tall, you assume, from the bits of the stalactites that you can see, barely reaching the edge of your visual range. Very faint bit of light here, bioluminescent fungus in a dull orangish color that dots the edges of this interior chamber.
Liam: And is it like where I killed that motherfucker? They were built into the cliff face, right?
Matt: Yes. This one is larger than the one you were in before, and you can see just beyond your visual range, a number of these buildings, partially crumbled in some places, some still standing obstinately against the ever-shifting interior of the titan's form, the chamber curling upward as the ceiling crawls higher and higher just beyond your visual range, and you can faintly see the images of dozens of thin bridges that weave over themselves across different levels, up into the higher portion.
Liam: I want to confirm an intuition and use my last Divine Sense and feel undead.
Matt: Okay, what's the range on that one?
Liam: 60 feet.
Matt: 60 feet? You do not sense any undead within the 60-foot range.
Marisha: I think we're in the lungs. I think we're in its chest cavity.
Liam: Speaking into the earrings; they're all behind me. I think we're in a more populous place with the undead cannibals, know what I mean? There's a very large cavern in here and a lot of room.
Taliesin: I'd be grateful if anyone got a sample of that bioluminescent fungus.
Marisha: I can get that. I'm interested.
Laura: Do you want me to fly up and get some?
Liam: We're on a schedule here.
Marisha: Well, if it's on the way. We have to go that way.
Laura: We have to go up, right? Does it look like there's openings in the ceiling?
Matt: Well currently you're the only one who's stepped into this entrance to look up, the rest of you are now exiting into the chamber.
Liam: I'll wait, obviously. Nothing's going to explode on my friends, so they catch up with me.
Matt: Okay, so they're all behind you now where this entrance is, and as you look past it, this hallway that you're entering, it looks like there was a doorway here. There was some sort of hinge on the edge that held a door that had since been broken or toppled forward. You can see pieces of the door that once held this entranceway, and a number of the buildings immediately to the right and left. That's where you stand, what do you want to do?
Laura: Does it look like there's any footprints coming in and out of the doorway that we came from?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Travis: Can I look for a doorknob or a keyhole?
Liam: Everything we were told is that this place is full of undead cannibals.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Not in a long time.
Travis: Is there shattered remnants of the door?
Matt: Yeah, you see a couple of shards here and there--
Travis: Any doorknob or a keyhole that's on the ground or anything?
Matt: Make an investigation check. Lot of investigation checks today.
Travis: Two.
Matt: You scramble about and find a couple of pieces that might be, but no, it's just more stone.
Marisha: Can I see any stairs carved in the side, in the walls, trying to head up to this-- is that what you just checked?
Laura: No, that's what I was about to look for, too.
Liam: Is there any movement, because there's bioluminescent shit on the walls in here, so there's a little bit of light, right? Yeah. 26.
Matt: 26. As you glance about-- once again, your vision, because there is very little light in here and the very, very faint bits of fungus in the distance that give you a sense of the shape of this entire chamber. There isn't enough light for you to make out any shape beyond the exterior of your visual range, so you can't really tell.
Liam: A second thing I want to look for is what other exits from this gigantic cavern. Ways through, up. Yeah, you looked, but I didn't look.
Matt: Let me finish what I was saying first.
Travis: Roll! Roll again.
Matt: But based on the size of this chamber and the bits of what small elements of structures that you can see of the architecture within, this definitely appears to be more of the heart of the city of Thomara when it was once at its ancient height. You can see at the very edge of your visual range a cracked central fountain that is empty and dry, and you see, just beyond your range, the exterior of a large temple-like building that rises out of the ability to see any more of its height and structure.
Taliesin: Temple.
Matt: But like I said, you guys are still standing at the entrance to this cavern.
Marisha: What about the temple? Why?
Sam: Want to fly through here? Can we fly?
Liam: I don't think we want to stay here--
Sam: I know, that's why we just fly through.
Liam: Find another exit, yeah, but where?
Travis: I'd like to see the temple, if I can.
Sam: What are you talking about?
Travis: Well look, all right, my gloves--
Laura: Keep your voice down.
Travis: (whispering) My gloves come from the heart of a ruined primordial titan. So if maybe they harvested pieces of my gloves, and it's in a temple, I don't know, you smart people could do something with that.
Liam: Right, what's your plan? You expect us to come up with a plan to explain why your gloves are connected to that temple, and you're going to get what? A Mighty Morphin Power Ranger bonus for doing so?
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Are your Titanstone Knuckles exalted yet?
Travis: Yep. They're just buzzing.
Liam: Yeah, are they still dildoing on your fingers?
Marisha: Are they buzzing more?
Travis: Are they humming more?
Matt: Doesn't appear to have changed.
Travis: Nope, just humming.
Marisha: Step two steps closer.
Travis: Two steps closer to the temple.
Marisha: Do they appear to be buzzing more?
Travis: Are they appearing buzzing more?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Ooh! 19.
Matt: Not bad. Nope.
Taliesin: Is the temple on the way? Does it make sense to cross through the city, or does it make sense to fly up?
Liam: We're moving towards Vasselheim now. I'm negative on our chances of dealing with this before Vasselheim, but that's the goal, right?
Taliesin: We've got some time, and I feel like this city is an opportunity to find some more advantages.
Travis: We are also looking for the Sword of Kas. What's if it's in the temple?
Sam: Why would Vecna keep the thing that could kill Vecna near Vecna?
Liam: I'm pulling Percy aside. I hear you, but this is a city that has existed here for a long time. Vecna didn't create this city. Vecna doesn't own these people. This is a fucking mountain that existed and now they're going for a ride. What do these people have to do with Vecna?
Taliesin: It's not a city that just existed.
Liam: No?
Taliesin: This is a giant primordial beast that people inhabited. God only knows what existed in here.
Marisha: Yeah, but as we've already seen from the other tomb, it's already been heavily, heavily plundered.
Liam: And Vecna's just a user. This place was just sitting there. He lifted it up and took it away. These assholes don't have anything to do with--
Travis: Why did he choose this?
Marisha: How far away is the temple? Do we know? Can we football range guess it?
Matt: I'd say, because you guys have darkvision of 60 feet?
Taliesin: If gods really understood how this world worked, this would not be happening right now.
Matt: It's at about the 50, 55 foot areas where the wall begins, then it vanishes beyond that.
Liam: Percy, this shitbird has appeared like three times wherever we were.
Laura: Well, he's not going to be able to do that right now because I've got a fucking ring.
Taliesin: He doesn't necessarily know this place as well as--
Marisha: Hang on. How long have we been in here, versus how far have we been from Vasselheim? Because we are on a time crunch.
Travis: 200 miles away once we entered is how far away we are from Vasselheim. 200 miles. With steps of?
Taliesin: What was the average land speed of a laden undead?
Matt: You've been within the titan for, I'd say, roughly three and a half hours, maybe.
Liam: Yeah, he's 110 miles out from Vasselheim, at this point.
Travis: We have time to check the temple.
Sam: All right, let's swoop in and swoop out.
Marisha: Super fucking fast!
Taliesin: I'm not even saying look in it, let's take a look at what it--
Laura: Did I see any stairs?
Matt: You do not see any staircases within a 60-foot radius of where you're standing.
Taliesin: We might be harder to spot if we stay on the ground for now, anyway.
Marisha: I just want to say, we gave you guys the other temple, in which you found your stupid waistband, but we got really fucked up from it! Everything has a consequence and a price and shit. Nothing is free.
Laura: I'm going to cast Pass Without a fucking Trace. It's my last Pass Without a Trace, but I'm afraid--
Travis: No, don't do it.
Laura: What if we bring out an entire fucking city of undead dwarves upon us?
Marisha: Let me do it. I have Pass Without a Trace and one more 2nd-level spell left. I'll do it. Save yours.
Liam: I'm also going to put something on the table here: we're trying to save Vasselheim, but we're also trying to save the world. We might not be able to do this without recharging before Vasselheim.
Taliesin: I'm aware.
Sam: You want to go to sleep in this undead city?!
Liam: No, but we're trying to save the world, not just a city.
Sam: So sacrificing Vasselheim so that we can feel better about a fight?
Liam: What if we lose the fight Scanlan? Then who fucking cares? Vasselheim is gone. Westruun is gone. Kaylie is gone. Everything's fucking gone if we fuck this up!
Sam: Well, let's stay on the path and see how long it takes.
Marisha: How about this? Hold. Wait! We still don't know how to get up there, right?
Sam: Is that purple eyeliner?
Marisha: Yeah, do you like it? Thank you. It's a little metallic. Thank you, I bought it while I was waiting for--
Travis: Oh my god!
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: Okay. I hate to say split the party, but what if we split the party? What if a few of you check out your fucking temple, and then the rest of us try to figure out a way to get up.
Travis: I'm cool. I'll vote for a temple party.
Marisha: Temple party. Who else is on temple party?
Sam: They need somebody who can help them in there.
Liam: I hate the idea, but I'm the stealthiest motherfucker in this room.
Taliesin: And then you three on the carpet, you on the broom.
Travis: I need the carpet.
Marisha: So wait, just the two of you are going to go check out the carpet?
Laura: Vax is going in with you.
Sam: I feel like one person with magic should go with them. I'll go with them.
Taliesin: We're all ear-pieced.
Marisha: Okay, so Grog--
Liam: Everybody but Keyleth.
Sam: No, it's Keyleth, Vex, and Pike are going searching. The boys are going in the temple, and the girls are going searching.
Marisha: Okay, cool, I'm on board.
Taliesin: This is in no way, by the way, an amazing mirror of that one time underneath Kraghammer. They're just going to find another Clarota.
Liam: The boys all die. The girls go to glory.
Laura: I want to kiss Percy before he goes. Don't die in this stupid temple.
Taliesin: I will not die in this stupid temple.
Sam: I'm going, too.
Taliesin: I slap him in the face.
Laura: Right on, Scanlan. Sorry, Percy.
Matt: Who's traveling in what group?
Laura: Girls are going to look for stairs, the boys are going in the stupid temple.
Liam: I yank the druid in for a kiss.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Oh wait, shit. Your fucking ring.
Laura: Fuck! My fucking ring! We can't split the party.
Taliesin: Okay, can't split the party. We all go looking for the stairs. Oh, you asshole, stop it! (laughter)
Laura: He was really excited about it!
Matt: I was waiting on that.
Laura: Oh my god, he was so excited about it.
Sam: All right, into the temple. Come on, let's just fucking go to the fucking temple.
Matt: I was like, you guys literally had this conversation an hour ago, but okay.
Taliesin: Whatever we do, we can't split the party (fast-forward noise). Okay, we're going to split the party.
Travis: Sam saved our asses.
Taliesin: That was Cabin in the Woods shit.
Liam: 40 feet in advance, Vax walks ahead of the group, hating himself. Here we go.
Matt: Go for it. What are you doing, you're checking for traps?
Liam: I'm checking for enemies hiding.
Matt: So as you push forward--
Laura: We're stealthed, we're Pass Without a Traced.
Matt: Okay, then roll some stealth, guys.
Laura: She Pass Without a Traced us.
Matt: Right, then roll some stealth.
Sam: Oh, we're all rolling stealth?
Liam: 34.
Sam: 25.
Taliesin: 26.
Marisha: 26.
Laura: 39.
Travis: Natural one.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Sam: He's so excited about that temple.
Laura: Natural 20 for Pike! Oh wait, she gets disadvantage.
Matt: She has the boots that make it not at disadvantage.
Taliesin: First time ever.
Liam: But that's a lot of good.
Laura: So much good for one shitty--
Matt: You begin to push forward past the cracked fountain, heading ahead of everyone, keeping an eye out for what's ahead of you. The high walls of the temple-like structure begin to reveal themselves, standing ominous over the debris-strewn streets with shattered carts and bone fragments. The bone fragments faintly quaking beneath every footfall of the walking mountain that you currently are walking through. You see long-decomposed dwarvish bodies brutalized beyond reanimation lying scattered across the broken street paths ahead of you, deep grooves marking the splintered bone. A tangled network of partially ruined catwalks begin to reveal themselves above you, carved from the mountain, contains a ghostly image of a multi-level metropolis long fallen. You, make a perception check.
Liam: 29.
Matt: 29. You can see, as soon as you get to where the fountain is, the center of the street ahead of you. Dozens of slow shifting creatures moving throughout the streets and rubble of crumbling structures. You can see now, many of the undead citizens of the catacombs are now wandering, shaken awake by the lumbering titan that now carries them within. You also see a very faint blue pulsing glow emanating from one of the windows of the temple.
Liam: Can we put the goliath on the carpet so he doesn't kick something or be himself?
Laura: We don't know that he rolled shittily.
Liam: I know that, but he's a big, blundering mother fucking asshole when he wants to be--
Travis: On the chain. Literally on the text chain.
Matt: Which, as you're saying this, you hear a (clattering), and you glance over real fast and watch as Grog is walking by and the edge of his-- which weapon do you have attuned right now? You have the Blood Axe? The Blood Axe hits the edge of a large dwarven statue that had fallen off at a corner angle and is currently being held by a small barrel, and as the axe hits it, it shifts (crashing) and rolls and comes to a rest for a second with this clattering, grinding sound. Parts of it chip and break, but most of it remains strong and sturdy upon impact. At which point, you see at the edge of your visual range, about seven of the wandering creatures go (raspy groan) and begin slowly slinking their way in the direction of the noise.
Sam: So a rock just fell?
Travis: A big statue just fell.
Sam: And is in pieces?
Matt: Parts of it are broken. It's still pretty sturdy.
Taliesin: Let's try and serpentine around and see if we can trace back.
Liam: And they're to the right or the left or ahead of us?
Matt: They're ahead of you.
Laura: Do they look like they saw us?
Liam: Go left. Jenga, jenga, jenga. Can we put Grog on the carpet now?
Taliesin: Yep.
Marisha: We're trying to go up, right?
Sam: No, we're trying to go towards the temple.
Laura: Towards that pulsing light.
Liam: We've got a little bit of business, a little bit of activity ahead of us, so we want to curve to the left.
Travis: All right, we move accordingly.
Matt: All right. So you guys move along the left and curve around the side. As you begin to move along the edge, you watch as about eight of these mostly-skeletal dwarvish corpses begin to shamble in the direction of where the noise came from. You can see elements of their long-mummified skin pulled tight against elements of the rib cage and the skull. Bits of chipped teeth, now broken against whatever things it's attempted to chew on its long un-life. As they move past, two of them glance over in the direction of Grog, and then all of them shift over in the direction and begin rushing forward in your path.
Liam: What's the distance?
Matt: At this point, they're probably about 50 or so feet from where you are.
Liam: Oh shit!
Laura: We don't want to make too much noise. I'm going to shoot a couple.
Travis: We could just go straight up.
Laura: There's only eight of them. We can take eight undead.
Liam: Pickle walks forward and takes a knee and waits with her holy symbol of Sarenrae, waiting for them.
Laura: I take two of them by surprise. That's auto-crit.
Liam: Vax does the same, watching his badass sister, and Pike waits to turn whatever's left of them.
Laura: Yeah, they're super-silent arrows.
Liam: So what happens first?
Matt: All right. She's preparing for it, right?
Liam: Yeah. She's waiting until she sees them.
Matt: Oh, well she also has darkvision of 60 feet.
Liam: So she's waiting until they're within range of her holy abilities.
Matt: What's the radius on that one?
Liam: That's a good question, because I'm a rogue paladin. (sighs) Goddamn it.
Matt: That's all right.
Liam: What if I look in the sorceror rules?
Matt: Nope. 30 feet.
Liam: 30 feet. So she's waiting for the twins to do their work and anything that's left over she's going to scatter.
Matt: Okay. All right. So as she holds position--
Laura: So it's auto-crit?
Matt: They know you're there. It's not a surprise. There's as threat, and they're rushing. But you do have advantage on the hits because they don't see you.
Laura: Well great, that's great. 20?
Matt: That definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Oh, the other one super-duper hits. It's a 19 plus 14.
Liam: 25, 31, natural 20.
Matt: Okay. All right. So go ahead and roll damage on those. Are you shooting two different skeletons or one each?
Liam: I'm after my sister. She talked before I did.
Laura: I'll see how the first arrow hits?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 14. Oh, I didn't Hunter's Mark. Whatever. 14, 15, 16. Two lightning damage. Do I add anything? Sneak attack!
Taliesin: Been a while.
Laura: How do we D&D? Plus ten sneak attack.
Matt: Okay. So the first skeleton, the arrow hits it and the torso explodes behind with ribs shattering and scattering across the stonework, its body falling and collapsing to the ground.
Laura: I hit another one.
Matt: Yes, you do.
Liam: Oh, and we go first, so it's advantage.
Laura: 14 plus four lightning damage. And that is plus eight.
Travis: 26.
Matt: 26. This one right behind it, its jaw unhinged slightly. Its tongue made of this slick rotting material that dangles through the hole in the bottom of the jaw. Comes around the corner, and you watch as part of its head explodes off one side from the secondary arrow, taking out what remains of the center of its skull, and the body crumples to the ground. Two skeletons down.
Liam: Sneak attack hits the first time we connect, right?
Matt: Yeah. You don't have to roll damage for that one.
Laura: Oh. Sorry, I did sneak attack on the second arrow.
Matt: Well, you can do sneak attack once per round.
Laura: Okay. I did eight damage too much.
Matt: It was still enough.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: You don't have to roll damage for sneak attack.
Liam: So then that one's gone?
Matt: A third skeleton now is ruined. You hit it with the arrow in the middle of the spinal column, and it folds on itself.
Liam: Okay. So paladin action-action and my bonus action. So that's the first of three. The last one's the one that was a critical hit so the second one goes onto the next whole skeleton. It's just an eight.
Matt: Okay. This one the arrow slides into the side of the skull, and it keeps coming forward towards Grog.
Liam: Okay. And then the last critical hit, which is Whisper again, because it bamfed back, is two plus eight is ten. Two and three. It's not that much. It's 15 total.
Matt: Okay. And that one does finish it. So that's three skeletons down. Grog, I want to to individually roll an initiative check for me.
Travis: Natural 20. With Gil's dice.
Matt: So as you guys are watching this happen, the other five rush in to close the gap, but you are at the ready, and you get to strike before they do.
Travis: Nice. Am I hitting them? Yeah, Okay. Reckless, great weapon master. 31 for the first one.
Matt: That hits.
Travis: Okay, cool.
Matt: Your minimum damage will kill them. So as the first one comes up towards you, you swing up. As you slam into it, you watch as its bony body blows up against the side of the nearby stone building and then scrapes to the ground.
Travis: Can I use the other strike on another?
Matt: Yes, you can.
Travis: Reckless great weapon. That'll hit. That's like 30.
Taliesin: If there's anything left on Grog by the end of this, I'll try to swipe them off with my sword.
Travis: 32.
Matt: All righty. So two more detonate on this point. So there's three left. They're closing in on Grog. Does Pike want to take her turn?
Travis: We might want to save that Turnt Undead.
Laura: No, I think we should save.
Liam: I've already said it, but she's whispering to me to hold. She's half of Pike right now. You're half of Pike right now.
Taliesin: I'd like to pop in and see if I could take a couple--
Matt: Make an initiative roll.
Laura: Don't shoot, Percy.
Taliesin: I'm not; I'm going to use my sword.
Liam: Pike holds, breathing hard, looking at them coming on.
Taliesin: 16.
Matt: Yeah, that beats them by one. So yeah, as the three remaining ones start charging in towards Grog--
Taliesin: I'm going to run in, draw the silvered sword, and take some swipes.
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: Let's take three swipes right out of here.
Laura: Pike can use her mace on anything left in that area.
Taliesin: That's one natural 20, one natural 19. Do I crit on a 19 with the sword?
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind. And a two. But that might be enough, because I have a really high-- that's a 15 as my lowest to hit. Does a 15 hit?
Matt: 15 does hit. Yes.
Taliesin: So the 15 is-- That's 14 piercing damage to the first one with a silvered sword.
Matt: Okay. You rush up and you carve through the first skeleton, and it breaks on the ground in front of you.
Taliesin: Number two is 13 points of damage to the second one.
Matt: Okay. The second one, you bring the blade down into the skull and cleave it in half. You watch as part of its skull breaks off to the side and the jaw falls to the ground and the rest crumbles in place.
Taliesin: I twirl around and take my third wonderful pirouette attack, which is 20 points of damage.
Matt: Okay, and as the final one lunges forward, in a fervent-- strangely faster than you expect for a skeletal undead, it begins to accelerate towards Grog. And with that, you take the blade and take the head right off at the neck, and it falls and crumples to the ground.
Marisha: So it's like 28 Days Later zombies?
Travis: 28 Days Later, they run.
Marisha: He said that they were fast.
Matt: Well, the last one-- it was flavor.
Marisha: Just wanted to make sure they weren't special.
Matt: Okay. As you finish the fray and hold yourself, you wait and wait. You do not hear or notice any more advancing undead from that direction.
Travis: Okay, how about I don't move and somebody with flying ability go to check out that blue glowy window?
Taliesin: We have to stick together.
Laura: Is the glowy window within 60 feet?
Taliesin: No, it's far.
Travis: When we were at the opening, we were 50 to 60 feet away.
Matt: The temple where you guys were at, at the time was 50 feet away from you, but you would have crossed the other side of the hall. So now it's about 100 feet away from you. At this distance, you can see it's a round, almost cylindrical building, Colosseum-esque. And there's a small square window about every 25 to 30 feet. And it's big. It's large, but you can see that faint glow between multiple windows from this distance.
Travis: So should we fly up to that window?
Taliesin: I think it'd be safer to stay on the ground level and sneak. Because if we're the air, they are going to see us.
Travis: Let's do it.
Marisha: And we still have Pass Without a Trace, so let's go.
Laura: Yes, we do. She cast it.
Matt: All right, now that this brief combat has finished, those who took place in it, which would be you, Vax, Grog, and Percy have to remake your stealth checks.
Laura: You're like, "Gladly!"
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: What about Pike? Because she just knelt down. She didn't really fight.
Matt: She stepped out of her stealth. She was making herself visible.
Laura: My natural 20 for Pike, wasted!
Taliesin: 23.
Liam: We still have Pass Without Trace?
Marisha: Yes. I didn't do anything.
Travis: 26.
Marisha: Keeping that concentration.
Taliesin: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Marisha: (singing) Concentration. Concentration.
Liam: You're the doctor! Keep your patients on the run!
Laura: 30 for Pike. 29 for me.
Matt: All right. You guys begin to slowly make your way along the left wall of this large cavern.
Liam: 37, by the way.
Matt: Good to know. As you slowly move through the shadows, dodging through open doorways and through windows, trying the best you can to stay out from the center thoroughfare of this opening, you see more and more of these undead. Dozens, maybe even a hundred have crossed your path at the perimeter of your visual range and you can see in the catwalks above too, with the faint bit of the orange glow, occasionally shapes breaking across the orange. This entire cavern is swarming.
Laura: (whispering) Do we still have the thing?
Sam: Oh, the filter? The censer?
Laura: Do we have it in the Bag of Holding?
Taliesin: We also have the herbs.
Laura: What if we use it? What if we use it and it just repels them?
Taliesin: When it's time. We don't have a lot of it.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a very small amount.
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Taliesin: Let's prepare it, and when it's time--
Liam: Is it ready to go, though?
Marisha: Yeah it's dried. I spent that time. I spent time during the break.
Taliesin: It's just burning the herbs, though. We don't need the censer. Just hold it in your hands.
Liam: Do we have any sense of where we started in this giant cavern? Or are we totally fucking turned around?
Matt: No. I mean you have a decent sense. You are maybe 100 to 150 feet from where you began. Because you've been moving slowly. Staying stealthily, you're moving very carefully and very slowly and judging by the shape of the cavern and where you are currently, you're about halfway through it, or close to halfway.
Taliesin: It's good that we didn't go on the catwalk.
Matt: The temple's on the opposite side of the chamber.
Liam: Oh! All the way on the other side. I thought it was central.
Matt: I'm sorry. When you entered the entrance, the temple was to the front and to the right of you. You guys curved around the left, on the other side of it, keeping a view on it so you could see it from across the way. Are you making your way across to the temple?
Liam: So it's pressed against the opposite wall of this big place?
Sam: Are the undead all around the temple?
Matt: Further in. Nothing directly around the outside of the temple. So you guys curve around the entrance where you came and slowly make your way towards where the temple emerges from the rock wall. About a third or so of its exterior wall is actually built into the side of this cavern, and the large cylindrical-like Colosseum temple structure curves outward. You can see as you get closer to it, there's maybe the three floors to it but edges of the top wall have crumbled inward and you can see areas where it looks like it's sustained some physical damage or eroded over time. You eventually make your way around the outside wall of the temple to one of the first doorways, and it is an archway, maybe six feet tall and about four feet wide. Very simple. This is an old temple.
Liam: Is that light you talked about coming from one specific source, or all over the place? Every window.
Travis: Is there a story?
Matt: It looks to be coming from the base.
Liam: From down below.
Laura: Can we see in one of the windows?
Matt: You can look inside. Make a perception check.
Sam: Are there any bone laying around?
Matt: Plenty.
Sam: I am going to pick up two bones, give them to Simon Two, and tell him to go across the street, 50 feet away from us, and wait there in some building. Hold these bones.
Matt: You watch as two bone shards slowly glide over, then stand there.
Laura: 34.
Matt: Okay. As you pull up to the window and glance down, you immediately look inside the temple, and you see about 30 or so silhouettes of shambling dwarven corpses all standing inside the base floor of this temple. You see the silhouettes and shapes because they are all faintly outlined from the source of this blue light. You see a small, baseball-sized, bluish crystal that is resting, not in the perfect center of the temple but somewhere in the open middle floor area, and it looks like these 30 undead are surrounding it, and standing.
Sam: Smash and grab. You could go in there and get that thing, be out before they even saw you in there.
Taliesin: Also, have your unseen servant make a bunch of noise and have them all--
Marisha: Be a distraction?
Laura: Yeah, but making any kind of noise would draw large crowds.
Taliesin: We can have the unseen servant pick it up.
Marisha: How far away can he be, though?
Sam: He's 50 feet away, right now, and he's waiting to make noise.
Taliesin: What if he were to go in and get it himself?
Sam: He could.
Travis: He is invisible, isn't he?
Sam: He could go and pick it up and come right back with it.
Laura: But first don't tell him to come right out, tell him to like walk a little bit to see if they follow the light.
Liam: But what are our options if that doesn't work?
Sam: If he picks up the crystal and it doesn't work, or it doesn't move?
Liam: I want to do that. If that doesn't work, I can click the boots, and I can be there in a heartbeat and run, but what do we do next?
Sam: We need an escape plan, right? How many can fit on the carpet?
Liam: This goes back to my conversation with you, which is: are we going to find a pocket and rest?
Taliesin: Yes, but not here.
Liam: Agreed, but we're talking about Vasselheim, and is damage to Vasselheim a sacrifice needed to be ready to do what's necessary?
Travis: If he destroys Vasselheim, he does his miracle, his display of power, and he will be even stronger. That is not an option.
Taliesin: If we were to be clever, if we're at the edge of Vasselheim, the Vasselheim forces will be distracting his forces, so we'll have less to deal with, so we want this fight to happen at the edge.
Liam: So we're talking about no rest. I'm not talking about a short rest.
Taliesin: There will not be a long rest, I don't think.
Laura: There might be.
Liam: Not without him spilling into Vasselheim.
Marisha: I've been very conservative with what I've been doing for a reason.
Travis: I don't think a long rest is in the cards.
Taliesin: I've only burned one thing that requires a long rest.
Marisha: I agree with Grog. We can't sacrifice having him gain all of those followers, because then the only option would be murder a lot of his followers, which I'm not really comfortable with.
Travis: And he may be too strong at that point.
Sam: We don't need to discuss this now. We need to get the crystal and get the fuck out of here!
Taliesin: If we can pull this off without burning anything important, then it doesn't matter.
Marisha: I want to go on record and say I think this is stupid. Okay, let's go.
Laura: That crystal looks really appetizing, and I want it.
Travis: How about we get ready to leave? I'll get on the carpet.
Laura: It looks really super magical.
Travis: Who's on the broom with Vex?
Laura: Me.
Travis: No, who is on the broom with you?
Taliesin: I'll be on the broom with her.
Travis: Do you want to get on the carpet with me?
Sam: Yeah, of course.
Marisha: I have to come with you because I have the Pass Without a Trace spell.
Taliesin: We all have to be together. We can't separate.
Travis: And he can fly.
Sam: No, he can't. He's done with his wings.
Liam: Yeah, that's right.
Sam: We have too many people for the carpet and the broom.
Liam: My wings are gone. There's no wings for Vecna unless we rest.
Travis: Well, kick Trinket out of the necklace, and I'll get in there.
Taliesin: I can also climb up the wall, if need be.
Sam: We can leave Trinket.
Liam: It's fine, I still have the boots. Just the wings. It was death or wings. I chose wings.
Travis: All right, so how do we fly? How do we do that?
Sam: I can burn a spell and be a giant eagle or something.
Taliesin: Just for shits and giggles, I'm going to take one last look around to see if there's any infrastructure for getting up. There must be infrastructure for getting up here. There wasn't layers of a city on top of each other.
Sam: We could just run.
Liam: But wait, where are we going though if we get this thing?
Sam: Up away.
Liam: We have no verification of an exit or a hole or anything!
Travis: Yeah, sometimes you just got to leap, okay?
Liam: That's my entire life, but this is the last moment.
Sam: Every organ in a body has an entrance and an exit, right? Wait, no, lungs don't; they just have the one.
Marisha: Wait up, we argued more this game more than anything else. Okay, we know we still have to fly upwards, including on flying up to the blue crystally thing right?
Laura: No, the blue crystal is right here.
Marisha: Well, then what the fuck?
Laura: I don't know!
Liam: We have a plan for getting the crystal, just not how to get the fuck out.
Marisha: We fucking fly!
Travis: Who burns a spell to become an animal?
Marisha: I can burn a spell.
Travis: You do that.
Marisha: We're probably going to take another short rest, right?
Travis: Probably.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: I can recall Simon 2. I can send him across the room, make a bunch of noise, draw a bunch of people over there. You run, grab the crystal, and then we hustle out of there.
Travis: What if only half the room leaves, though?
Laura: No, you go get Simon 2 to go get the crystal.
Sam: And there's going to be a floating crystal that marches across?
Travis: They don't give a shit. Do it. I'm on the carpet. We're ready to go.
Marisha: You're on me? And you're on carpet, and you're on broom?
Travis: Percy and Vex are on the broom.
Matt: Gnomes on the carpet with Grog. You and Percy on the broom. You're transforming into what creature?
Marisha: Giant eagle.
Matt: Giant eagle.
Marisha: Not yet, though.
Laura: And then we all, within 60 feet of each other, fly up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Okay, who's doing what?
Laura: Simon 2.
Sam: Simon 2 is going to go get the thing. Let's say they all start watching the thing come towards us. Grog, are you here? Are you with us?
Travis: Yeah, I have to be.
Sam: Can you throw something across the room to make a noise?
Travis: Yep. I can absolutely do that.
Laura: I'll prime an arrow.
Travis: I have a hooded lantern that has fuel in it. It will even burn when it lands. It's been sitting in there for four years.
Sam: This is a terrible plan.
Taliesin: This is why we hoarded it in the first place.
Sam: Guys, I'm just going to say this one more time before we do this: he's way faster than Simon 2. Simon 2 could create a distraction. He could (snatching noise).
Liam: Scanlan, only with the boots.
Travis: If they chase the jewel, fuck the jewel, and we'll leave.
Taliesin: If they chase the jewel, we can grab it and run, anyway.
Sam: All right, Simon 2. Come back with your bones!
Matt: The bones shift over towards you ever-so-slowly.
Liam: (singing) Don't worry, be happy now.
Sam: All right. Simon 2, go to the middle of the room. Throw the bones away, far, then grab the crystal. You don't have pockets. Run back to us! Away, yeah. Should he cover it with a blanket or something? Do you have a hood?
Matt: The bones begin to drift.
Taliesin: Okay, I'm not saying no.
Laura: A handkerchief to put over the light.
Sam: So it blocks the light? All right, so go put this handkerchief on the thing, pick it up, and bring it back to us. Go, Simon 2. You're our only hope.
Matt: Is Simon holding bones or a blanket?
Sam: He's holding a blanket.
Taliesin: He's holding a hanky.
Laura: He's holding a hanky.
Travis: Put the bones down gently.
Sam: Give me the bones. I put the bones down. Here's a handkerchief. You'll put it over the crystal, pick up the crystal, and bring it back to us.
Matt: Simon begins to slowly walk, the handkerchief floating by.
Taliesin: This is like those little handkerchief ghosts you would make in kindergarten.
Matt: As you glance inside and watch as it happens, you can see all the undead that are in there are standing, unmoving, swaying a little bit in place. Simon's about 30 feet out from them. About 20 feet out. They don't notice his presence. You notice that all the undead are facing the crystal, by the way.
Laura: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: Why didn't you tell us that before?
Marisha: (laughing) That's crucial information.
Sam: Right before he picks it up, hock a rock as far as you can.
Travis: Not the lantern?
Taliesin: Not the rock, the lantern. Light the lantern and throw it.
Marisha: By the way, they're all staring right at you. They're 100 percent aware of what's going on.
Matt: They're not staring at you. They're staring at the crystal.
Laura: They will be staring at us. What if we destroy the crystal? I wonder if all the undead would die. Let's keep going.
Matt: The handkerchief makes its way forward. Simon walks between the undead, and they don't even notice.
Sam: That's a good guy, that Simon 2.
Marisha: What happens?
Matt: The handkerchief moves over onto the crystal, and all the undead look over to the crystal, and the crystal lifts, and they all begin to (groans).
Travis: I take the hooded lantern and I (laughs) I throw the fucking piss out of it.
Matt: Make an attack roll. Roll and add your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, that's good! 19.
Matt: You're adding your strength modifier to that? Yeah. You're aiming at the opposite end?
Travis: If the entrance is here, I'm throwing it in the opposite direction of where we are.
Matt: With your strength? Easy enough. You lob it. It arcs over (flame noises) and explodes. The oil spreads across the ground. Flames ignite, and the bright light that emanates from it and the flames burst, and all the undead turn over (grunting) and begin to retract away. Two of them are following Simon. Only two of the undead are following Simon, currently. The others are distracted by the detonation of flame. They look confused.
Liam: How close are the pursuers?
Matt: They're making their way slowly. No, they're much faster than Simon.
Liam: I'm throwing.
Laura: I'm going to get down and shoot.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Just the ones following Simon!
Matt: Both of you guys roll an attack.
Travis: Are they far away from the other ones that aren't leaving yet?
Taliesin: It doesn't matter; they're not paying attention.
Laura: 25. No, 33.
Liam: 29.
Matt: Roll damage.
Taliesin: They drop out of nowhere. They faint. It's going to be good.
Marisha: So we hope.
Taliesin: I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Travis. Come on. Now is not the time to get squeamish.
Laura: 24.
Taliesin: We made a solemn oath.
Sam: They were innocent.
Taliesin: We agreed, weeks ago.
Liam: I rolled a 77 for mine.
Sam: 77?!
Matt: These two skeletons almost atomize. As they're walking, they're both gaining on Simon, and as they both start reaching towards where the dull bluish glow, mostly muted by the handkerchief, is floating in the air, they (growl) towards it. You watch as both their heads and torsos scatter across the ground, like a heavy wave of force blasted them across the stonework. The scraping sound hits as the detonation hits. The flames are dying down, and... no, no other undead see it. Slowly, the stone floats past, out of the doorway, and makes its way back to you.
Taliesin: Drop it in the Bag of Holding.
Matt: At this point, Simon's getting real close to the end of his hour-long casting time.
Sam: You've served us well.
Travis: Bag of Holding. It doesn't hurt my hand, or anything, does it?
Matt: No.
Travis: Cool! We've got that.
Matt: Whatever it is.
Laura: I guess we have it.
Marisha: Nothing happened to them when we put it in the Bag of Holding? They were like, (groaning) and kept going? All the undead?
Matt: All the undead inside that were distracted by the explosion of the lantern are riled up now, and they're starting to wander around, and some of them are starting to make their way towards the entrance to the temple. Some are making their way toward the staircase to head upward.
Marisha: Are we flying?
Travis: Yes, we fly up.
Matt: All right. You go into eagle form, grab Vax, and all of you guys make your way up into the cavern entrance.
Laura: Bubble. Tight bubble.
Matt: Currently, I believe the eagle form has darkvision. Right now, you have no light source.
Liam: I do. I can say things to her. I can see.
Matt: Right, so you guys are able to maneuver. So as you guys head up into the center part of the cavern, above the catwalks, you can see as you push through, about a third of them are still standing. A lot of them have collapsed in the center, and there's edges of bridges that come to a halt where they've collapsed and tumbled down into the cavern below. You can see straggling undead wandering the catwalks and these pathways along the edges of the cavern. As you pass forward through them-- I imagine you guys are cruising through as fast as you can?
Taliesin: Trying to avoid them.
Laura: We'll try to avoid the clusters.
Matt: A few of them seem to glance up and see you as you pass and reach, but they have nowhere to go. As you begin to cruise through the center of this cavern, following it to the opposite side, it widens further, and now as you look down, faintly, you can see bits of the orange bioluminescent fungus that are growing within this city below. You can see elements of these beautiful statues that are partially crumbled. You can see small homes that litter the center of this chamber. You can see some of the catwalks that meet in the center of this actually meet in a suspended platform that contains another dome-like structure that is partially caved in. With another shake and impact of the titan's footfall, you watch as one of its suspension pillars cracks, and the entire center finally gives way and falls and slams down, collapsing into the center of the chamber, it being there for the final moment of its tensile strength. As it slams down, you watch as it crushes about 40 or so various skeletons below, and from that blast, you can see something on the interior of it was apparently explosive or flammable, and it explodes, giving a brief flash of light into the center of this cavern. Where you had the brief outside of your visual range, you now look around and see the entirety of these dozens of catwalks and the city below you. Hundreds and hundreds of roving skeletons and mostly decomposed, mummified dwarven corpses that all glance towards this explosion. Some have been blasted away from it by the impact of the detonation. Others are making their way towards what the strange sound was, drawn towards it, but you're keeping this central safe space between, where none of them can grasp or assail you.
Laura: Were there other buildings like that, ready to fall from the ceiling?
Matt: Currently, what you see is just the one.
Liam: I'm looking for gaps or holes or anything in the ceiling of this cavern or anywhere to get out. MATT; You see entrances to homes that are built into the sides.
Sam: What about a tunnel or anything?
Matt: Make a perception check. Anyone who has darkvision can make a perception check.
Marisha: I have keen sight. Does that count?
Matt: You have advantage on your perception.
Marisha: Oh, shitty and shittier.
Liam: 27.
Travis: 18.
Laura: 18.
Sam: I didn't do one.
Marisha: 28.
Sam: I'm weeping over Simon 2.
Matt: Oh. Your keen eagle vision-- wait, you said you rolled shitty and shittier and still got 28?
Marisha: I have a plus 13, plus advantage.
Matt: Right. All right, cool. So glancing through your eagle vision, you can see the top of the chamber almost seems to come to a conical shape, and as you look up to the top of it, it emerges into a completely vertical chamber that rises up and out of the central opening of the city of Thomara.
Sam: Let's go.
Marisha: I take the lead, I guess. (caws)
Laura: (shushes) Caw quietly.
Liam: Vax is trying to appreciate his last ride.
Travis: Debbie Downer.
Liam: No way! I'm not going to stop. Fuck you all. Every game until the end, motherfuckers!
Matt: As the group of you make your way up into this vertical cavern, we're going to take a break. I need to take a break, myself.
Travis: Remember, we have the--
Travis: Sponsored announcement.
Matt: That's right. We have the Shadow of War video coming up at this break to give you a glance at this game coming up that we're all part of. If you haven't seen it, or if you have seen it, check it out, anyway. It's pretty awesome. Also, for this week's giveaway, Wyrmwood, we've got a little video for you here to show you what's up and what you can do and try to win it at the break, so pay attention, stick around, and we'll see you guys here in a few minutes.
Liam: This is what's up!
Travis: Yeah! [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. All right, so last we left off, you guys were all traveling upward through various means of flight, through a peak in the central cavern chamber in the center of Thomara, the long-dead dwarven city. As you begin to climb upward through this 15-foot-wide or so upward hallway, this cylindrical cavern, you continue upward for about 50 or so feet since passing through the ceiling of this chamber, and then it opens up into a domed room. Immediately, as you fly up, you see a ceiling come up, and you have to coast off to the side. You catch yourself, hovering there as the rest of you guys make your way in there. This domed, mushroom-shaped chamber with a very thin, circular floor around the outside with the hole that you entered at the bottom. Whoever would stand on the edge there would have the opportunity to either leap into or toss something down into this hole that would then drop them right into the center of the city.
Taliesin: Weird question  if I were holding the blue gem and had dropped it down this hole, what would be the likelihood it would have ended vaguely where it ended up?
Matt: Not at all. It was a ways off.
Taliesin: Just checking.
Laura: Are there any undead around us right now?
Matt: Currently? Glancing around, you do not see any undead.
Marisha: You said things or people? Is this a body-sized hole?
Matt: No, it's about 15 feet wide. The full chamber is maybe 50 or so feet across. About a 20-foot walkway, circular, before the hole in the center.
Liam: Did you say the hole is a natural gap in the cave, or does it look made?
Matt: If you glance down and look about the interior of this chamber, it is not natural. It is all carved.
Laura: Can we look at the gem for a second, since there's no undead around?
Matt: If you want to. Grog has it.
Travis: Do you want me to pull it out?
Laura: Yeah. Can you do an arcana check on it?
Sam: Sure. I can look at it.
Laura: How big is it? Is it baseball-sized?
Matt: It's about that big.
Travis: No undead, right? No creatures, nobody that's going to (whoop) to the shiny blue light?
Laura: We can't see anything around us?
Matt: Not at the moment, no.
Sam: I remove the handkerchief. I look at it. I inspect it like a jeweler inspecting a jewel. 18 arcana check.
Matt: Okay. It's definitely magical. The blue light from it grows stronger, then weaker. Stronger, then weaker. It has this rhythmic flash to it, like a heart or something that has a pulse to it.
Marisha: How is it lining up towards the steps of the giant?
Matt: Not at all. It's much quicker.
Marisha: Much quicker.
Matt: It's cold to the touch.
Taliesin: Does it do anything to the Titanstone Knuckles?
Liam: Is it faster than my heartbeat?
Matt: It's slower.
Liam: Slower.
Travis: That's slow.
Marisha: So it's very slow, but not as slow as the rate he's walking.
Travis: Is it a cut jewel, or is it rough?
Matt: It's rough. No jeweler's hand has touched it. There are some edges that have flat surfaces; it looks like there have been things that have chipped off the stone.
Taliesin: Does it have the vibe of something petrified?
Matt: No, it has almost a quartz-like look to it. Elements of it appear to be cloudier or imperfect, and some areas appear to be clearer, and light shines through a little brighter.
Liam: It's like a hunk at the natural history museum of minerals.
Matt: Yeah, but there is an enchantment.
Sam: What about Pikey-pants? Can she detect if it's evil or good or something? Does she do that?
Laura: You should do that.
Liam: I'm going to do that.
Matt: Okay. You don't get a sense of any evil from the stone.
Sam: You said no sense of evil?
Matt: No evil coming from the stone.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to gaze into it super hard.
Matt: You look really hard into the stone as you hold it to your face, and your eyes almost cross as you glance into the very core source of this pulsating arcane energy. It's bright.
Laura: So bright, y'all.
Matt: It hurts a little bit, and you wince after a while.
Laura: I saw so many things.
Liam: She looked at the eclipse, too.
Travis: We don't have Identify or anything like that, do we?
Marisha: No.
Sam: No.
Laura: You know who had that?
Sam: No, who?
Laura: Our good friend, Tary. He was wonderful.
Sam: Who is it? Oh, the fancy fellow? He's probably dead somewhere.
Travis: I think we should try and smash it.
Sam: Don't you think that about everyone and everything?
Marisha: I'm not against this idea.
Travis: What else are we going to do to it before we face El Vecna?
Taliesin: My only other thought of how it could be useful, at this point, with what we know about it--
Sam: Is "El Vecna" Spanish for Vecna?
Travis: Sí.
Taliesin: It seemed like the undead were crowding towards it, which means that if we do get attacked by a group of undead, we might be able to shiny-object them, unless, of course, it's dangerous in their hands.
Travis: Or we spike it down the hole, and it causes a hydrogen bomb, and we shatter this titan in half.
Taliesin: That literally made the dungeon master laugh, so I don't know if that's necessarily--
Travis: It's blue, right? That is the color of hydrogen.
Taliesin: That's the color of Dr. Manhattan. I don't necessarily know if it's the same thing.
Travis: It is known.
Sam: Why don't we hang onto it for now? In a moment of peril, we can throw it or smash it.
Taliesin: Not crazy, trying to crack it.
Liam: What if it stops this thing where it stands? We're all thinking that this thing could be its heart.
Sam: Its heart?
Travis: It's palm-sized, right?
Taliesin: It could be a chunk of heart.
Laura: Is it the same color as his Knuckles?
Travis: No, these are stone-gray. This is blue crystal.
Matt: There's nothing about it that gives you the sense, based on what you've seen both outside and within the titan, that it is of similar essence to the titan, from what you understand.
Travis: It could be a soul or something.
Sam: Soul glow?
Travis: Does Pike have anything that detects a soul?
Liam: It's not evil. It's not good. It could be the thing that's keeping these undead moving.
Travis: Well, then I don't know what else to do. I think we keep moving.
Liam: I like the spiking idea.
Laura: I'm okay squishing it with the hammer.
Liam: I think that you should let me squish it, because if that blows up--
Laura: I think it's funny that we spent so much time getting it, and then we're going to destroy it.
Liam: We spent ten minutes getting this thing.
Travis: We'll think about smashing it when we take our rest. Maybe a cause will reveal itself.
Taliesin: Hold onto it for now. It could come in handy.
Marisha: It's like that dress you bought four years ago you still haven't worn. It might find a purpose.
Sam: All right, focus!
Laura: Let's get out of this dome.
Travis: Is there any writing or engraving or runes on the edge of the circle that's been engineered?
Matt: On the edge of the circle? No. It's smooth stone, intently designed to be a drop or opening of some kind.
Taliesin: Are there exits?
Matt: Make an investigation check. You don't see any doorways or passageways.
Marisha: Wait, there's not a hole that we can go up?
Matt: There's a hole that you came through to come into this chamber. Imagine a dome. You're in the chamber.
Taliesin: I literally rolled a one. I'm aware that there's a hole.
Matt: You get vertigo as you stand in the chamber.
Laura: Is this investigation or perception?
Matt: You look about, and you don't see any exit. Investigation to see if there's any hidden or not-immediately-noticeable exits or entryways.
Laura: 23.
Matt: 23. As you do a pass around, looking closely along the wall, you see two small domed doors that have metal rods jammed through, almost like a small barricade that's been placed down on one side of a doorway. However, they are closed from this side.
Laura: So you could open them up?
Matt: You could.
Laura: Are they trapped? I'll look to see if they're trapped.
Liam: On it.
Travis: Also fair to assume that whatever's on the other side of that door--
Liam: 27.
Matt: 27?
Laura: I rolled an 18.
Matt: You're both looking at the same one?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Neither of you notice any traps.
Laura: All right, then I'm going to try to jimmy open that lock.
Travis: Whoa.
Laura: I already said it.
Matt: Make a strength check.
Liam: Not locked.
Laura: Two! Wait. Yeah, that's straight-up strength, not a saving throw? Two!
Sam: Two?
Laura: I'm really fucking weak. You'd think I'd be stronger pulling the bowstring, but no.
Travis: Use your legs. Really, use your legs.
Laura: Okay. I put my legs up on the wall and (grunts).
Matt: It is not budging.
Liam: Can I use my finger skills to see if it's locked? Just my finger skills. I made a perception check to see if it's trapped. Wouldn't I know if it's locked?
Matt: The lock is the barricading mechanism on it. There is no handle.
Liam: I'm going to try to sidestep this lock with my lock-picking skills.
Travis: It's a barricade.
Marisha: It's a barricade.
Liam: There's nothing to do?
Marisha: It's like steel rebar in front of the door.
Travis: Is there any decorating or writing or scratching around the door frame or wall around the door? Anything other than a portal to go through?
Matt: Not from what you can see, no. The room's pretty simple. The construction of it may be older than most of the things that you've seen in the city below and previous chambers. It seems to be built almost for function rather than ceremony.
Laura: It's a trash chute.
Marisha: That's what I was going to say. Is it a water chute? Drainage? Is this a drain pipe?
Laura: We could fill the city with water. Drown all the zombies.
Matt: One thing you do notice, which is interesting as you're glancing around at the side, looking at the ground at the bottom of it, there's a very faint groove in the ground that leads toward the central hole at the base of each of these doorways.
Marisha: Does there appear to be any other type of chutes coming into this room?
Matt: No, just the two doors on the opposite sides.
Travis: How far apart are the doors?
Matt: Opposite sides of the chamber, yeah.
Taliesin: So there's a bar. The door is barred, then?
Matt: Correct.
Taliesin: So break it. Let's get out of the way and pop the bar. See if we can pop the bar right off the door.
Travis: Do we want to have Keyleth there in case 900 undead zombies start pouring through, and she can Wall of Stone the door?
Marisha: I'll be with you. Yeah. I'm right behind you, man.
Travis: I will try and remove one of the doors. I don't know how to delineate between them.
Taliesin: The left one.
Travis: Sure. Yeah. It's a circle. That one. 25.
Matt: 25. It immediately comes off to the side, and when you lift it, you realize that it's bolted to the wall to the side, and it curves upward and holds it in place. This is meant to stay in place.
Laura: Wow. Really? It was meant to move? I think I loosened it for you, Grog.
Travis: I didn't get that sense at all.
Matt: As you lift it up, the door is now unbarred.
Travis: Shall I?
Laura: Yeah, open the door!
Travis: Are the hinges on this side so it looks like it opens towards me?
Matt: It looks like it opens towards you, yes.
Travis: I'll pull open the door.
Marisha: I'm at the ready for whatever.
Matt: Okay. We'll say as you entered and landed, the door on the left. Okay, so as you pull that one open, immediately preparing yourself, a couple of rocks tumble out, and it reveals a packed-tight mass of earth and stone.
Laura: Shit! Let's try the other one.
Travis: Should I punch the rubble?
Laura: No, let's try the other door first.
Travis: I make my way around.
Taliesin: We set ourselves up.
Travis: 20 on the dot.
Matt: 20. (metal creaking) It lifts over without an issue. Pull the door open. You lift it open, and a few rocks tumble past, but a slick rockslide incline continues upward, dry, no water. Nothing.
Travis: A rockslide continues onward. Slick, dry.
Laura: How big is the tunnel?
Matt: It's about four feet wide or so.
Laura: So we can fit in?
Matt: Yeah, you can fit in.
Taliesin: We have some Immovable Rods.
Matt: When I say slide, I mean smooth stone, like an actual slide. You get the sense that there was some sort of aqueduct-type scenario.
Laura: We brace ourselves on the wall to make sure we don't slide down.
Taliesin: Whoever's in the back should have the Immovable Rods, so if there's a sudden rush of water, we can create a grate for ourselves.
Matt: You envision that at one point, long ago, this would have been a beautiful waterfall in the center of Thomara's chamber that has now dried.
Travis: Dope. That's awesome. I'm getting creepy as fuck now. I've got the Immovable Rod; I'll be the caboose.
Marisha: I've got the other one, so I'll be second.
Matt: So Grog is the caboose.
Marisha: Keyleth in front of Grog.
Matt: Keyleth in front of Grog? All right. Who's in front of them?
Sam: Me.
Matt: Scanlan.
Laura: Pike.
Matt: Then Pike. All righty.
Taliesin: Myself and the twins, I suppose.
Laura: Yeah. I want to be in the front.
Travis: I'll go ahead and take the Immovable Rod out and have it in my hand.
Marisha: Samesies.
Matt: So you've got both of those. Oh, I totally forgot there was a winner for this. I'm sorry. I should do that, huh? RyanBoo, you're the winner. Danoba will contact you and get you your cherry deck box soon. Now that's taken care of. You make your way up the slide, and it's relatively gradual; it's not too heavy of a scenario. You make your way upward, upward, and about 30 or so feet up, the walls of it separate out and appear to break into two smaller chambers, like this was a breaking point where a person could enter from either side to check on the flow or do maintenance on whatever the ducting was. The slide continues upward. Vax and Vex, you get to that portion and lift yourselves up, looking right to left. It ends on one side, and it looks like there's some dry-rotted wooden crates, and to the left, a staircase.
Marisha: So it looks like a landing?
Matt: It's a brief landing for somebody who needed to come in and do repairs, maintenance, or checking on the flow of water.
Laura: Keep going up the slide or take the stairs?
Liam: Quick glance in the crates?
Marisha: No, if you're going to take a quick glance, then we have to bust them open like a proper RPG.
Travis: They're dry-rotted. They'll break easy.
Matt: They will. What do you do?
Liam: Check them out. I eat some edamame.
Matt: So you lift the crates. There are only two of them, and they're relatively small: two feet by two feet. The first one, you open up and look inside, and there are rusted tools. Long iron bars; some appear wrench-like. It looks like whatever mechanism was used as the early aqueduct system for this, this box contained materials, though you're uncertain as to what their application was into this system.
Taliesin: I'll take a glance at these things to memorize their general shape.
Travis: After you're done with them, I'll actually take them.
Matt: You go and grab a few. There's five rods of varying widths. Some appear to be ratchet elements, where they fit around different metal caps. There's one that looks like a wide crowbar that's used to hold or wedge elements separately. Very basic; nothing too intricate.
Taliesin: This is some basic shit that you're picking up right now.
Liam: That was the first crate. What's the next crate? Is it whoopee cushions?
Matt: No, the next crate you open up and it looks mostly empty, but it looks like there are a couple of rows of small glass vials, half of which appear to be broken or shattered, but there are three remaining, with a faint bluish liquid on the inside.
Laura: Does that sound familiar to us at all?
Liam: Healing potions are blue.
Matt: These don't resemble healing potions, actually.
Taliesin: Do these resemble underwater breathing?
Matt: They do. You've seen these before.
Liam: For toilet diving.
Taliesin: Emergency, yeah. Let's take those.
Travis: Okay. I got them.
Liam: I give one of them to Percy for being so sharp. I give one to my sister. You don't need it. I keep one. No, I don't. I'm barely alive. I give one to Scanlan.
Sam: I give it to Grog.
Travis: I've got one. I've got two, actually.
Sam: All right, then I'll keep one.
Taliesin: Just in case.
Travis: I've got two vials of underwater breathing.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Why is there no water running?
Travis: Any other boxes to smash?
Matt: No.
Marisha: I'd imagine because he's vertical now instead of horizontal.
Travis: And undead.
Sam: Let's keep going up the stairs.
Matt: All right. Heading up the stairs in the same order?
Liam: 30 to 40 feet in advance.
Matt: All righty. 30 to 40 feet in advance? Okay. You make your way up the staircase. Roll stealth.
Travis: Immovable Rod's out.
Liam: 28 for stealth.
Matt: Okay. Are you stealthing, as well? Are you going along with him, or are you letting him go ahead?
Liam: She's coming.
Laura: Natural 20.
Matt: All right, so the two of you very quietly make your way ahead, the rest of you keeping within, I assume, the range of the ring. The staircase doesn't go too far; it goes maybe 30 or so feet, and then it opens into a hallway. You're stepping up through the floor, and there's about ten feet behind and to the sides of you. There's a slight element of a cave-in to the left of you, where part of the stone seems to have collapsed, and a bit of the earth has filtered in. It's a smooth stone floor that's tiled in places. The walls continue on, a somewhat trapezoid-like angle. There are other portions of the wall that have caved in on certain elements, and there are two large pillars that mark the center of this hallway, either used as support beams or decorative, but they go from ceiling to floor. You glance over the side, and you see a distant staircase on the far end of this hallway, maybe 80 to 90 feet from where you are, if not further, with larger stairs. You've seen some of the dwarven-based ones. These seem to be a little more grandiose as they lift up higher and higher. Part of that hallway is completely collapsed; it's a wall of fallen earth. But there's a hole carved out of it. There's a tunnel that has been pushed through. You hear this very faint buzzing sound. Very faint. This (low humming). A very faint vibration. You also see a figure stepping from a side wall crevasse, an opening of a similar shape to the circular opening in the wall.
Liam: I hide.
Laura: We were stealthed.
Matt: You guys were stealthed. You re-hide, while stealthed.
Liam: That's what I do.
Matt: You hear some muttering across the way in the shadow. There's a faint source of light that looks like a glowing orb that's floating in the air above and giving this faint greenish-white light; a bauble that's giving a light source to whatever this cloaked figure is. You hear the muttering, and two more walk down the staircase to join them. You recognize, from the faint bit of light, a glimmer of metal around the neck of one of them that is the symbol, the hole with the metallic fork. You see Remnants of Vecna.
Sam: Remnants?
Matt: You don't see any faces. You see a glimmer or shine on the metal from the light cast from the bauble.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: What?
Taliesin: This can't be happening right now.
Liam: We don't recognize faces? We don't see faces?
Matt: You see hooded figures that are walking in. There are three of them.
Marisha: Oh, so they're cultists.
Matt: Okay. So which ones are you aiming at? There's three of them.
Laura: I'm aiming at the first one I saw.
Matt: Okay, the first one you saw just stepped out of the center of the hall there, and then the two others walked down the hallway. You're aiming at the one that came out of the side of the wall?
Laura: Has he seen the two coming down the stairway yet?
Matt: There's been discussion over the shoulder. They seem to be aware of each other's presence, but they haven't come together to engage as three in the same area yet.
Liam: I will follow my sister's lead. If she attacks one, I send one to another one and two to the third.
Laura: I'll attack the first so he can take the second.
Liam: One. Two, three.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Laura: These are auto-crits, though, because we are surprising them.
Matt: This is true.
Laura: Can I Hunter's Mark him?
Matt: Yes, you can Hunter's Mark him.
Laura: Oh, so we don't have to roll for attack? It's an auto-crit.
Matt: Well, no, you still have to roll to see if you aim. You have advantage on the attack.
Laura: 27.
Liam: 27 on my first.
Matt: Okay, both hit.
Laura: Second attack. Oh my god, 20. 20 on the second attack.
Matt: Okay, that hits.
Laura: I got a one on both. Thank god they were both at advantage.
Liam: 27. 19, 25.
Matt: Okay, all three hit.
Laura: And they're all critical?
Matt: No, the first one crits.
Liam: Oh, really? Okay. The first is sneak attack.
Matt: They're not all crit. Once you hit the person they are no longer surprised.
Laura: Okay, so the first one is a crit. Solid! That's okay.
Marisha: Yeah, I feel so bad for you.
Liam: You are the most powerful person at this table.
Laura: 14, plus six lightning damage. Oh wait, you know what? Should I single out the lightning damage or say what all the damage is?
Matt: Well, it's an auto-crit, so lightning damage is doubled, as well.
Laura: So it's 12 lightning damage.
Matt: Right, plus whatever your sneak attack damage is.
Laura: Okay.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's happening.
Travis: You already did 40 point of damage without doubling.
Laura: Don't do that.
Sam: Travis, shut up! These two and their gigantic damage rolls.
Taliesin: Huge, mammoth.
Sam: Huge, bulbous.
Taliesin: Turgid.
Laura: I had already rolled that, but it was a six again, so 40, plus 12 lightning damage. On the first.
Matt: 52 points of damage.
Liam: I got 48 on my first, but that's it. 48, done.
Laura: I didn't do Hunter's Mark damage on that first guy.
Matt: This is on the other guy; the second guy.
Laura: Add ten because of Hunter's Mark on the first one.
Marisha: Little bit of that reach around.
Sam: The dice smell a little bit.
Liam: 48. 20, ten.
Matt: So 48 on your critical.
Liam: That's the critical. That's the dice damage. I rolled really low.
Matt: 20, ten. Okay, then. All righty. Are you shooting the same guy, Laura?
Laura: Yes, I was all on one, unless he went down. Would I notice?
Matt: No, he did not go down.
Laura: Okay, then the second one. 21 on the second one.
Matt: That does it.
Travis: How much damage? Total.
Matt: Total on that round from you would have been 110 with the first hit between the two of you on the first guy and the second hit. So the one that was off to the side, who is leaning forward, hunched over, and looking over his shoulder. The first arrow goes into the throat and he reaches for it, and as he does, the dagger (impact) into the face, into the socket where there is no eye, which then looks up with a groan. Finger goes out as soon as the second arrow takes the other eye out, and then falls back down to the ground, dead. Pointing your direction like (gasping). As soon as the two other daggers go into the other two, they both see the one crumple to the ground, the two left there, the guy who is standing at the stairs--
Liam: May I also dump some poison?
Matt: Sure, into which one?
Liam: Into the first one. I did one into my first target and two into the second; the poison would have gone into the second person. It's a DC of 15.
Matt: All righty. DC of 15? Yeah, that succeeds. 16.
Liam: So nothing, right?
Matt: Nothing, yeah.
Liam: Balls!
Matt: As soon as the one crumples to the ground and the two other daggers into the other two that are there, they (grunt). They see the one fall. The one in the center of the chamber glances over his shoulder and says, "It seems I'm the lucky one. Odell, run back and tell that Viskorad found sneaky prey." The one immediately to the left begins to run up the stairs.
Laura: Can I shoot him again before he runs away?
Matt: Nope because you took your turn. This is their reaction.
Sam: Oh shit. You need help, Matt?
Liam: Initiative!
Matt: We're about to roll initiative, motherfuckers.
Laura: Sorry, guys. We did it.
Marisha: Viskon? We've heard the name Viskon before.
Sam: We've also heard the name Odell.
Liam: Yeah, Odell.
Marisha: Odell comma tell Viskon we have visitors. Wait, when did we hear Odell before?
Liam: I just know we've heard it.
Sam: There's been three Jamieson's in our campaign, too. Matt isn't an infinite fount of names.
Matt: Everyone else is still down the stairs right there.
Laura: I wonder if we should have let them talk for a second. Oh, well.
Liam: That's not our way.
Matt: Apparently not, as recent events have shown. So now, I need everyone to roll initiative.
Travis: Don't fuck me, Gil.
Laura: No, it's okay. I've got advantage.
Marisha: Don't let them leave. I agree with that.
Taliesin: Leave one of them alive, but don't let them leave.
Liam: Not good for Pike.
Marisha: Did everyone roll shittily?
Travis: No.
Matt: 25 to 20?
Laura: 23.
Travis: 21.
Liam: Get that long range. Get that runner.
Matt: 20 to 15?
Sam: 18.
Marisha: 15.
Matt: All righty.
Marisha: What's up, bro?
Liam: I'm not fast.
Taliesin: 13.
Liam: 13.
Travis: That's weird for you.
Taliesin: It's almost as low as I can go.
Matt: 13 for Pike? No, that's Vax. What's Pike?
Liam: Pike clocked in at four.
Matt: Pike is clocking in as Pike.
Liam: Yeah. Where's the remix of this song?
Taliesin: I know. (beatboxes)
Matt: All righty, so beginning of the round. Vex, you're up first.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to cast Grasping Vine around here, so he can lash up and try to catch that wizard, the cloaked guy that's running away.
Matt: What's he have to roll for that?
Laura: He has to roll a dexterity save above 15.
Marisha: Get it! Get it, son!
Matt: That's an eight. He is running up the stairs.
Laura: So it snatches his ankle.
Matt: And then drags him.
Laura: Backwards. Then I'm going to shoot him twice.
Matt: All right. Go for it.
Taliesin: Not that one. That one looks like he knows too much.
Laura: What is that? 32.
Matt: 32, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Laura: 14, plus four lightning damage. I don't get sneak attack on this guy, though?
Matt: No.
Laura: Okay. 14, plus four lightning damage, and then I'm going to hit him again. That is also a 32. No, that's-- well, it's very high. 27? 28
Matt: 28. All right, that hits. Roll damage. Grog, you're up next. You're in the back of the marching order.
Travis: We're not up at the top, are we?
Matt: No. So you've got at least 25, 30 feet before you can get to the top there.
Laura: 12, plus six lightning damage.
Matt: Nice. All right, 36 points of damage in one round. The arrows (impact) as he is pulled through the rock and rubble by the Grasping Vine that is currently wrapped around him.
Laura: I am going to use my movement to stand behind this little pillar right here.
Matt: Okay, go for it. Grog, you're up.
Travis: As I hear the sweet melodical Miami Vice tunes of warfare being played, can I double dash up past my mates and into the fray?
Matt: Sure, so at 30 feet, it'll get you right at the edge of the stairs. Still have 20 more feet you can go.
Travis: Yeah, straight towards them.
Matt: All right, so that's there.
Travis: Then can I use dash to go the rest of the way?
Matt: To close the gap there? Sure.
Travis: Now, I only have my bonus action left, so can I go into a rage?
Matt: You may, yeah. All righty, so at that point you go into a rage.
Travis: That's my turn.
Matt: All righty, so now it is his turn.
Marisha: You have that guy? But this guy was the runner, I thought.
Taliesin: Yeah, but he's vined.
Marisha: Okay. He's currently grasped.
Matt: Okay, as soon as you rush up into his face, you hear the individual, the hood pulled back at this point. You see shaved entirely bald, older, late fifties to early sixties, missing one eye, but in that socket you can see a faint spark of arcane energy. Shouting out amongst the space, "Glory and reward is mine! Wraiths, go forth and devour, while I bring oblivion to them." As you rush up, is going to cast Wall of Force right in the space between there.
Marisha: Between him and Grog?
Laura: (singing) The space between.
Sam: (singing) Your wicked lies.
Matt: It pushes you back five feet, and now there is a Wall of Force that is blocking that side of the hallway from where he is.
Marisha: Him and the other guy? Or just between him? How big is it?
Matt: Sorry, the entirety of this chamber is the Wall of Force.
Marisha: Fucking fuckface.
Travis: What does Wall of Force do? Can I walk through that shit?
Marisha: Yeah, it just might hurt.
Travis: Will it?
Matt: As soon as the wall appears there, you see a slight short barrier that forces you back about five feet. You catch your back foot, and now as the barrier finishes shimmering, it's invisible. Looks like there's nothing there. He's grinning from there. He glances over to the right into the hole in the wall where his friend was earlier.
Travis: Which was that way, right?
Matt: As he glances over, he goes, "Odell, bring me the sphere." You hear the humming noise, the faint humming vibrational noise, now louder. That ends his turn. Actually, he is going to take a step back up onto the stairs there. Scanlan, you're up.
Sam: I'm up? What can I do?
Matt: You're 20 feet down from the staircase.
Sam: My speed is 25.
Matt: That'll get you right up to about there, with five-foot steps.
Marisha: Don't let them leave!
Sam: Oh god, this looks like a crazy thing.
Travis: (counting) 60 is how far away he is.
Sam: Wow. There's a Wall of Force. Do I see a Wall of Force?
Matt: You don't. You actually rush up, and it looks like it's an open hallway right now.
Sam: Okay. I see Grog in attack mode, right? I see these two bad guys. I will send a Lightning Bolt at somebody.
Matt: Which one?
Sam: Looks like I can't see this guy because there is a pillar in between, so the other guy.
Matt: That's true, so it'll be that guy. All right. You'll have to move off to the side, or else you're going to hit Grog with the Lightning Bolt. It's going to be hard. He's up a few steps, though. You could probably aim it above and hit him without Grog. I'll let you do that. As you get to the top, you release your bolt of lightning. (crackling noise) It arcs forward, and as it gets right above Grog, it hits something solid and splinters. No effect.
Liam: So this Wall of Force visually is floor to ceiling?
Matt: You don't know; you don't see it. He saw a faint shimmer because something pushed him out of this space, but right now you have no visual perspective. That's going to end Scanlan's turn, I believe. All right. The other guy, who is currently held by the vine that falls limp off of his body--
Laura: It falls limp off of his body?
Matt: Well, it doesn't wrap around or keep him held. Every turn, it can pull something towards it. He's going to glance over towards the side, listening to what the other, Viskorad, said. Okay. At which point, that humming gets louder and louder.
Taliesin: He had the map. If he built the map, there's a way out.
Matt: You watch as a two-foot-wide black sphere of void-like nothingness comes carving through the stone wall immediately to the left of you, Grog, leaving a completely disintegrated form roughly the shape of its sphere. It's coasting in towards and into your space.
Travis: It's a Sphere of Annihilation.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Taliesin: Oh shit, son!
Laura: Oh god!
Sam: Is someone controlling it?
Matt: So Grog, I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Laura: Oh my god, roll so well! Do you get advantage?
Travis: I do. I have Danger Sense. It fucks you up. Yeah, it hurts real bad.
Sam: I see this happening, right?
Travis: 16.
Matt: 16, okay. You manage to duck out of the way as it enters the space, and you can feel this weird energy. Your beard is almost being pulled toward it, and the loud vibrating (vibration) hum before you. It's like staring into an absolute nothingness.
Travis: Take my life, but not my beard.
Marisha: Who looks like he's controlling it? Odell?
Matt: The guy who is being pulled by her is concentrating and moving it over, at that point.
Laura: Oh, the guy in red? The guy in red is controlling it!
Matt: All right. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: (yells)
Matt: I've got to rest for a second. Controlling enemies hurt. It's okay.
Sam: We can get dudes behind you to hold you up.
Matt: We'll see how I can do it. Keyleth, your turn.
Marisha: Oh my god. So much has changed from what I thought I was going to do.
Matt: You're about 25 feet down the staircase.
Marisha: Yeah. So I come up from the staircase.
Matt: Okay. That gets you up to the edge there, where the staircase stops.
Travis: Does the Sphere of Annihilation get an attack of opportunity if I run away?
Taliesin: Probably not.
Sam: Is it a thing? Is it a weapon?
Matt: It's a black sphere of void. One of the guys is looking focused, concentrating on it, and it moved under his willpower in the direction of Grog.
Travis: It's real bad.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to come up. I'm trying to think of what I have in range, and I'm terrified. And I'm going to stick with my original instinct and do Wall of Stone and try and wall these guys in so they can't run. I think they can still carve through it with their big black death orb now.
Travis: They can, but at least they'll be here.
Taliesin: They'll have to move the orb to do that.
Marisha: Okay. I can do ten ten-foot by ten-foot panels, so I want to be a semicircle block off, bring up a whole wall of stone behind them.
Matt: Okay. Hold on a second.
Travis: Who can get to the other side? You have Dimension Door. But that's it, right? That's the only person that has that kind of a thing.
Matt: As you attempt to concentrate and create a Wall of Stone, you are unable to pick a point or an area beyond the barrier.
Travis: The Wall of Force? No!
Laura: Say it again?
Travis: And you need to focus, or is it a random?
Matt: It doesn't fizzle the spell. You have no area to release it on. The barrier, while invisible, is preventing targeting a specific area to create.
Taliesin: We need to dispel this shit.
Marisha: I do have Dispel Magic.
Matt: You've used your action to attempt it. You didn't lose the spell slot, but you spent your action attempting it.
Travis: Hey, man. That was a nice try.
Marisha: Can't cast through it.
Laura: Good to know. But the orb went through it?
Matt: No, the orb is on the other side.
Marisha: Even though it's a nature thing, going up underneath there, I can't get around it? No?
Matt: You're targeting on the other side of the wall. It has to be in visual range for you to create it to happen.
Marisha: (singing) I'll see you on the other side of the wall. (laughter)
Matt: All right. That's Keyleth's turn. No, sorry. At the end of Keyleth's turn, you hear this (breathy noise) sound as these two shadowy figures emerge from the nearby walls.
Liam: Ghosts! Shadows!
Travis: No. What? Ghosts or wraiths?
Marisha: Wraiths.
Liam: There's ten different kinds of things like that.
Marisha: Hey, was wraiths what fucked me and you up when we were evil Vax and Keyleth?
Taliesin: Oh shit, and look what they're doing!
Matt: This one hovers over and lands behind Keyleth. And it's going to attempt, as it seems to shift through the pillar--
Marisha: I look over my shoulder and go  Oh no!
Matt: This one here stays within the pillar, and it reaches out, as it's incorporeal, and strikes at you. That is 24 against you, Vex.
Laura: That hits.
Matt: All right. You suffer 21 points of necrotic damage, and I need you to succeed on a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Fuck! Come on.
Travis: My fucking god!
Sam: It's a 20? (screaming)
Matt: All right. Well, you suffer the 21 points of necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by 21.
Laura: Forever?
Matt: Until you finish a long rest. The other one's striking at you, Keyleth. That is a 16.
Marisha: Misses!
Matt: That's right, because your AC is 17 with the ring.
Marisha: That's right! I leveled up, motherfuckers!
Matt: All right. Cool. Technically, leveling up didn't affect your AC; however, calculating the magic item did.
Marisha: But I feated, so I'm good!
Matt: I know. So as it swings toward you, its claw streaks out and has no effect. And then they both vanish. You want to take an attack of opportunity? You can if you'd like to.
Marisha: War Caster?
Matt: War Caster. You can attempt to cast a spell on it as a reaction, if you'd like. This one's going to back away into the wall, as well. Vex, you also get an attack of opportunity if you'd like, with a melee weapon.
Marisha: Does it have to be a bonus action?
Matt: No, it can be an action. That's part of the War Caster feat.
Laura: I have a dagger, but I don't even have it drawn.
Matt: Then yeah, you're fine.
Liam: They're both out of visual range, right?
Matt: They both are now backing up.
Liam: One's in a pillar, and one went through a wall. Are they moaning and shit, in the wall?
Matt: You can't hear them.
Liam: I can't hear them. Can't see them, can't hear them. All right. Thanks.
Matt: No worries.
Laura: I have resistance to necrotic damage, by the way.
Matt: You do! Then you take ten points of necrotic damage, and your hit points are only reduced by ten.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Sorry, I'm trying to figure out what would be a good idea right now.
Taliesin: I have no ideas for anything.
Marisha: I have never done this before, but I have it learned. I will Ice Knife it in its face. Ice Knife! Level one, you create a shard of ice, fling it at-- oh, it's a flingy-thingy. But it's 1d10 piercing damage, and then it explodes?
Matt: Okay. It's right next to you. She has the feat where she can cast the spell as a reaction when something comes at her. Just know that whatever you're hitting is right next to you. So if it explodes, does any radial damage, it might come back and hit you.
Marisha: No, hit or miss, the shard then explodes, the target and each creature within five feet of the point where the ice explodes. Oh. I'm fine. I'm doing it anyway.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll to hit.
Travis: And Scanlan's in five feet of her?
Laura: No, he's behind her.
Taliesin: Oh, for fuck sake.
Marisha: What's wrong with us?
Laura: Wasted all of our 20s on goods.
Matt: Tonight is ridiculous.
Marisha: One.
Matt: All right, so as you release the Ice Knife, it slams into the wall. No effect. However, it does still explode, right?
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: So it does what damage?
Marisha: 2d6.
Matt: 2d6 damage. So go ahead and roll 2d6. To both you and the creature?
Taliesin: Yeah, all creatures within range.
Marisha: Technically, reroll ones. Three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, each creature. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes.
Matt: All right, so you take seven points of ice damage, and it hits the wraith. However, the cold damage doesn't seem to have as much of an effect as you would expect.
Laura: It's a fucking wraith!
Matt: That ends their turn. Percival, you're up.
Taliesin: I hear a whole bunch of commotion, so I'm going to pop my head up out of the hole and see what the fuck is going on.
Matt: All right. You glance up and get just beyond where Keyleth is, pushing past. You have five more feet you can move if you want.
Taliesin: Well, I'm coming up the hole. I take a look. Oh, sweet god. I'm going to take a shot at the guy I see up on the table there.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: That's better.
Matt: Which guy?
Taliesin: Yeah, the gray. And that's 28?
Matt: Okay. (gunshot) You fire a shot and watch as it detonates against some sort of invisible wall that you didn't see was there before, scattering helplessly against the space in the air.
Marisha: I hate this force field shit.
Travis: It explodes near my head, and I'm like Stop shooting into this thing!
Taliesin: I'm going to drop back down the hall.
Matt: All right, you get right back down to right there. That ends your turn, Percy? Vax, you're up.
Liam: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dance through to here, where I can see Grog and these guys, and I can see all my friends here, and I'm going to hold my action to attack anyone who comes right up to one of my friends within striking range.
Matt: Okay, good to know. Perfect. Ending Vax's turn, Pike's up.
Laura: Pike comes running up the steps.
Matt: She can get right up to here, and that's as much as she can move. She can still cast a spell if she wants to. She's going to cast Beacon of Hope for all of the allies within range, which is 30 feet.
Matt: All right, so that is everybody but Grog.
Laura: Sorry, Grog.
Travis: That's my fault.
Laura: That gives everybody advantage on wisdom saving throws and death saving throws, and any time you're healed, you regain the maximum number of hit points.
Sam: Even if we move out of the radius?
Matt: It affects everybody at that moment, and then you carry it with you.
Laura: Wisdom and death saving throws.
Liam: You got glitter-bombed with holy goodness.
Marisha: Wisdom and death plus what?
Laura: And full hit points when you get healed.
Taliesin: You don't roll; you get the max.
Marisha: Beautiful.
Matt: Okay. So ending Pike's turn brings us to the top. Vex, your turn.
Laura: Oh, great. Well, I've seen all the things explode. Fucking hell. I'm going to pull out my Vecna symbol, that necklace that we still had, and put it around my neck, because that fucking sphere is out and I don't know if it matters.
Matt: Okay, so you quickly throw it around your neck.
Laura: Do I still have control of the vine?
Matt: Currently, yeah.
Laura: Okay. And it's on the other side of the force?
Matt: This is true.
Laura: So I'm going to use it and I'm going to try to grab a hold of the guy-- the guy in gray is holding the force wall, right? But it probably is a concentration. The guy in red is holding the sphere.
Matt: Correct.
Laura: The guy in red is holding the sphere. I'm going to try to knock him down and see if I can break his hold on the sphere, maybe? Is that stupid?
Matt: He does not make his save. He isn't moved. It wraps around him and pulls him tight against the area where it is again, but it's barely shifted him, so he gets moved a few inches, but doesn't seem to affect him at all.
Laura: That's a bonus action. I still get an action.
Matt: Yep, and movement.
Laura: And movement. Oh god. I'm going to spread out. I'm going to come over here, maybe? Or here. Oh jeez. I don't know. I can't hit anybody! I'm going to wait. I'm going to hold my action until I see something getting through that fucking force wall.
Taliesin: Until there's something to hit.
Laura: So that I can attack him.
Matt: Sounds good. All right, Vex, that's the end of your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: I'm going to try and run through the Wall of Force. It's only five feet of my movement, and we'll see what happens.
Matt: All right, you slam face-first into a stone wall. Immediately, the anger fills through you, the familiar smell and taste of iron-like blood as you seem to have busted some element of your nose in the impact.
Travis: Probably some eyelids? Do I go anywhere? Not even an inch?
Matt: No.
Travis: What if I channel all the rage from my life, and I draw on the undead? Okay, cool. I'm going to turn around and run the other way.
Marisha: You didn't get through?
Travis: No, it didn't even give, apparently. (counting) 50, right there.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Grog?
Travis: Yeah, that ends my turn.
Matt: This guy turns around and begins to make his way up the stairs and move double dash, and disappears up the stairs.
Marisha: (screams in frustration)
Travis: We can't do anything. Nobody knows Disintegrate or anything?
Marisha: Whose turn is it?
Matt: That finishes that guy's turn. It is now Scanlan's turn.
Sam: I'm going to take a few steps forward. I will inspire Grog, I guess.
Travis: Or yourself.
Sam: I'm okay.
Travis: Really? Okay.
Sam: I'll sing to him. (singing) Don't mess with that big black ball, it can really fuck you up. I really hate that big black ball, all it better do is miss you, make it miss you.
Matt: Oh my god, that was not my intent in creating this encounter. Take your d12 inspiration die.
Travis: Thank you.
Sam: And I guess I'll Dimension Door, try to go through the Wall of Force. We've tried this before, Matt. Who knows how this shit works?
Travis: And the previous ruling was it worked.
Sam: Yeah, but that could have been a gentle nod.
Matt: The wording is important on this.
Liam: I think the cultist shits his pants and his brain explodes. I think that's in the book.
Matt: I've had to look this up very carefully. With elements like this wall, it's a targeting thing. You cannot target something that is in full cover, total cover, which being behind a wall is. Teleportation, however, you're the target and Dimension Door and Teleport is unaffected by that.
Sam: Matt fucking hates this.
Marisha: Get the runner!
Sam: I don't know where the runner went.
Marisha: He went that way.
Sam: I don't see him, right?
Matt: You saw him run away, you just don't know where he is at the moment.
Sam: Can I gauge roughly how far he went down that hall? Do I see down the hall?
Matt: Not from where you were over there.
Sam: So I'm going next to the red guy.
Liam: Also, if you get out of range of Vex, Vecna knows all.
Laura: Oh yeah. Stay within 60 feet.
Matt: All right, so you Dimension Door there. That's your action.
Sam: That's my everything.
Marisha: We've got to take out these guys' eyeballs.
Matt: That's the end of your turn. At which point, Odell, who's standing there currently, is physically sweating, concentrating on this sphere right now. Looks over and sees you appear and goes, "Viskorad, the little one made it through!"
Sam: Who are you calling little?
Matt: At which point, you glance over your shoulder and you can see that the darting, cloaked one stops and spins and faces towards you.
Sam: That's not good for me, guys.
Marisha: It's not good for you, but it's good for us. Fuck them up!
Travis: Oh god.
Matt: That's as far as they can get. However, it completely disintegrates the central pillar. It is obliterated, like it lays with a top part and a bottom part, but wherever the sphere passes through, about a good six inches around it is turned to dust and is gone.
Laura: Oh my god, what if we fail these rolls?
Matt: He's then going to go back around--
Taliesin: No, he's grappled.
Liam: No, he's grappled.
Matt: No, it doesn't grapple. It just moves things toward it.
Marisha: You're confusing Entanglement with Grasping Vine. Two totally different things.
Matt: He's backing up, and he's looking over at the sphere, concentrating on it. You can see the beads of sweat pouring down his face, and he's glancing over nervously at you, but smiling at the idea that his friend is returning. That's going to end his turn. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: Okay. Seeing Grog slam into that. Ugh, fuck. This is a pretty beefy spell, yeah? Force Wall? Should I do fifth or sixth level to dispel this? Okay. Fifth or sixth level? Sixth level. I'm going to Dispel Magic this wall.
Matt: Okay. As you focus and concentrate, you release the essence of the Dispel Magic, the burst of arcane energy casts forth, and falls harmlessly against the exterior.
Laura: It's a higher level.
Liam: It's a higher level.
Marisha: Higher than sixth level? The spell.
Matt: Didn't appear to have an effect on the wall.
Travis: Come on, maybe it needed to be something else.
Liam: No. He did what Scanlan does with Counterspell. He beefed it up.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: You can move.
Marisha: It's higher than seventh level? Did you have to roll?
Matt: No effect on it.
Taliesin: Okay, it's going to be okay. Everything's okay.
Liam: So about that long rest...
Marisha: I don't know now, you guys.
Laura: We're fucked.
Marisha: I move forward. I guess. I don't want to move that far forward. No, I don't move that far forward! (laughter)
Marisha: I don't want to die!
Matt: That finishes your turn, Keyleth?
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Liam: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Marisha: (singing) I want you to be alive.
Laura: Oh no, here they come.
Taliesin: Oh no, here they come.
Matt: They take minor damage being in the physical wall, but that's fine with them.
Liam: Boom, I attack! Sneak attack on the one near Keyleth.
Matt: Emerge. All right, so the one near Keyleth. Go for it.
Laura: What was I holding for? I was holding until I could attack something, or until I could get through the wall? I think it was through the wall.
Matt: The wall.
Liam: All right, 27 on that guy.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay. So that is three, plus three is six, so ten. (counting)
Taliesin: If we can hit them, they're probably squishy.
Matt: You took out one of three between just two of your surprise attacks.
Liam: 34 for the first hit, and I have the second paladin attack, so if it's not dead, I will attack again.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: That is eight for the second.
Matt: As it emerges from the wall, its blackened shadow form giving off small tendrils of dark black ether and abyssal energy, it reaches out to strike at Keyleth, and you immediately release two daggers in its direction. Both hit its form. It gives this pained sucking sound as you watch its beady, burning red eyes seem to blink in the pain, and it angrily lashes out at Keyleth, its form somewhat more disparate and unable to maintain a corporeal form.
Liam: When is Pike? Is it her turn? No? Okay.
Matt: No, she cast Beacon of Hope. So attacking against Pike. That is 21. What's her AC?
Laura: 23!
Matt: 23. It tries to strike at her, and she manages to take the shield and bash it away. The light from her mace arcing around causes it to flinch, and it actually strikes a little too wide. The one that's arcing towards you, Keyleth, that is fucking 16 again! Yeah, because it's plus six to hit. Okay. You dodge out of the way a second time. It's then going to move back into the wall over here. He's going to move back into the wall, as well. Both of you get reactions.
Laura: Pike definitely takes it. With her Mace of Disruption, she gets an extra 2d6 radiant damage.
Matt: All right, so roll an attack on that one.
Laura: That's a 21 to hit.
Matt: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Travis: I am wickedly out of my element. I'm running from an 8-ball.
Taliesin: We've got to get everyone away from that thing.
Laura: 27 for Pike.
Matt: 27 points of damage?
Laura: Is it a fiend or an undead? So it has to have a wisdom save of 15.
Matt: If it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, which it does not. That one has not taken a whole bunch of damage. However, it did take a relatively decent hit, and you watch as she swings the mace out. As it pulls back, where the mace impacts, it seems to almost evaporate part of the shadowed form, and it shrieks as it disappears into the wall.
Liam: For clarification, that is the one I hit, as well, right?
Matt: No, the one that you hit is where she was.
Liam: Oh, Pike hit the other one.
Matt: Correct. Keyleth, are you doing anything as a reaction?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to pull out my staff and do a Burning Hands on him. Dexterity saving throw.
Matt: Natural 20, so it takes half damage.
Marisha: Half damage.
Laura: Ooh, that's good. You did the six and the four.
Taliesin: And then there was a third one.
Marisha: And then there's a third one that is a six? Was that right? Six and six is 12, so 16.
Matt: 16 points of fire damage reduced by half which is eight, and even that impact seems to be lessened by the wraith-like being seemingly absorbing some of the heat from the impact.
Laura: Radiant damage is the bomb!
Taliesin: Radiant damage is what we need in here.
Matt: All righty, that ends their turn. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: I'm going to stay in my little cubby hole. I've got some good visual on a couple of these guys down here. I'm going to yell at everybody to get the fuck away from the ball. I'm going to hold my attack until something happens that's going to give me something to shoot at.
Matt: Okay, so as soon as an enemy reveals itself that you can shoot. Okay, that ends Percy's turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Fucking hell. I'm going to do the same thing except I'm going to move to here and wait for something to attack one of my friends.
Taliesin: That's awfully close to the ball.
Liam: I know it is. That's what I do. I'm waiting until one of them attacks one of my friends. One of the undead. I can't do anything about that. That's what I'm doing. That's my turn.
Matt: All right, Pike's turn.
Liam: Stupid, I know. That's what Vax does.
Laura: I can only do this as a bonus action so that she can have that up, right? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon. Should she do it at a second level? Okay, she's going to cast Spiritual Weapon up near the wall as a giant sword that looks like it's on fire.
Matt: Whereabouts? On the wall here?
Laura: No, near the wall, yeah. Up close to the wall so that she can attack as soon as that thing is down. And then she's going to hold her physical action until there's something that she can attack.
Matt: Okay, she's holding her physical attack?
Laura: Yeah, her mace.
Matt: Okay, that ends Pikes turn. Vex, you're up.
Laura: Oh, that's me!
Matt: Yeah, that's you, actually.
Liam: You're Vex.
Laura: I'm Vex. I'm going to dart away from this ball as fast as I can, and I'm going to come up here.
Sam: Hey, you broke through!
Laura: I broke through the wall. I can't reach. I'm too fucking-- It's fine; I got it.
Sam: Make Matt stand up, Laura.
Matt: Please do. I appreciate it.
Laura: And I'm going to hold my fucking attack until something comes out that I can attack.
Matt: Okay. All righty.
Marisha: I can't believe I couldn't fucking dispel that wall.
Matt: Grog, you're up.
Travis: Yeah, I am, aren't I? Okay. Cool.
Laura: Wait, I have bonus action still.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to use that Grasping Vine that I still have up, and I'm going to re-grab onto that stupid guy's fucking neck and yank him towards the wall he's right in front of.
Matt: That's a 15. What's your DC on that?
Laura: 15.
Matt: He succeeds, unfortunately. It slaps out towards him and this time-- I forget the adage, but never mind. He dodges it. (laughter)
Liam: It took 425 hours, but we did it. We broke his brain.
Matt: Blame it on the painkillers. The vine whooshes out and tries to wrap around him. He dodges out of the way, and it slaps harmlessly against the stone and withdraws back into the small crack of stone where it's based. That ends your turn. All right, Grog.
Travis: I'm going to put my faith in Scanlan that some sort of impossible miracle happens. (counting) 30. Right up against the wall. Can I look to the left down that hallway? Can I see down there at all? Is it blocking the hallway off from vision? Is that a moveable space?
Matt: Looking off, it looks like the orb was being used to carve a path.
Travis: It hadn't finished doing it?
Matt: No. It was maybe 25 or so feet down and was hitting solid rock.
Laura: My spell DC may be higher. I don't know if I have increased that in a while.
Liam: It's eight, plus proficiency bonus, plus her spell bonus.
Laura: So my spell DC is 17.
Matt: You need to keep up on that, girl.
Marisha: That was how I lost to Grog in our battle.
Laura: I wanted it around his neck, just to make him annoyed.
Matt: It hits him against the wall. He's still glancing over his shoulder.
Taliesin: He's lost visual range of the ball?
Matt: No, he can still look over the rubble there.
Travis: Not enough to make a concentration check?
Matt: If that's what it does.
Travis: I'm there. I can't get into that hole anymore, can I?
Matt: Not with the way the Wall of Force is placed, no.
Travis: Fair enough. I will hold my action until someone comes within melee distance.
Matt: Okay, ending Grog's turn. At the top of the staircase--
Laura: Oh no! He's coming back for Scanlan!
Matt: This guy here, we'll say he got about that far from the stairs and continues that way.
Marisha: Sanctuary!
Taliesin: Like he's parting the Red Sea.
Taliesin: You shall not pass!
Marisha: You shall not pass!
Laura: Oh my god, we're going against Gandalf right now, you guys.
Taliesin: That's not Gandalf. That's a cosplayer.
Liam: Do you know many hobbits I have under my cloak?
Taliesin: Five hobbits in a cloak. That's all it is. It's not a wizard.
Matt: He glances down at the staircase where you are, and as he begins to smile, the flash in the eye begins to glow briefly, a pale comparison to Vecna, but there is an essence of energy lent to him from his worship of the newly risen deity. He begins to speak in a language you don't understand. And as he speaks one alien word-- how many hit points do you have?
Sam: A lot. 167.
Matt: Fuck, okay. I miscalculated. No effect.
Sam: Power Word?
Matt: Power Word  Stun. He assumed the smaller stature of the gnome was not as hearty.
Travis: He's upset that he miscalculated. The DM wants blood!
Liam: That's what he gets for profiling.
Matt: He's going to continue moving upward, 30 feet back up into the staircase as he keeps focusing on you. That's going to end his turn. You're up, Scanlan.
Sam: Hold on. I need to look up the range of a fucking spell. How far is he from me?
Matt: It's hard to tell at this point. You'd say somewhere between 50, 60, 70 feet.
Liam: I bet your spell is 120 feet, Sam.
Sam: I'm looking. That one's not.
Liam: Is it Thaumaturgy? Because that's right where your eyes are.
Sam: You said how far? Oh shit.
Matt: Between 50 and 70 feet from you.
Laura: You can move.
Liam: You can move.
Sam: Yeah, I'm going to move 25 feet towards him.
Matt: Okay, so that puts you up here.
Sam: And with my darkvision, do I get a sense for how far he is from me now?
Matt: Yeah, you'd say he's about 40 feet from you.
Sam: Fuck no, it's not. Shit, I need 30.
Laura: You can move five more feet. You've got more movement.
Sam: No. That's my movement. I have tiny little nubs.
Travis: Tiny little nubs?
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: What about long-range shit, man?
Sam: That's okay. Yeah, I've got longer-range shit, but it's not as bad news.
Marisha: Keep them from running away.
Travis: Damn it, Matt. Why'd you have to back up?
Matt: Because that tactically made sense.
Liam: Bigby's Hand him? Grab him?
Sam: I'm thinking. I'm trying to decide between two things.
Travis: Yeah, do it. Take your time, baby. Take your time. Taliesin, give him a backrub. Come on, let's focus up here. There you go. Support. Feel the love.
Marisha: This is all on you, man. This is all on you.
Travis: Do your thing. Listen, Shadow of War comes out October 10th. A lot of us are in it.
Sam: It's going to have a lot of wisdom. All right. I will Bigby's Hand. I assume he's got a lot of wisdom, so I will Bigby's Hand him. At level seven. And I will punch the shit out of him.
Laura: Punch him back toward us. Bigby's Hand on the opposite side of him and punch him back toward us.
Marisha: That's a good call.
Matt: All right, so that is 8d8 force damage if you hit. Roll a melee spell attack.
Laura: Inspire yourself!
Taliesin: Inspire yourself!
Sam: I didn't. I forgot. I rolled an 18.
Matt: 18 hits. He's a caster; he doesn't have a lot of armor.
Marisha: Kill him!
Matt: All right, so roll 8d8 force damage.
Taliesin: I have three.
Sam: And I've got one.
Liam: That's just some dude from Sea Org in a bathrobe. Punch him!
Taliesin: Wow, that was a deep cut.
Sam: Wait. Shit. What did I just roll? 16 plus four. That's 20. And then this is another-- 40.
Matt: 40 points of force damage.
Sam: 40 points of force damage.
Matt: All right, that's a 20 DC concentration check.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: Come on.
Matt: 16. No.
All: Wall down!
Laura: Did we notice? Did we notice that the wall went down?
Matt: No, you don't see it.
Sam: I don't know. Right?
Matt: But Grog would feel it. Grog is sitting there waiting for something, as Bigby's Hand full-on sucker punches him in the body, and he slams against the steps and has to shake his head as he glances at the giant fist and down at you.
Sam: As a bonus action, can I do anything?
Matt: If you want to do a bonus action, you can't do Bigby's Hand again.
Sam: No, but can I throw something to see if it goes through the wall?
Matt: Sure. I'll let you do that. Roll an attack roll, just to aim it.
Sam: Sure. 17, plus I don't know.
Matt: What are you throwing?
Sam: Scanlan found these two really crappy daggers in the desk in the casino.
Matt: He pulls one of these jeweled daggers that he wore and throws it behind, and Grog, you watch as this dagger passes through.
Taliesin: I see that, and I take three shots at this fucker up here immediately. How far away is he?
Matt: Which guy? The who Bigby's Hand just punched? Okay, he is about 120 feet.
Taliesin: I'm going to use Bad News, then, because that is within range for my fucking sniper rifle. He's going to take that.
Laura: I'm going to shoot at the dude in red in front of me.
Taliesin: I can't use a bonus action, and I have to reload once, so I can only take two shots with my action. I can't take three. So two shots with Bad News. Here we go. That's a 25 and 27 to hit.
Matt: Both hit.
Taliesin: First shot is 22 points of damage. Second shot is not as good. 14 points of damage.
Matt: So as you fire those two shots, the echoing noise of Bad News's explosions echoes through the hallway and stairway above. Vex.
Laura: I'm going to sharpshooter him, the guy right in front of me.
Taliesin: There's a lot of noises going on in this place. I think it'll be okay.
Marisha: Oh, it's fine. There are tunnels collapsing and shit. It's fine. I'm not concerned about the noise at the moment.
Laura: 22 to hit?
Matt: 22 does hit.
Laura: 21 damage on the first. And then 19 on the second. That's also Sharpshooter.
Matt: Nice.
Laura: No, that's 19 to hit.
Matt: Gotcha. That hits.
Laura: 27 on the second.
Matt: All right, nice. The guy who's controlling the sphere, after the first arrow strikes him right in the chest, he looks and starts to run up the stairway, and as it does, you take aim with your second arrow and release it, and it hits the base of the skull. You watch him go down one of the stairs.
Taliesin: So the sphere is still there?
Matt: The sphere is still there.
Laura: But he doesn't have control over it anymore. This guy in red is down, so all that's left is the guy and the wraiths?
Taliesin: Was there a third guy?
Laura: We killed him. That was the first guy we killed.
Matt: That finishes Scanlan's turn, right?
Laura: Yeah, that was your turn.
Sam: Yeah, I'm done.
Matt: Keyleth's turn.
Marisha: Okay. I run up as far as I can, 30 feet. Do I see this motherfucker?
Matt: Yeah, you see him. You have a 60-foot range of darkvision?
Marisha: Or I see the glimmering of Bigby's Hand?
Matt: Yeah, I'd say you could probably see him okay. A little bit. It's very dark, but barely.
Marisha: Fireball! (laughter)
Taliesin: That's an answer.
Matt: As you rush up, from the edge of the staff, a bead of red light engulfs the hallway above in flames. You see a split second of him and Bigby's Hand's outlines before fire engulfs the space. Go ahead and roll damage on that. That's a natural 20 on his save, so he gets half damage.
Marisha: What the fuckballs?
Matt: I didn't even roll with advantage on that one.
Sam: You said Fireball on this guy? Bigby's Hand takes damage.
Marisha: Does he? Magical?
Sam: Yeah, he has hit points.
Taliesin: He could roll a save, though.
Sam: He could!
Matt: Let's check. Yep, it has no bonus, so you roll a d20 and see what you get.
Sam: 11.
Marisha: 29 points of damage.
Sam: It's fine. Bigby's Hand has 167 hit points.
Matt: Yeah, it has your hit points.
Laura: That's amazing!
Sam: Yeah, it's me.
Matt: That ends Keyleth's turn. He's still alive. This one's going to move through the hallway here.
Marisha: He's still going after my ass?
Matt: This one's going after Pike.
Liam: I get to attack. I've been holding.
Laura: Pike gets to attack. Pike has been holding her action to attack as soon as she could, too.
Matt: So Pike gets her attack, and so do you.
Laura: So 20 to hit on Pike.
Matt: 20 to hit? That hits.
Laura: Where is my other d8? Here it is. (counting)
Liam: When you hold, does bonus action carry over?
Matt: Nope, just the action.
Laura: So it's 22.
Matt: 22. All right. And what's the saving throw?
Laura: Saving throw is 15.
Matt: 15. Four, no. As it comes out of the wall reaching for Pike, she swings wide with the mace. As it slams into it, there's a flash of divine energy. Her eyes seem to pulse with a matching burst of radiant power, and as it hits, the creature squeals and squeaks as the light from the mace actually dashes it from this existence or any other. That is scattered into nothing from the shadows.
Liam: I rolled an 18 and a one.
Matt: 18 hits. One misses.
Liam: Okay, so sneak attack. One.
Sam: One misses?
Laura: I know, right?
Liam: 39 for the second attack.
Matt: 39 for the second attack. All righty. And with that, as this one reaches out towards Keyleth, your dagger strikes the back of its body, and as it impacts, you watch as its shadowed form turns into nothing but a splash of dark, half-existing ether, which then fades as your dagger clatters to the ground motionless.
Liam: Back to the belt.
Matt: All right. Percival, you're up.
Laura: Kill him!
Taliesin: Reload. Going to take another shot.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Going to take a shot. Yeah, let's take another shot. Probably got a low AC. Let's make this a sharpshooter, just for fun. Yeah. That's a sharpshooter shot, so that's a 24 to hit?
Matt: 24 hits.
Taliesin: All right. So let's do (counting) 26 points of damage.
Matt: 26 points of damage. (gunshot) The echo of the impact as you watch part of the lower jaw and throat of the cultist in the robe gets blown apart. He stumbles back onto the steps that he had barely started to get up off to and you watch and you hear the horrible coughing sound as his last moments of life are robbed of it as it tries to get back up and then stumbles right back and bleeds out against the steps.
Taliesin: We can still interrogate him. He doesn't have to be alive for that. Any other problems?
Liam: How's the ball doing?
Matt: It's hovering there in the center of the hall.
Laura: We can't do anything about that floating ball. Cover it with a handkerchief.
Marisha: You beat me to it, man.
Taliesin: Let's rifle through these guys' stuff. Which one do we want to interrogate?
Marisha: Keyleth goes up to the red robe.
Taliesin: Let's throw gray robe into the annihilation ball. Let's get rid of him.
Travis: Vax. Why don't you go down the hallway and see if anyone else is coming? Keep watch.
Laura: But stay within 60 feet. Everybody gather up around me again.
Liam: Sis, come up to where Scanlan is so I can go a little further ahead.
Matt: Everyone is barely still within 60 feet.
Taliesin: Everyone gather up. We're going to get our stuff.
Laura: Avoid the ball.
Marisha: Vax, can I borrow a dagger?
Liam: Yeah. I give her Whisper.
Marisha: I take it and I stab it in his other eye. Red robe guy.
Matt: Okay. (splat) Other eye is destroyed.
Sam: I'm going to use Bigby's Hand to grab the sphere.
Matt: Do you? Okay. Bigby's Hand reaches over and grabs towards the sphere, and as Bigby's form attempts to grasp the chaotic point of destructive energy, Bigby's Hand suffers 26 points of force damage and is forced to pull back.
Sam: That's not so bad.
Matt: But cannot grasp it. Cannot move it. (electrical shock)
Laura: I'm going to rifle through the robes of red robe.
Taliesin: I'm going to get Odell.
Matt: That's the one she's rifling through.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. There was a third guy, right, that they killed early on?
Matt: Oh, the first guy. Yeah. Okay, gotcha.
Taliesin: Assume we're going through everybody and taking their shit.
Liam: I'm standing as far from Vex as I can, but I can't go much farther because obviously-- yeah.
Matt: Okay. Interestingly enough, based on the current scenario and what preparation has been, no money on them. They have no worldly possessions that are what you consider of use. They each carry a gnarled wooden wand that they've been using as a focus for their spellcasting. Beyond that, they have nothing on them except for the one that you shot has, you notice the left hand is withered and gray, the skin is pulled taut against the bone. But beyond that, there is no other possessions on them, beyond the symbol of Vecna they wear around their throat.
Marisha: How many of those symbols do we still have, and how many robes do we still have?
Laura: Well, we can grab their robes, I don't know how many of those we have, but I think we also have a necklace.
Liam: Also, we can have Pickle talk to one of these arseholes.
Taliesin: I think that's a good idea.
Marisha: The guy that I'm standing over, red robe, I'm going to rip his necklace off.
Matt: Okay. You tear it off.
Laura: I'm going to take his robes.
Taliesin: Oh yeah, we're taking all this shit.
Matt: So you take every set of robes. And these robes are different from the robes that you had seen in Thar Amphala before. These appear to be a little more ornate. They seem to have a little higher station, which is why it's interesting that beyond the robes and some basic undergarments and the wand, they have nothing on them. They are a sheer conduit of their own power.
Taliesin: Were they drilling? I want to take a little bit of an inspection. Were they drilling with this thing? Is that why they had it?
Matt: Looking around the pathway, you can see that a lot of the staircase probably was more caved in, but has been cleared out by the movement of this orb. It's being used as a form of excavation tool as they push deeper into the catacombs here.
Marisha: So they were holding on to that orb the whole time.
Laura: Yeah, the guy in the red was controlling it.
Marisha: Yeah. He didn't cast it, though. We didn't see him cast that.
Laura: It came out of the wall.
Matt: Yeah, it came out of that little gap on the side there.
Sam: I'm going to go over to the sphere and say to it: I command thee to respect my authority and obey me as your new master.
Matt: Are you trying to exert your will on the sphere?
Sam: I'm intimidating the sphere.
Matt: Make an intelligence arcana check.
Sam: Intelligence arcana check?
Matt: Just an arcana check.
Sam: Oh! 19.
Matt: 19? And you're standing right next to the sphere to push your will into it?
Sam: Yeah, I came closer to it.
Matt: Okay. As you stand there, you focus on the orb, and you can feel your will push past the event horizon of the sphere. However, the force is too strong inside, and as you pull out of it instinctually, it moves towards you. (screaming)
Taliesin: Why did you have to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature?
Matt: Yeah. Ten feet. Which is right where you are, so I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Liam: Matthew McConaughey is going to reach out of it for you.
Sam: That's not good. 11.
Matt: 11?
Sam: Bigby, save me!
Matt: The orb pulls back and slams into the edge of his gnomish face and chest, and you watch as his flesh is pulled towards and disintegrated at the exterior of the sphere.
Laura: Can we reach down and grab him away from it?
Marisha: Yeah, Grasping Vine!
Matt: You take 30 points of force damage, and it's currently now right in your square, right up against you.
Laura: I use my Grasping Vine and I yank him away from it.
Marisha: Yeah, move away!
Matt: Okay. So you all push him out of the way and the vine pulls him.
Travis: Two-Face!
Matt: Yeah, you look a little rough.
Laura: Scanlan, you're hideous now.
Sam: Don't look at me! I'm fine.
Travis: Some other voice starts coming out of him.
Sam: I think I can take this thing.
Liam: "So did you want me to talk to one of these guys?"
Matt: You got the sense that there is a way to exert your will over it the way these guys did, but in that moment, your will faltered, and you didn't quite understand the nature of the sphere.
Sam: I just need to try again harder.
Marisha: Wait!
Laura: You got to roll higher than a 19. Can you give yourself inspiration?
Sam: This is an ability check, right?
Matt: This is an ability check, yes.
Taliesin: Wait, was that a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: No. It was an arcana check.
Travis: It might be high, dude. You might have to roll a 30.
Taliesin: Let's leave it. Tend to the sick and leave the well alone.
Travis: Indiana? Let it go.
Laura: Or Dominate that shit.
Sam: I'll try one more time.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: All right. Let's all back up.
Laura: I get ready with the vine to yank him away in case it starts moving toward him.
Matt: Okay. And everyone else backs up a little.
Marisha: Keyleth stares with a vague familiarity.
Sam: I'm going to inspire myself.
Matt: Okay. So make your roll first, as you begin to focus and exert your will towards it. You add it on to it.
Sam: Pretty good.
Laura: Now inspire!
Sam: And inspire?
Matt: Up to you.
Sam: Okay. Plus my what? Arcana?!
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Ooh, that's a lot. 30.
Matt: Okay. As you this time begin to push your will towards the sphere, you push past the event horizon, your consciousness connects with some--
Sam: (garbled) Listen to me, damn it! Respect my authority!
Matt: Some ancient space of the void within this blackened circle. As it connects-- What's your intelligence modifier?
Sam: Plus three.
Matt: Okay. What are you trying to will it to do?
Sam: I'm trying to will it to-- Shit, it's just a big black ball. Slam straight into the ceiling!
Matt: It moves up ten feet and then it hits, devours the stone above it to create this small tunnel right directly above.
Laura: Oh my god! You did it.
Sam: We can use it!
Taliesin: Finally.
Sam: Have you guys seen The Explorers?
Taliesin: I'm in The Explorers, motherfucker. I'm in The Explorers.
Sam: You are?! That's one of my favorite movies of all time! Can I get your autograph?
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Were you kidding? Are you really in The Explorers?
Taliesin: Yes! I'm really in The Explorers.
Liam: Stop the game!
Taliesin: I'm one of River's little brothers. I'm Ludwig.
Sam: Oh, wow!
Marisha: Yeah, he knew River through that.
Laura: What if we use the orb and go straight up? We don't even keep tunneling, we juat go straight up to the city.
Sam: It only listens to me.
Laura: Yeah. Do you need us to heal you or anything?
Sam: No, this is a cool thing.
Travis: Yeah, but it only makes a hole its size. It's two feet across.
Taliesin: I think he's not ready to pop a wheelie on this thing yet.
Travis: Plus, remember the guy was concentrating super hard, so it's the only thing Scanlan will probably be able to do.
Marisha: But if he cores out a tunnel for us, we can carry Scanlan like on a palanquin? Like We Are The Champions?
Sam: Guys, I think we can make it. No, we can't! We'll never make it! Yes, we can!
Liam: All I'm thinking is I could come up and do Lay on Hands and heals, but I'm like, you made your bed, lie in it.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. I'm okay with this.
Laura: What do you think? Do you want to go up?
Sam: We're still investigating these guys and stuff.
Marisha: Fuck these guys! We got all their shit. Let's go!
Sam: I'm going to call this ball Simon 3.
Travis: Do we know how far the sphere can move in a single movement?
Matt: You watched him push it, and it went about 15 feet.
Travis: The sphere can only move 15 feet.
Sam: It will slow us down.
Matt: It's a very slow-moving ball of destruction.
Taliesin: Bring the sphere back down so that we can throw their bodies into the sphere so that they don't turn into undead fuckwads.
Liam: Wait a second, though! God, I don't know what this will do. I have a spell called Zone of Truth.
Laura: So it forces them to speak the truth? Does it work on undead?
Liam: A creature that enters the spell's area for the first time. If it fails.
Laura: So you could cast it, and then Pike could cast Speak with Dead, and it would come up into the Zone of Truth.
Liam: That's right.
Travis: No, they have to tell the truth when you do Speak with Dead.
Liam: No, they don't.
Matt: They don't have to.
Marisha: They can lie.
Taliesin: Here's a weird question  what saving throw do they have to make to speak the truth?
Liam: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. So it could avoid the questions.
Laura: But they have to answer the questions.
Liam: But they have to answer the questions because of the other spell.
Laura: Right?
Sam: Double mumbo-jumbo?
Matt: It can't tell a lie, as you're discussing this. Technically, a creature would be unable to lie in the area.
Liam: Unable to lie, and with Pike's spell--
Laura: They have to answer the question.
Liam: They have to answer the question.
Matt: Let me double-check for you.
Taliesin: And what's the save?
Liam: Charisma saving throw against my spell save DC, which is not huge.
Marisha: What is it?
Liam: 16.
Matt: I mean, it does have to answer.
Liam: I like it.
Taliesin: Are we going to try this crazy shit?
Laura: Let's do it!
Marisha: Might as well. Okay, hang on, though! What are we going to get from this guy?
Laura: Find out how close we are to Vasselheim.
Taliesin: Yeah, what's the plan? What are they trying to do?
Liam: What has Vecna got cooking?
Taliesin: What's Vecna planning? How many of them are there?
Marisha: I'm going to go pee, you guys.
Liam: He might not know everything. How long does it take for Keyleth to pee?
Laura: No, but how close we are to Vasselheim? What's the plan of attack in Vasselheim? How big is his army? We get five questions, I think, with Speak with Dead.
Taliesin: Five?
Sam: How close are we? What's his plan? Where is he?
Laura: Where is Vecna within the city?
Sam: Who's with him?
Laura: Who's the death knight?
Taliesin: He might not know that. But what are they excavating for? What are they looking for?
Travis: I think I know that.
Taliesin: I think I know, too, but I want to hear him say it. It'd make me feel better.
Laura: Let's do it! Cast your Zone, yo!
Taliesin: Get in the zone.
Laura: (singing) Autozone!
Matt: (chuckling) Autozone of Truth?
Liam: Shit. So can anyone drag him down on his roll to save, or boost me?
Taliesin: No. Not me.
Laura: I don't think so.
Liam: Does anyone have a cantrip? Okay. All right. Let's do it.
Matt: All right. So which one?
Liam: Well, first Zone of Truth, then Pike.
Matt: Okay. So you create the Zone of Truth, you create the area, the radial space where the divine energy kicks in and the compulsion to not lie remains within. And then Pike--
Laura: Casts Speak with Dead.
Matt: On which corpse? There are three corpses.
Liam: Red robe seemed more fancy.
Sam: Who seemed more senior?
Liam: Red robe did.
Matt: There are three, technically.
Sam: There was the guy they killed right when they burst on the scene.
Taliesin: We'll take the fanciest cloak.
Matt: Okay. It's relative, but the guy who was controlling the sphere seemed to be at least different.
Laura: He had a different color. Yeah, red robe.
Matt: All right. So as Pike takes the time to focus and recite the incantation, she grabs her holy symbol and focuses and speaks aloud the words in Celestial of the blessing of Sarenrae. And as she completes the ritual, she suddenly screams out in pain and grabs at her head and falls to her knees. No effect. And she suffers--
Laura: Oh no! What did he do to Pike?
Travis: Oh shit.
Matt: On 6d6, I rolled four sixes and a five. That's 31 points of psychic damage to Pike.
Liam: She tried to cast Speak with Dead Dumbfuck.
Matt: She's shaking and grabbing her face and rubbing her eyes, and it takes her a moment to come back to you and she looks around, and you can see a faint bit of blood slightly dripping out of the corner of her eyes. She's like, "All I heard was laughter."
Sam: Laughter?
Laura: And you said it was minus 36 damage?
Matt: 31.
Liam: Vecna is in these motherfuckers' brains.
Marisha: Everyone looks upset.
Laura: Pike got psychic damage from that dude.
Marisha: How much? A lot?
Laura: 31 points of psychic damage.
Marisha: Oh, that's a lot, yeah.
Taliesin: Burn the bodies. Fuck it.
Marisha: Throw them down the well.
Taliesin: Throw them into the sphere.
Marisha: Oh yeah!
Sam: Sphere! Do your worst.
Matt: One by one, you grab and take the corpses and thrust them towards the sphere, as they immediately crumple, fold and get pulled in, turned to nothingness, disappearing into the black void. There are elements of the way the sphere acts and manipulates things that remind you of the siphons, though differently. It's more violent in some ways, and it is its own contained magical entity. With each body, it vanishes in the sphere, and you all sit there for a moment taking a breath and deciding the next order of business in traversing the insides of this titan. And that's where we'll end tonight's game, because it's 11:30.
Marisha: I feel like I always come back from the bathroom right as we're ending games.
Sam: First of all, it's so great to be back!
Taliesin: It's so nice to be back.
Sam: Matt, thank god you're totally 100 percent healed and all better again.
Matt: It's great. Sorry. But yeah, missed you guys. We'll be back next week, pick up from here, see as the final charge gets closer and closer. What will you guys do next time? In the meantime, rest well, don't forget, if you can, to give to the Red Cross to help support the victims of recent hurricane battering in the US.
Laura: Look for Shadow of War.
Matt: Shadow of War coming out on October 10th.
Marisha: Our comic on Wednesday.
Matt: Yep, look for that. And we'll see you guys soon. Have a wonderful week, we love you, and: Is it Thursday yet? Good night. [music]

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Glad you could join us for what is essentially the final and epilogue episode of our five-year campaign. We're excited you guys could come join us.
Sam: Not the final episode of the show!
Matt: We will return. We're looking probably at the start of the new year with a new campaign, new characters.
Laura: But we'll have one-shots and stuff in between.
Matt: Yeah, we'll have fun stuff to break it up and give us some time to let off some steam in the meantime. But before we get into tonight's game, let's get through some quick announcements. First off, we wanted to give a shout out. If you guys haven't seen it yet, Shadow of War just came out, the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. A bunch of us have worked on it and if you haven't seen, we had the opportunity to do a cool thing with WB Games and the folks at Monolith. We did a Shadow of War one-shot that was uploaded as a two-parter.
Laura: It was so much fun!
Liam: You were so cute, all of you. It was the cutest orc adventure that ever happened.
Sam: You watched it?
Liam: Both episodes.
Laura: Thanks bro!
Matt: It was a lot of fun. We had Sam, Laura, Travis, and the illustrious Darin De Paul as our four orcs and/or olog-hai, charging their way through Mordor in hopes of victory spoils and all that.
Laura: It's real fun to be stupid.
Travis: I don't know what you're talking about.
Matt: So I recommend checking it out if you haven't yet. Merch update, Laura?
Liam: Wait! Something I can say now. I didn't have the green light, but I am in that game. I had to fib and say that I wasn't in that game, but I'm in that game! I am back as Gollum! And I run around and I do this, and I do this, and I do this, and I do this. (Gollum voice) Tasty fish!
Matt: If you guys haven't seen Liam's Gollum in the games, it's the most ridiculous--
Travis: Also to point out, you did the full mo-cap for it. Not just the VO.
Liam: Broke my back, scuttled around like I was a young buck, which I'm not. It was great!
Laura: I wish I still had the video of you that you sent me after you first started, yeah. When he first started playing Gollum, he sent me this video of him running around his living room, jumping up on his couch, then running over and jumping up your entertainment system or something.
Liam: I put my laptop on the coffee table, I hit click, and I started going--
Laura: It was so amazing.
Liam: Because I'm a nerd.
Matt: Awesome. Well, thank you for the follow-up on that, Liam. Laura?
Laura: Oh, well, technically, I have to shove this one to Liam and Taliesin, as well.
Taliesin: I feel like we've been doing the thing for a while now.
Liam: Yeah, like when parents have a baby, you don't see them for a while. They're with that baby every hour, every minute. (yelling)
Liam: Oh my gosh, it's the new art book! Oh my god, it's gorgeous! I took it out of the Ark of the Covenant, and here it is!
Laura: Okay, I should qualify this, because it's not in the store yet, you guys, so don't go to the store and freak out. It just came into the office.
Liam: Yeah, this is just our viewing copy. There will be more details--
Sam: What does it say on the title there?
Liam: It says The Chronicles of Exandria  The Tale of Vox Machina. One.
Sam: Volume One? Implying that there's going to be more?
Taliesin: Implying that we'd like to.
Liam: We'd like there to be. And you guys can tune in next week to Talks Machina, where we will have more info, more details.
Laura: We'll say when they're going to go in the store.
Matt: Can you give a teaser flip of any pages?
Liam: I have been told that I cannot give a teaser flip. But wait, guys. There's more! Taliesin, if you would?
Taliesin: Well, we did two editions because we wanted to do something a little ridiculous. And so--
Sam: What is this? A special edition?
Taliesin: This is a special edition. It's a little more fancy. It's got the ribbon and leather and gold foil. It's got an evil tome vibe, and it's got lots of little wonderful details.
Liam: We have held that book and looked through it. I cried 97 times in one minute. It is so beautiful.
Marisha: It really looks like crying for 60 seconds.
Laura: Tune in to Talks Machina on Tuesday. We'll give you more details about how you can purchase them. And you can always check out geekandsundry.com/artbook for more updates. They're coming soon. They should be in the warehouse very soon, so that's happy for the holidays.
Liam: Joe Madureira art!
Laura: I'm excited!
Taliesin: Yeah, there's lots to talk about in these books. I'm very excited!
Travis: And to cure any freakout, Ashley is going to join us. She's finishing up.
Matt: Finishing up shooting on Blindspot. So she'll pop in when she can.
Laura: This is her day job!
Taliesin: We keep trying to tell her that, don't we?
Liam: Wait. There's one last thing.
Sam: Two more editions of the art book!
Liam: I got one last thing, for funsies. It's a really late birthday present. It's kind of for funsies, but Travis, I have something for you that I've been wanting to give you for a while.
Sam: Is that an experience?
Travis: Can I open it?
Liam: Yeah, go for it.
Travis: What the fuck is this? (gasps)
Sam: Is it the Belt of Dwarvenkind?! (yelling)
Laura: Look at how big the face is!
Travis: Oh my god! Hug me through my wife! That's so great! I can't get hit in the dick with this on! This is amazing! It really covers the whole kit and kaboodle!
Liam: And your beard will double in length the moment you put it on. I had to repay you for the raven mask you gave me, once upon a time.
Laura: Oh yeah, our drunken ren fair purchases. I was like, "that's a cool mask! Where'd you get it?" And you said, "you got that for me."
Liam: Your husband just bought this for me! Thanks, Laura!
Matt: There you go. Also immune to poison. Good job. Perfect! So other updates. We are officially announcing the second edition of Vox Machina: Origins, the Critical Role comic. It's going to be available October 18th, so look for that on all your great comic book-- Comixology, the Dark Horse app, and all the other places that I can't think of right now. But yeah, so super exciting. This one starts bringing in some of the other members of Vox Machina who didn't show up in the first issue. So take a look at it, hope you guys enjoy. Let's see. Other quick announcements. Wednesday Club, Taliesin, you have coming up?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's October, so we're doing Halloween. We're doing Hellboy, which I don't really know much about. I couldn't think of anybody who knew a lot about Hellboy. Do you know a lot about Hellboy?
Liam: I know a lot about Hellboy.
Taliesin: Do you want to come on Wednesday Club?
Liam: Yes, please! Oh! I bought a Hellboy comic today! Another black compendium book to go with my other big black blades on my shelf.
Matt: Liam likes things that are big and black.
Laura: I'm glad your mind went there, too.
Taliesin: It's going to be Wednesday Club on Hellboy.
Matt: Then you have something on Friday, as well?
Taliesin: I do! I've decided it would be really funny to be here really late three days in a row for the rest of my life, and so I'm-- I don't want to quite say "taking over." Is "taking over" the word?
Marisha: That's fair.
Taliesin: I'm taking over Gather Your Party on Friday nights now, and we're giving it a bit of a revamp. It's going to be a bit of a different vibe. It's going to be a little shorter. It's going to be fun. Our very first episode is going to be called Gather Your Goth, and we're going to be giving some of our friends goth makeovers and having a goth dance contest.
Laura: Can I get made over? When are you doing it?
Taliesin: Tomorrow night.
Laura: Shit, I'm not going to be here! Fuck, I really want to be made over!
Taliesin: Well I'll tell you what. You let me know, and you can come over and have a goth makeover.
Matt: Next time you do it, you do whatever it's called, and then in parentheses Laura Your Goth, or Goth Your Laura.
Taliesin: Gather Your Laura. You would goth out very well. I think I would be excited by that.
Matt: All right. To finish this up, let's see. I forgot to mention it last week, but those of you guys who have been playing the Telltale Batman game, the new Pact episode came out recently with Harley Quinn and Bane, and I play Mr. Freeze! It's been a lot of fun, and I've been continuously recording on it. Hope you guys enjoy more fun to come with that delightful character.
Liam: You do have a cold heart.
Matt: It's true. Then you guys had a Sagas of Sundry announcement?
Marisha: Oh yeah! Sagas of Sundry announcement! Cast list went out! Who's in it? We are!
Liam: I didn't see you there at all!
Marisha: Look again! Abigail Persimmon.
Taliesin: The magic of the goth makeover strikes again! (cackles)
Marisha: I'm not coming tomorrow because I've already had mine.
Taliesin: No, I bought this shirt when we went shopping.
Marisha: That's right! You did! We went on a shopping trip, and we had so much fun.
Liam: It was fucking wild.
Marisha: Anyone who hasn't seen any of the first season--
Matt: Thanks for keeping tally.
Travis: He picked his cup up without drinking it again! Picks it up. (thunk)
Liam: Like an animatronic sailor!
Matt: Like a raccoon that can't find a river, I go through the motions of washing my food. All right. Couple of other things. It is still Sub-tober, because why not? That means if you haven't had the opportunity to subscribe to any of the Twitch streams that you're a fan of, you can do so half off until the 18th. So you can do that up until the 18th and then get the comic the same day, I guess. And since this is the final episode of the campaign, I wanted to give a shout out to all our fantastic crew. Wonderful people who have worked their ass off to stay here late every Thursday. We have Maxwell James, Dani Carr, Jason Corey, Ryan Green, Selina Ruth, Chris Wilmont, Zach Wilson, Sax Carr, Mark Donica, Anthony Videsco, Courtney Kraft, Ian Kagihara, Chris Lockey, Holly Pearson, Ryan Porter, Denise, J. Andrew Bernard, Ed Lopez, Rachel Romero, all of our fantastic mods who have done an incredible job maintaining the chaos that is Twitch, you guys are fantastic. We really appreciate all the hard work you guys put into it, and many, many more. The entire community, we can't even begin to express--
Laura: Did you say Fernando?
Matt: Yes, I did. Wait, Fernando. Someone didn't put Fernando on the list!
Sam: And many more whose names were omitted.
Matt: Correct, thank you guys so much for all your hard work!
Liam: Wait, let's come up with some more announcements so we never have to start.
Matt: Nope, I think we've stretched the audience's patience enough. Let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Liam: Autoerotic a-pixie-ation.
Matt: You were real late on the draw, but this is the night to do it. I guess.
Liam: Right on time.
Matt: It was perfect. Precisely when you mean to. All right. Last we left off, Vox Machina, through their trials and tribulations, had eventually come to realize the machinations of Vecna, who ascended into godhood, transported his city from the Shadowfell of Thar Amphala to the top, right above a long-dead earth primordial titan, rising it and making its way toward Vasselheim, the Dawn City, the beginning of creation. You battled your way through its innards, up within the arcane dome that protected it, managed to defeat one half of the long-frustrating Briarwood coupling, fought your way to the top of the tower Entropis, did battle with Vecna, the Ascended. Through careful planning and sacrifices, you managed to apply the trammels, complete the sealing ritual, and send Vecna screaming across the Divine Gate, to be sealed to wherever his divine demi-plane resides on the other side. As you all fell down upon the ruined, floating platforms of the tower Entropis, you glanced over as your recent ally, Arkhan the Cruel, proceeded to sever his own hand, attach the Hand of Vecna, and catching you off guard, transport himself beyond your current reach. This beat of intensity releasing slowly, the adrenaline still wearing its way through your veins, you sit in silence, looking about, amazed that you all still stand after such a confrontation. It's at that moment you hear this distant explosion. Glancing off the side of the platform you're on, you can still see, while the large titan, one of four arms raised, attempting to come and destroy all of you with one large blow, frozen in place, there still remains the dregs of Vecna's army down below throughout the city of Vasselheim, where battles are still raging in the streets. You can still see wyvern-riders and eagle-riders in the sky, though it appears that the gloomstalkers that once paraded across the skies over the city have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of the ascended god that summoned them. You also still are aware of the body of your sister, residing on the platforms below. It's at this point that you notice that the green tendrils of energy that hold the Tower of Entropis together begin to flicker and subside. The platforms that were slowly drifting, listing, suddenly begin to shift.
Laura: No! I take off on my broom, and I go down to try to get her.
Matt: Okay. You guys dart over the side. What are the rest of you guys doing?
Travis: I had the immovable rod pulled out, and I click it where I am.
Matt: All right. You hold in place. You feel the platform give beneath you. Your toes are now dangling in the middle of the air as you watch the cracked-open right side of Entropis' peak begin to topple and fall beneath you. What are you guys doing?
Marisha: I'm still a planetar. Do you still have Bigby's Hand up?
Sam: For maybe 30 seconds more.
Taliesin: Where's the carpet?
Travis: It's in my bag.
Marisha: I do a potato sack hold on Scanlan. Make sure he's all right.
Matt: You grab him. Pike still has some time. She still has her wings.
Travis: I can throw it to you.
Taliesin: That would be nice. Yes, please.
Travis: Can I pull the carpet out of the bag of holding? Do you want to free fall and go after it?
Matt: By the way, the platform is now giving underneath you.
Sam: Why don't you fly it over?
Travis: I don't think I can be on it with him. Right? I'm still enlarged.
Marisha: Here, can one of us fly over and get it?
Laura: Technically, he was on the broom with me, so I could've dropped him off with one of you before I flew down to Velora.
Matt: As you're having this conversation about the carpet, you're dragged down over the side as the broom rockets off, Vex's mind currently focused more on other things. So the last thing you hear from Percival is, "Could you throw--" as he darts off to the side. The platform is beginning to give as the flickering green energy begins to fade. You guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the rubble, where the top staircase had broken apart from the original sundering of the top of the tower. There you see, still lying there, lifeless, the body of Velora. You rush in there just as the platform's collapsing. I need you both to make acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you can maneuver in and out.
Laura: Okay, it's 30.
Liam: 31.
Matt: Both of you guys rush inward. As some of the various chunks are beginning to fall and separate from underneath the platforms, you begin to dart through, dodge, and you grab and lift her body. Both of you cradling her, and at a moment's notice, deciding which one of you's going to take her.
Liam: I've got her.
Matt: All right. Vax, you go ahead and dart off. You careen back out of the way as the central, large platform crashes down with a heavy impact. You can see it crumble, then break, and three separate pieces beginning to tumble. The tower then gives in from underneath and begins to collapse downward, almost like a controlled demolition. As it begins to fall and topple down below, you all gather your thoughts and consider other allies that were recently--
Travis: Falling?
Matt: A short time ago, yes.
Laura: Zahra and Kash?
Marisha: With Scanlan in hand, start diving down to go see if I can find them or have any sight of them at all.
Matt: What's the flying speed of your planetar?
Marisha: 150 feet.
Matt: Okay. As you, holding Scanlan under your arm, coast down at a speed to the point where now you're actually racing the crumbling of the tower. You're watching the actual cracks as they emerge, as the energy's dissipating, beginning to subside, as your speed overtakes the rate in which it's collapsing.
Marisha: Like Superman and Lois Lane.
Matt: (laughter). The G's are intense, Scanlan. Your eyes are watering, blown back on your face. The Ioun symbol on your forehead is flaring like a spotlight ahead of you. As you rocket down, you glance, you can see there across the rocks at the bottom, two wyverns that are scattered across the rubble, and you see, lying there, the bodies of Kashaw and Zahra.
Sam: They're dead. Turn around. Let's go back. They're dead.
Marisha: Shut up, Scanlan! Are they dead?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: How high am I hanging off of this thing?
Matt: Make--
Travis: A perception check? I am a million-- eight.
Matt: You're high up there. That's a long way up.
Marisha: 18.
Laura: You can use the carpet because Percy's on the broom with me.
Matt: Their bodies are brutalized from the impact. They hit.
Marisha: They're splatted.
Matt: Well, they're not splatted.
Laura: They're not you on the cliff.
Marisha: Sure. They didn't goldfish it.
Travis: But a good Revivify might help.
Sam: They're unconscious?
Matt: You're just now approaching. As you get there, you can hear the rumbling of the tower getting louder. You've barely beaten it. What are you doing?
Marisha: I've got to move them, right? Is that what you're saying? Scanlan? You're fine, right? Handle yourself?
Matt: Scanlan, she sets you on the ground as you look over and see the tower (crashing).
Marisha: Do you want to hold onto my back?
Sam: I have no spells left, so yes. (laughter)
Sam: I will climb on.
Taliesin: I imagine Scanlan dropping that last potion as it's coming down.
Matt: Okay. As you dive on, you grab both of their limp bodies and pull them under your arms and dart. I need you to make a dexterity saving throw, please.
Laura: Oh my god, if we thought we made it out of this--
Marisha: Okay, 18. No, wait! Yeah, 18.
Matt: 18. You manage to scoot by as one of the large chunks of the base falls over to one side, and as you dart out, wings before you, Scanlan clutched on your back, both their bodies beneath, you can feel the gust of wind from behind as the collapsing wall is pushing all the air in your direction. As you focus down, your wings out, you manage to careen underneath as the shadow that was beginning to fall over you pulls behind, and behind you hear the (boom), the dust pick up, and you guys all look down and watch as the tower finally falls to its final piece of rubble there on the ground. At which point you glance down, and you can see both of them, their eyes roll open, lolling in their face, both Zahra and Kashaw, seemingly conscious. If you guys want to step in? (cheering)
Marisha: I'm going to immediately burn two of my healing touches, and you get 6d8 plus three hit points back.
Matt: Kashaw and Zahra, you've been lying there on the ground for a moment going, "Ow," and as your vision focuses, you watch as the tower begins to collapse downward in your direction. The shadow seems to close over you.
Will: Well, that's not good.
Marisha: 29 hit points to both of you immediately.
Matt: And with a flash, something white-feathered and blue shoots past you, grabs you, and you are thrust into the air, carried by the angelic form of Keyleth.
Mary: Kiki? How are you, darling?
Marisha: Did you recognize me because of the antlers? That's why I keep them. They're very identifying.
Mary: I think I dreamed of you.
Marisha: No, that was real and incredible, and you all showed up.
Sam: Why did you come?
Will: We had to come. She made us. (laughter)
Mary: I had a vision.
Will: It's good to see you. Thank you for that.
Sam: You had a vision?
Mary: I did. I had a vision of white wings, and blue--
Will: Are you okay?
Mary: I think we're all right.
Will: Both of you?
Mary: Yeah.
Will: Don't piss off a pregnant tiefling.
Marisha: Yeah-- wait, what?
Will: Thank gods for that.
Sam: Haven't you heard of pulling out? (laughter)
Sam: I do it all the time!
Will: I tried. Didn't work.
Mary: I wouldn't let him.
Will: The tail held me in place.
Mary: You always said you liked that.
Will: Can you put us down somewhere, maybe?
Mary: That would be lovely, thank you.
Marisha: I drop Kash, but very lightly set down Zahra.
Matt: You tumble.
Marisha: Congratulations!
Mary: Did we win?
Matt: No, you're healed up; you're fine. The Death Ward brought you guys to one hit point, and then she healed you before she dropped you, so you're fine.
Will: No, I deserved that. Thank you. So did we win? What happened?
Sam: We're sitting on the titan now?
Matt: You're down in the street level of Thar Amphala.
Sam: But still on the Titan?
Matt: Still on the top of the Titan.
Sam: Is he falling?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Sam: Two.
Matt: You have no idea.
Sam: Pregnant?! What? I thought you were gay!
Will: We've talked about this. It's all right.
Travis: Can I take out the carpet and start making my enlarged form way down to them? By myself?
Laura: Well, Pike's with you.
Travis: Oh. Is she?
Laura: Yeah, Pike's still with you up there.
Travis: She's got wings.
Matt: With a strength of 19, and your enlarged size--
Travis: Can I dispel the enlarged?
Matt: No.
Travis: Oh, it's in for ten minutes. I'm just me. (laughter)
Matt: You get the sense, at this size, that carpet cannot carry you.
Travis: I'm just hanging out. I grab the earring and I say: Will someone please do me a favor? Will you look for Arkhan's hand? Find me that hand.
Sam: Is it falling?
Matt: It was on one of the platforms.
Marisha: Wait, you want to find his hand on the giant tower full of rubble?
Will: Whose hand?
Travis: Arkhan's.
Liam: Vex or I can find it.
Laura: In a moment.
Matt: At this point, you have both come down now to the base of the tower. At that speed, it took you a while to catch up to the rest of everybody else.
Marisha: I look up and say  Grog, do you need a hand? Are you all right? Damn it, the pun wasn't intended, Scanlan! (laughter)
Travis: I literally just said that.
Marisha: Do you need assistance getting down from hanging from a bar? In the middle of the air, to be very literal.
Travis: Yeah, it would be nice.
Marisha: I fly up.
Matt: So your angelic wing maneuver.
Mary: I can cast Fly on him.
Sam: Yeah, do that! Zahra has Fly, she can cast Fly on him!
Mary: I cast Fly on Grog.
Matt: Okay. You'll have to get up a little closer to do it, because you're out of range.
Mary: Can I use my Cloak of the Bat to fly up and then cast?
Matt: Yeah.
Mary: I fly up and I cast. Hello, darling!
Matt: You watch as Zahra, suddenly her cloak extends into two large, leathery bat wings and she flies her way up pretty close to where you are. For a second there, you glance down. Roll a perception check.
Travis: Ten.
Matt: You see a gloomstalker coming right at you.
Travis: (screams)
Matt: As you hold the sword out in front, you notice in a second, it's Zahra.
Travis: Oh. Not a gloomstalker.
Matt: But the sword, at this point, as you hold it out in front of you and push back, it goes, "One part is done. Well played. But he still survives. We'll take him. And we'll take that dragon. The hand must be destroyed. It's still out there. Together--"
Travis: Okay, yeah, I sheathe him. (laughter)
Travis: I need some Visine bad.
Mary: Grog! Hello, darling.
Travis: Hey, Zahra.
Mary: Did you ever use that moonhammer I gave you?
Travis: All the time. Covered in blood.
Mary: Right. In the moonlight, right?
Travis: Yep. Need to get it cleaned.
Mary: Good. Well, I look forward to hearing your tales. Do you need some help, my darling?
Travis: I do, unless you just want to hang out with me up here for a bit.
Mary: Well, I could. How is your arm? You know what, no, let's just do it. I cast Fly. Let go.
Matt: And you can fly. You're gliding in the air. (laughter)
Matt: He starts slowly--
Taliesin: Don't leave the rod!
Laura: Don't leave the rod!
Marisha: Don't leave the rod!
Travis: How do I do this?
Mary: It's all right. Just focus. Focus. You'll be fine, Grog. Just focus. Yes, think of yourself as a cow. As a flying cow. You remember?
Travis: Moo.
Laura: Grab the rod.
Travis: Oh, right. (click) Put it back in the bag of holding. This is great! Oh my god, I would do this every day.
Mary: Well, you could do it for at least an hour, so that's good.
Travis: Can I drunkenly fly down to everybody else?
Matt: And you do, it's a slow spiral, and you begin to gimbal backward, and she has to right you a couple times.
Travis: Can I fly right as I get closer, just for dramatic effect?
Mary: Focus on me. No squirrel. There's no squirrels. Focus your mind. No. It's all right, just come down. (singing)
Travis: I come down!
Mary: All right, you could do that, too. Look out below!
Travis: Three-point landing. Super hard.
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Travis: Super hard.
Will: Superhero landing.
Travis: (high voice) Not great.
Taliesin: Yay!
Laura: Not bad.
Travis: Oh, not bad, yeah. Yeah. 14.
Matt: 14. Okay. You were rage-hanging? You take 24 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to 12.
Laura: And Grog is dead.
Matt: And three-point landing. You watch as a crater is left beneath where his impact is. The smoke slowly subsides, and Grog's there, fist in the ground, Thor: Ragnarok style.
Laura: And we're all on the ground now?
Matt: You are all now on the ground floor of Thar Amphala. As you glance around--
Liam: I'm flexing the wings out and around, and I'm making a feather bed with the ends of the wings on the ground and laying Velora down on it.
Laura: Kash, tell me you have Revivify. Tell me you can bring her back.
Will: I believe I do.
Liam: I start combing her hair with my fingers, out of her eyes.
Will: Let me check. I do. Who am I casting it on?
Laura: Our sister.
Will: Oh. Oh, that doesn't look good. Yeah, okay. Let's see what we can do. I'm sorry, I'm still a little sore.
Laura: No. It's terrible. Please help her.
Will: It was a terrible fall. Give me one second.
Mary: I'm so sorry.
Will: Oh. Her? This one? Yeah, all right. Let's do that. I'm going to cast Revivify.
Matt: Okay. Unfortunately, she's been dead longer than a minute, so the spell does not take effect. You don't know how long it's been, or if perhaps your final moments of fucking with her was just enough to push it over the edge-- (laughter)
Will: It keeps happening! Sorry.
Sam: 61 seconds.
Will: I can speak to dead, if you'd like to talk with her.
Laura: No! I don't want to fucking talk to her, I want to have her back! (laughter)
Will: It's time for one message. Does she owe you money? I can have her find out where it is.
Liam: Do you have anything a little more potent right now?
Marisha: I can raise dead.
Will: Well, there we go. See?
Laura: Is she going to come back as a zombie?
Marisha: No.
Laura: She'll be a normal--
Taliesin: Just raised.
Marisha: I might need some help. Where's Pike?
Will: I can raise the dead, too, if you need help.
Matt: Pike has been slowly flying down.
Marisha: She doesn't come back as a zombie, right? It's raising dead.
Matt: Is it the actual Raise Dead spell?
Will: Mine is.
Marisha: It says three times a day.
Matt: Raise Dead. You can bring someone back to life, yeah. It takes an hour to cast.
Marisha: Yep.
Travis: Do they murder someone when you do that, like a horror movie?
Marisha: If I did it with Kash, would that--
Will: I'm with Zahra now, so let's try to keep that in mind.
Taliesin: Wow, two for two tonight.
Marisha: I don't know how to respond to that.
Liam: Your sense of humor is your best quality.
Will: Isn't it?
Liam: Best.
Will: We'll get her. She'll be fine!
Matt: As you guys take a moment and realize the time, the involvement that would be here to do the spell, you glance about in the streets of Thar Amphala, and what straggling undead and/or cultists seem to have been either trying to scramble back up to the city or hadn't made their way down through or were here as sentinels are frantically trying to escape and being cut down and grabbed by the various eagle riders and the rest of the army that's currently now beginning to swarm in, thanks to the complete falling of the barrier with the sealing of Vecna. You do feel at this moment that you do have some time in Thar Amphala without any immediate danger.
Will: But if it gets to that, I can stay and raise her, and you guys can go and take care of the city.
Laura: Thank you.
Marisha: I don't even know if I have a full hour left on my form. That's the only problem. That's why I would need help, but--
Will: She needs to rest, anyway.
Mary: I can stay. I'll stay with him.
Laura: Thank you.
Mary: We'll focus on her.
Sam: We'll all stay, until we don't have to.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: I help Kash as much as I can.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I sit down and hold her hand.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Start cleaning her cheeks as well as we can.
Marisha: And I don't take my eyes off of Vax the whole time.
Sam: Oh, yeah. Shit.
Will: I'm holding my medal. Starting the spell.
Matt: As you guys form a perimeter here at the base of Entropis, the sky now open, the clouds dispelled and scattered, and probably for the first time in weeks, especially from your guys' perspective, Vasselheim sees a sky of blue. The sunlight rains down from above, and the warmth that comes through is very comforting as you begin to clear the space and scrawl out the sigils and glyphs necessary for this Raise Dead ritual. As you're going through the process and you quietly begin to focus, you can see some of the eagle riders and straggling wyvern riders take notice and begin to come close, and then stop and keep a distance, and recognizing the significance of this moment, respectfully stay away.
Will: As he's casting the glyphs, he goes over, he's about to write the last one, and he walks over to Vex, and he takes one tear, and he goes back over and uses it to do the last glyph.
Matt: As he draws the last glyph with the tear, that one seems to have an additional flair, a connection, a sparkle of bloodline connectivity between you and the deceased. As you complete the spell, I need you to go ahead and bring to this ritual what you'd like.
Sam: Oh god.
Laura: Jesus, really? Oh, god. I take one of my arrows that has the owlbear feather on it, and I put it down next to her because I know she loved owlbears.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me. Okay. Anybody else?
Liam: I pull Simon from around my waist, and I start to fasten it around her. This is yours. You're going to have to take care of him now. His name is Simon. Most people don't think he's alive, but they're wrong. He's very much alive. Take care of him for me. I didn't get nearly enough time with you. I'm sorry. I love you very much. I kiss her on the forehead.
Matt: Roll another d20.
Liam: I rolled an 18, but I'm going to use Luck. Good. 18 is good.
Matt: Okay.
Mary: I take the moonstone from my staff, and I clasp it in my hands, and I say: Sirius, you asked me to be here and to judge them. They are worthy. Give me this boon. Help me save this girl, for true friendship, which I never had until now. Help me save her. Help us all save her. And I place the moonstone down next to her head.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.
Mary: I'll use Luck.
Matt: If you want to.
Mary: 12.
Matt: Okay. As you complete the ritual, all the sigils in place lighting up, it's unique because you're used to the ritual completed by an acolyte of Sarenrae, in which everything has a glow of warmth to it. This ritual was completed by an acolyte of an entity named Vesh, and as each sigil flares, you watch as they darken into the deepest shadow. It's a yin-yang dichotomy as the spell begins to take effect, until eventually the whole circle becomes pitch black, like the deepest of lightless midnight. At that moment, you watch as Velora's form itself is also cast into shadow and disappears from view. And for a moment, you fear she is gone, before the shadow begins to peel away like a cocoon, and as it tears and rolls back, the subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling, you watch as her chest begins to move once more, breathing, her eyes still closed, but life breathes into her lungs once more. With a natural 19.
Laura: I hug her. Oh, and I pop Trinket out of his necklace, and I cast Cure Wounds on him so he can lick her face.
Matt: Okay. As Trinket comes out, Trinket is burned and battered, armor dinged up and screwed up, on his face it's askew to one side--
Travis: He got meteored. (laughter)
Matt: Yeah, he did.
Travis: I didn't sign up for this shit.
Laura: I've still got a 3rd-level Cure Wounds on him.
Matt: All right.
Mary: I cast Beast Speak. You all right, Trinket?
Matt: "I don't care." And Trinket comes forward to Velora and begins licking her face, and she who is breathing but unconscious, the eye begins to slowly open. "What?" And her eyes open up a little bit, and you can see her skin darkened from the blast and the rubble and the dust that's now begun to settle around the base of Entropis, and she looks up and first sees the lapping tongue of Trinket against her cheek, and giggles and pushes him away a little bit. Then she sees the feather and looks at it and now looks up to see the person that's holding her and looks and meets both of your gazes--
Laura: Hi, little monkey.
Matt: "Hi."
Liam: You're an awfully long way from home.
Matt: "What happened?"
Laura: You went on an adventure, that's all.
Matt: She gets quiet for a second, trying to remember, trying to recall. "I'm very tired."
Laura: Of course.
Matt: And she curls up and pulls tighter around Vex's neck.
Will: Kash steps in. You don't feel evil, do you? (laughter)
Matt: She pulls back and looks over at you. "Who's this human?"
Laura: Oh, he saved your life just now, dear.
Liam: He's a friend. Come here.
Will: All right.
Laura: No, but seriously, could she be evil? Seriously.
Will: No, there's-- no. You feel okay?
Matt: She arranges the situation and looks back at you and goes, (giggles).
Will: She's fine. I'd watch her.
Laura: Yeah. She's fine. (laughter)
Matt: She pulls back into you and whispers in your ear and says, "He's pretty stupid, isn't he?"
Laura: He's really stupid.
Matt: She giggles and then sighs into you.
Laura: Okay, yeah. Just rest. I'm going to sit her on top of Trinket so she can take a little nappy-nap.
Matt: Okay. And she passes right out. She is spent. She is exhausted.
Will: The city is still burning.
Mary: Yes, it is. We have work to do.
Will: We've got a lot of people down there we know.
Mary: I know. The Slayer's Take is in desperate need. We should check on the sphinx.
Travis: The sphinx, right.
Laura: We can't thank you enough. Again.
Will: You guys always do throw the best parties, that's for sure.
Mary: Yes, you do.
Laura: I'm so glad you're all right.
Will: Yeah, I'm glad we could help. That's why we're going to name our child Vax. I'm totally kidding; that's never going to happen. (laughter)
Mary: Take the moonstone. Keep it with you. If you need me-- well, I won't come, because I'll be away, but--
Laura: Yeah, you'll be a little busy with the child and all.
Mary: A little busy, yes. But come and visit if you get a chance. Who knows? Twins runs in my family, so you never know.
Laura: Really?
Mary: Yes. Lillith told me. I need to see Lillith again.
Liam: Oh, the joke's on you.
Laura: I give her a big hug.
Mary: I love you, darling.
Laura: I love you so much. Congratulations.
Mary: Thank you, dearest. Scanlan.
Sam: Yes?
Mary: You little bastard.
Sam: Yes? That is my full name, yes. (laughter)
Mary: I plant a giant, fiery kiss on him, and my tail wraps around his head.
Sam: I try to get away, but--
Mary: The tail. (laughter)
Will: I told you.
Sam: You're right! Kinky. Ooh! What? I mean, thank you?
Mary: I miss doing your hair.
Sam: Well, I miss doing, well--
Mary: We'll see each other, again, I hope. Grog.
Travis: Yeah?
Mary: Use that moonhammer.
Travis: I will-- I mean, again.
Laura: At night. In the night.
Mary: Use it in the moon--
Travis: Yeah. Under the moon.
Laura: Yeah, obviously.
Travis: It's called a moonhammer. Yeah.
Mary: Use it in the moonlight. I think you'll be surprised.
Travis: In the nude.
Taliesin: Without pants.
Mary: Without pants.
Travis: Right. Yeah. Moon for moon, as above, so below--
Mary: Yes.
Travis: And that will unleash--
Mary: Take your pants off, here we go.
Liam: Double damage on cows. Yeah.
Travis: I'm going to fuck some cows up.
Mary: Yeah, you do.
Will: Oh, Grog. I love standing next to you in battle and hate standing next to you at the urinal. (laughter)
Will: That's just the way it is, my friend. Been a pleasure.
Mary: Percy.
Taliesin: Yes?
Mary: Take care of our girl.
Taliesin: I'll try.
Mary: Take care of her.
Taliesin: My regards to your family.
Mary: Thank you, love. We'll be in Whitestone again soon. I'll see you soon, dearest.
Sam: Don't see us too soon. I mean, whenever you're near us, you both almost die. So maybe just--
Laura: Give it some time.
Will: But we--
Will: Almost.
Mary: Almost.
Mary: That's the key word is almost, you see. Yes. You saved our lives. We can never repay you.
Travis: I believe you saved ours first by showing up.
Marisha: We saved each other. That's kind of what Vox Machina's all about.
Liam: This is the second time around you.
Mary: That's what we do for each other. I love you, Vax.
Liam: I love you, too, Mary.
Mary: Oh, baby, don't do that.
Matt: At this point, you begin to hear distant horns echoing throughout the city streets. Distant, emanating throughout. As you glance over, you haven't heard these horns before. But they sound less like horns of warning and more like horns of victory. Glancing down in the streets, there are still flames and columns of smoke and you can still see scuffles beneath. The siege weaponry attacks against the titan have subsided and it has not moved at all. It is locked in place, a large statuesque-like mountain of an ancient entity now lording over the edge of the Braving Grounds, almost creeping upon the outskirts of the Quad Roads towards the center of the city, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. Most of the Braving Grounds is in tatters but--
Laura: I look at Percy. This would be a wonderful place for a summer home. (chuckles)
Will: We've got to go.
Mary: We've got to go.
Sam: What? No.
Mary: We have to leave.
Will: They need us back.
Mary: Yeah.
Liam: Don't be strangers, though.
Mary: We won't.
Liam: Look in.
Laura: Thank you, guys.
Mary: We will.
Liam: Look in if you can.
Mary: We love you all so much.
Travis: Thank you.
Taliesin: Thank you, as well.
Will: So this is what it's like to have a family, huh?
Mary: Yeah.
Will: I can get used to that.
Marisha: Sounds like you're going to have an actual family soon.
Sam: Well I shit more than your kid will, but other than that, it's like this but with less shit.
Will: Then we'll be happy.
Mary: Always.
Will: Call us if you need us. Anytime.
Laura: Same.
Mary: We'll be here.
Laura: All right.
Mary: Thank you.
Will: Luck in battle.
Sam: Thank you.
Laura: Bye loves.
Liam: See you later, smart ass.
Mary: Thank you.
Will: Bastard. Treat her well or I'm going to come back.
Laura: Hey, you've got your hands full, all right?
Will: That's true, too.
Matt: And as she completes a secondary Fly spell, these two coast off over the edge of Thar Amphala, down into the center of Vasselheim on their own. At which point, you notice three battle-disheveled wyvern riders that were waiting at the side begin to approach. One of them you recognize as a captain signified by these ivory horns that curl out of the back of the helmet and grow longer than the regular wyvern riders' armor you've encountered. Having stepped off the armored drake that currently waits, shaking its head, large leathery wings dug into the nearby rubble, the warrior approaches, pulling the helmet off, revealing a tumble of braided amber hair with shaved sides and a rather stern-looking woman that you don't recognise. "Vox Machina! I am Captain Obelin. I would ask, does this shift in tide signify anything? Does the lich still loom about?"
Laura: He fucking dead.
Taliesin: Does not. The battle is won.
Laura: He's been sealed away.
Matt: "It is done?"
Travis: It is.
Taliesin: "Fucking dead." (laughter)
Travis: Lady Vex'ahlia.
Taliesin: Lady, yes.
Matt: "The gods grant their grace upon Vasselheim still. We thank you. Well, there's little time to celebrate. There's still much to be done, but please bring this information to the Platinum Sanctuary, to somewhere of significance in the city. This information needs to go out. this will greatly bolster the ranks, morale of those--"
Marisha: Start spreading the word yourself. You can help us out, right?
Matt: "Oh, we shall." She looks over her shoulder at the other soldiers.
Taliesin: I've got the last flare from Whitestone from all those years ago.
Laura: I have a purple flare too. We should all set them off.
Marisha: I was going to say  I think I still have a Skywrite.
Sam: Let's do it.
Marisha: Yep.
Laura: I send up my purple flare, too.
Sam: I pull out my gun. (laughter)
Travis: Yes!
Marisha: Oh my god!
Travis: I forgot you have one.
Liam: What a callback.
Taliesin: I've been waiting for it.
Travis: Please misfire. Please blow your hand off.
Sam: Let's do this. (yells) (laughter)
Matt: Okay. Roll a d20.
Travis: Please.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: Natural 20.
Taliesin: No!
Sam: (machine gun noises)
Liam: Say hello to my even littler friend!
Travis: Oh my god.
Matt: So as you guys send up your colored Whitestone crest flares into the sky, what do you Skywrite?
Marisha: Vecna defeated.
Laura: That's a lot of writing.
Taliesin: That's a lot of words.
Matt: The wisps of cloud begin to spell across--
Sam: V def.
Marisha: (laughs) I can write it out.
Taliesin: You can.
Matt: Yeah. As it coasts across, you hear this loud echoing (gunshot) as the N in the middle of Vecna seems to dissipate with a little puff as a perfectly aimed bullet from one pistol that does not backfire, because that would have been fucking funny.
Taliesin: It's all I wanted tonight.
Travis: So good.
Matt: Roll a performance check.
Sam: Performance? Come on. 28.
Matt: 28. For a man who has only shot a pistol once, he Revolver Ocelots that shit.
Laura: He's been practicing that shit in his bedroom.
Marisha: Yeah. In the mirror.
Travis: Behind the back. Oh shit. (laughter)
Sam: I've been watching you.
Travis: Percy's like, "I don't do that shit." (laughter)
Taliesin: Yeah, no.
Matt: These flares bursting and slowly descending, coming down and bringing this-- it was a purple flare and what was the color of yours?
Taliesin: Gold, if I recall.
Matt: So gold and purple begin to burn down below, giving this strange atmospheric light to the outside of the large, still titan form as the words across the sky, you begin to hear this low gathering of cheers. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of voices where you once heard screaming and yelling now join in unison. A rallying cry of victory that crawls across the entirety of Vasselheim around you on all sides. What do you guys want to do?
Travis: I need that hand.
Sam: Do we have Locate Object or something?
Liam: I do.
Laura: I mean, yeah.
Sam: Is it an object? I guess it's inanimate now.
Matt: It is considered an object now.
Liam: I do.
Laura: That's good.
Liam: I got it. I've seen it. I have the spell slot.
Matt: All right. So you cast Locate Object and you have a very strong vision of the direction and it's maybe a hundred feet to your left, and it is under quite a bit of rubble.
Liam: Big man, come on. I'm going to need you to dig; it's over here.
Travis: Not a problem.
Matt: All right.
Sam: Rage dig.
Matt: Giving him direction. Rage-digging through, tossing veritable small boulders with one-handed scoops. You guys are having to dodge out of the way as they go flying by and skidding to a halt maybe 50, 60 feet behind him. Go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage, because of his aid.
Travis: That's about as good as it gets, because that's even worse. 16.
Matt: 16. Okay.
Travis: With a minus two.
Matt: It takes you a little while, but thanks to Locate Object, you cruise through and you eventually find-- It's been smashed, but it's still intact and there you see the completely cut off, red-scaled, clawed hand of Arkhan the Cruel.
Travis: He fucked us.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: He helped us. And then he fucked us. Yeah.
Marisha: I guess the help was worth the fucking, but only a little bit.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: The voice creeps into your head. "Take it. Find him. He has to die."
Travis: Feel like I should take this and try and find him. He's got to fucking die.
Laura: Yeah, he probably does.
Travis: He was so cool and strong and only his physique rivals my own, but I feel like he's got to die.
Liam: Please. He couldn't touch you, are you kidding?
Marisha: You know, you're not having--
Travis: Couldn't.
Laura: You seem to like him a lot. Are you sure you want to kill him and not just try to get--
Marisha: Grog.
Travis: What? Hold on.
Marisha: We all think you're strong. You don't need to have an inferiority complex.
Travis: A what?
Laura: Yeah, I don't think he's going to understand.
Liam: I don't think he has those.
Travis: So he's a paladin of--
Sam: Tiamat.
Travis: Right. Is that a good or a bad?
Sam: Bad, I'm guessing?
Matt: Make a religion check with advantage because you still have-- well, the blessing would have worn off.
Liam: That thing could rot. Do you know what preserves a hand?
Laura: The bag of colding.
Sam: More than 20.
Matt: Yeah, Tiamat's very bad. Known as the Scaled Tyrant, she resides in the Nine Hells and is the patron deity of all chromatic dragons.
Sam: Oh, yeah. She's the dragon god. She?
Matt: She. The opposite of Bahamut.
Travis: Of good dragons, or bad?
Sam: Bad dragons.
Travis: Okay. I feel like he had a good insight, but the hand does bad things, right?
Laura: The hand does really bad things. You know what you should do is bring that to Bahamut.
Liam: Yeah, after you piss on it.
Marisha: Why are you so connected to the pissing thing?
Laura: Don't piss on it, Grog.
Travis: But he said preserve it.
Laura: But then maybe if they try to use the hand to find it, it might lead them to you instead because you've already pissed on it.
Travis: Lead them to my junk?
Laura: Potentially.
Travis: People have come looking for it for less.
Laura: You don't want people chopping off your junk thinking your junk is Vecna's hand, do you?
Travis: It doesn't even look like a hand. Just like one really big middle finger. (laughter)
Liam: It's like a mole, right?
Travis: Yeah. All right, I have it. I'm not going to preserve it.
Laura: Put it in the bag of colding.
Liam: Such a mistake.
Sam: That's on the to-do list. We'll go find him.
Laura: All right.
Travis: And Bahamut is the platinum--
Laura: Tiamat's the bad guy.
Travis: No, Bahamut is the good dragon of the platinum variety?
All: Yes.
Travis: Would you say they are at odds?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: Yes.
Liam: Safe bet.
Travis: Like Godzilla and King Kong?
Liam: I don't know those references, but yeah, they are at odds.
Marisha: What's-her-name worshipped Bahamut.
Laura: Kima.
Marisha: Was it Kima? Kima! Kima worships Bahamut.
Travis: She was badass.
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Yes.
Travis: I'll just hold on to the hand right now.
Laura: What's going on there, Grog?
Travis: Nothing. We just had a big fight.
Taliesin: You're making that monologue face. Like that face someone makes when they're listening to some very complex internal monologue. You don't make that face very often. You're making it right now. Just start speaking whatever's in your head right now. Free-form.
Travis: I have to go after the hand, I must kill Vecna, I have to do these things.
Taliesin: Okay, this is starting to paint a picture. You feel better now?
Travis: Nuh-huh.
Taliesin: Okay.
Marisha: Is that going on all the time in your head?
Travis: No.
Marisha: Okay.
Taliesin: Are you lying right now?
Sam: He nodded when he said no.
Liam: DM, just for funsies, do I sense Vecna in any way, shape, or form?
Matt: No.
Liam: Okay. Definitely want to piss on that hand, Grog.
Laura: Don't piss on the hand. Number one  it's already in the bag of colding and I don't want everything else pissed on.
Liam: Grog and I don't share much!
Taliesin: Except pissing? (laughter)
Taliesin: It was an honest question.
Travis: That's true.
Laura: What should we do, you guys?
Taliesin: I'm so tired.
Marisha: I grab onto Vax and don't let go.
Sam: We have more pressing concerns.
Taliesin: That does remind me. Scanlan?
Sam: What?
Taliesin: You're going to have to give it back now.
Sam: Give what back?
Taliesin: You know exactly what.
Sam: The gun?
Taliesin: Yes.
Travis: That was part of a trade.
Sam: This is my gun.
Taliesin: I don't think it's your gun.
Sam: I found it.
Taliesin: You didn't.
Travis: No, there was a trade of items. I got a cloak of smashing out of it, and you got... other stuff.
Sam: I found it fair and square; it's my gun.
Taliesin: There's no fair and square. And honestly, if you were anybody else, I would find it when I was rummaging through your corpse later. But it's you. So instead I just use my words, and I'm trying to be a better person. If you really like it, maybe we'll have a special one made that's a little safer. But not that one. That's one of mine.
Sam: I look so cool.
Taliesin: I'll make you something fancy that's a little less prone to explode.
Liam: Scanlan, you should know you always look cool. Always.
Taliesin: Especially with the head thing. It's quite nice.
Marisha: Yeah, this is awesome. Does he still have the blessing?
Matt: The blessing has faded by now.
Taliesin: You should get that tattooed in permanently.
Marisha: Yeah.
Sam: That's a good idea.
Taliesin: That's a really good idea.
Marisha: I can draw on you with the remaining remnants. That way you have it there, always.
Sam: I love it.
Marisha: Okay. I try to draw the outline of the remaining glyph on his head.
Matt: So you take some ash and charcoal from the nearby rubble and loosely draw the symbol on his forehead. Roll a dexterity check.
Marisha: Okay. Straight dex? Don't fuck me, Gil! 14.
Matt: 14. It's passable.
Marisha: Yeah, that right there. That's perfect. Get that tattooed.
Sam: All right. It's going to happen. I feel like we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this.
Taliesin: On the forehead?
Laura: Definitely on the forehead.
Marisha: Definitely on the forehead.
Liam: Well, maybe in different places. We don't all need to get it in the same place. Maybe on a theme, but not the exact same thing?
Laura: We already all got tattoos, didn't we?
Taliesin: Well, we got tattoos. That's all that matters.
Travis: No, we didn't.
Marisha: I'm not sure what we're talking about anymore.
Laura: No, I thought we got them in character.
Marisha: No, he got them.
Liam: I got one. And I got one.
Laura: Oh, we got the Slayer's Take.
Marisha: Wait, we're branded, and then I've got mine, and then he has his.
Liam: I have the burnt hand on my back. Elven. No, it's not mostly healed. Scanlan Shorthalt! You don't need a gun to look cool. You are the Meat Man. You are Burt Reynolds. You are a fucking hero.
Sam: I'm going to throw it away. Wrist Pocket! (laughter)
Matt: Make a sleight of hand check.
Sam: Nine. 12.
Matt: 12?
Marisha: Bullshit! My passive perception is 21.
Matt: Yeah, you guys totally see him. It's the worst example--
Liam: That's the trick I do for my eight-year-old!
Taliesin: Look at it go! Wow! (laughter)
Travis: You caught it?! You threw it--
Sam: Around the world.
Travis: Oh my god! (laughter)
Travis: I faint. (laughter)
Laura: Hey, while he's out, should we get this sword off him?
Liam: Why?
Laura: Because it seems like he's a little weird from it. Nobody else feels that way?
Taliesin: I think so.
Travis: (gasps) You're so strong. What'd I miss?
Laura: Nothing.
Marisha: We were talking about you. I mean, we were talking about-- sorry, I'm still working on it.
Laura: Yeah, no, it's getting better. Should we get off of the titan, maybe?
Sam: It could fall.
Taliesin: Does anyone want to start walking towards the city to see how bad it really is?
Laura: We'll have to get through the titan, or we can fly down. Outside of that, I don't know.
Sam: How many of us can fly? Well, I guess we could take a couple of trips on the carpet.
Taliesin: We've got a carpet. Some of us have wings.
Liam: My wings are gone.
Marisha: My wings are gone.
Matt: Yeah, your wings are gone. Pike's wings are gone. You guys have your broom; you have the carpet.
Sam: So we can take three trips on the carpet, or something?
Taliesin: We can ride on the broom.
Marisha: Have we taken a short rest, at this point?
Matt: Yeah, you guys would have taken a short rest, at this point.
Marisha: My beast shape's back.
Matt: I'll say for the purposes of when you were helping with the ritual that he was casting, because that's an hour long, that would have been a short rest, easy.
Liam: What are you going to be?
Marisha: Well, what do you want to fly in on? What do you want?
Liam: Dragon?
Marisha: I can't do that. I can do anything in the animal kingdom.
Travis: Before we go down, before we leave, what about Sylas?
Laura: (gasps) Sylas.
Marisha: He flew away.
Laura: Right, but he's repairing somewhere.
Travis: They have coffins, right?
Liam: We deduced that it doesn't take him that long to come back together. And it's been--
Matt: Not terribly long.
Liam: But we're right at that cutoff point.
Matt: Maybe.
Taliesin: Try to scry on him! He's probably having a bad day. There's enough time.
Marisha: I'll scry on him.
Taliesin: There's a gold dragon that should be--
Marisha: Oh, I haven't used any of my 5th-level spells!
Laura: Do you have Daylight, still? Something with sun? I guess sunlight would take him out, because it's during the day.
Marisha: Yeah. I still have 3rd-level spells. Yep. I also have my 6th-level spells. I have Sunbeam learned, which is dope.
Liam: That's all you need.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to scry on him.
Taliesin: Grog, do you want to trade boots, by the way, again?
Matt: Okay, and he's used all of his resistances.
Taliesin: We don't have to, if you really like them.
Marisha: He's used all of his legendary resistances? Is that what that was?
Matt: Yeah. That is a natural 19 plus seven wisdom save. So that's a 26.
Marisha: Oh my god!
Sam: He beat your scry?
Marisha: He rolled a natural 19?
Matt: Natural 19.
Laura: You can't do it?
Marisha: I can do it again. Can I do it again?
Matt: If you have another spell slot for it.
Marisha: I do it again!
Matt: Natural 16 plus seven. So that's a 23.
Sam: That wins.
Laura: Can I try to cast Locate Object on the pants he was wearing?
Liam: That's amazing!
Laura: They're an object.
Taliesin: She has seen them.
Laura: I've seen them!
Taliesin: They're very nice.
Matt: Let me consult the verbiage of--
Liam: This is amazing, and I love you. That is amazing!
Taliesin: That is the greatest thing I've ever heard. Locate Pants. I would like to scry upon the pants. The pantalones.
Liam: On his loafers.
Matt: Okay. All right, cool. And you have a 2nd-level spell slot for this?
Laura: Yes.
Matt: So as you complete the spell and try to focus as hard as you can on the pants of Lord Sylas Briarwood--
Taliesin: He has pajamas he changes into.
Liam: They're Batman pajamas.
Matt: Nothing.
Laura: Nothing? He's definitely recovering naked. Fuck! Nothing.
Marisha: No pants?
Laura: No pants.
Liam: He's in the buck!
Marisha: You guys! He's shirt-cocking somewhere! (laughter)
Matt: He prepared! He knew! "It's the only way they won't find me!" He pulls his tearaways off and chucks them.
Travis: Just goes up and says hi to people.
Marisha: Flashing innocents through all the city!
Matt: It's his dominate action.
Travis: Yeah, right!
Laura: We're going to have to worry about him at some point.
Sam: Not now.
Marisha: I can try and scrying eye him. I also still have one more 5th-level spell.
Laura: Yeah, but how are we going to take him out if you use all your spells to find him?
Marisha: I have a 6th.
Travis: Maybe we let him go.
Liam: She's saying you got one more shot, and we still have some sunlight.
Laura: One more time.
Marisha: One more time.
Matt: Well, you used the scrying eye before you took the long rest in the Feywild, or was it after?
Liam: That was for finding the Sword of Kas, wasn't it, before we slept?
Matt: Yeah, that would have been before. Yeah, okay. So you can use it.
Marisha: But I'm using my 5th-level spell first.
Matt: Okay, you are?
Marisha: Yeah, I'm using my 3rd.
Matt: That's a natural seven.
Sam: That could work.
Matt: As you close your eyes and focus, trying desperately to find the location of Sylas Briarwood, your vision pulls back and is thrust past the titan, and there's a flash of movement. You're suddenly seeing trees. You're sensing somewhere in the thick forest of the Vasper Timberlands. And there, you focus on rapidly flapping bat wings.
Marisha: Still trying to get back? He's still trying to get back!
Matt: You don't know. He's in the forest somewhere. He's in a deep forest with bits of snow around him. And you're only catching glimpses of it as he goes through the shadowed underbrush.
Marisha: No type of landmark?
Matt: Just trees, endless trees.
Laura: He's running away.
Taliesin: I would run if I were him.
Sam: Deal with him another day.
Marisha: He's in the Vasper forest.
Liam: Well, we'll never see him again.
Taliesin: He may finally have had enough.
Marisha: Do you ever think there's a chance for Lady Briarwood to come back?
Laura: I don't think so.
Travis: Never say never.
Liam: Never say never.
Taliesin: Never say never, but probably not.
Laura: I mean, if we can bring people back, they might be able to.
Travis: That's a good point.
Taliesin: He would have to work very hard to make it happen.
Travis: We're going to live a life of paranoia, aren't we?
Taliesin: Well, we knew that going in.
Sam: We'll be okay.
Laura: So do we go see the leaders here?
Sam: Yeah. Let's go.
Taliesin: Let's go see who's left.
Matt: All right.
Sam: To the platinum temple?
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, around the corner, you see there's a few of the eagle riders that are getting on their eagle back and flying off. There is one figure that stays behind and that turns around and begins to walk your direction. In the chaos, you hadn't noticed that when Vecna had been dispelled, the force cage that had maintained and locked in J'mon Sa Ord had vanished. You see them turn around and look towards you in humanoid form. They approach with the long, jet-black hair, the darkened skin, the beautiful coal-like ember eyes. Tall, almost as tall as Grog, though lithe in form and simply clothed. J'mon approaches. "Well, I'm certainly impressed. I apologize to have not been as much help as I had hoped."
Laura: That was a shitty spell he cast.
Matt: "It seems to be his forte. Nonetheless, the least I can do is offer you a way into the city."
Travis: That would be lovely.
Matt: "I would like to speak with the council that remains, as well. Come with me." J'mon turns around and steps about 20 feet away before the wings sprout out of their back and stretch to each side. You see the large brass dragon form expand, the claws (impact) onto the ground. As they turn their head back over their shoulder, the deep voice of the dragon form: "Hop on."
Laura: I'm going to hold on to Velora. And Trinket, I swear it's going to be the last time, buddy. I'm not going to keep making you go in this necklace much more.
Matt: (bear grunts) Licks the side of your cheek. And closes his eyes, waiting for it.
Laura: Ooh, I love him so much.
Matt: Into the necklace.
Liam: And as Vax and Keyleth get situated on J'mon's back, I whisper in her ears: I was going to say eagle. Giant eagle.
Marisha: Yeah. That's good to know.
Travis: I pick up Pike and put her on my shoulders. Get on the dragon.
Matt: Okay. Pike climbs up, now wingless. "Thank you." Grabs onto the belt you have across your chest.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So do you all climb up onto J'mon's back?
Sam: Absolutely.
Matt: All right. J'mon, in Devo'ssa form, then begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of the city. Eventually, the wings begin to flap, and with one giant thrust of wind, ascends. And once again, you feel the wind rocket through your hair, as was your entry towards the titan. You begin to crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim, the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of the city that you've essentially saved. And really, did so through a quick jaunt to the Feywild. The Braving Grounds still, while in severe disarray and flames still burn, most everything's under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant cultists, warriors, and undead have either been destroyed, captured, or run out of the city. As you pick up 40, 50 feet over the rooftops, you see as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed Bastions, as civilians of Vasselheim have picked up whatever arms were available, of soldiers in the streets, children holding the hands of their families, all glance up and point at the majestic brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40, 50 feet ahead, signifying once more a symbol of hope and victory. You hear the shouts behind you. As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps leading up towards the platinum sanctuary. As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps are littered with broken bone, splatters of blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict is over here and has been for some time. The stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform itself before you approach the entryway in the pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa lands right at the top of the stair as all the soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off. As you do, you watch as the chatter, the conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the soldiers, even those who have seen better days, stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow of the head or kneel to you as you approach and pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors open already, and glance over your shoulder to see that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now walking at your side. Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are rushing around a bit, and they notice your arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure that everything is accounted for, and there's a bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon, who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches quickly. "Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well. You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine. I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best that-- come with me." And darts back towards the central meeting chambers of the Platinum Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that surround the wide marbled floors of the center chamber where all these council meetings have previously taken place. You can see battle has taken place here. While most of the bodies or the wounded or dead have been removed at this point, you can see there are elements of chipped and broken stone and marble. You can see scattered remains and blood stains at points towards the entryway. But most of it appears to have been halted at the entryway. All of the combat has halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you can see most of the council you met last is not here. They're probably handling their various portions of the city. But you do see amongst a number of inner guardians of the sanctuary Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side. Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she can give you a hug, she sees the child in your arms.
Laura: She's all right.
Matt: "I'm so glad."
Marisha: Yeah, group hug!
Matt: She pulls you in, and you all bundle into this big group hug, heaving breaths of relief cascade through your grouping. You hear the throat clear behind as Vord goes, (clears throat).
Travis: Decorum.
Laura: How's Kima?
Matt: "I assume she's well. She's been doing what she does best, which is wander the streets, destroying things that she doesn't like. I've been keeping a close eye from a distance as best I can. She seems all right."
Taliesin: Any word from Gilmore in the last hour?
Matt: "No, why?"
Marisha: He was in the tower. He was a decoy; we almost slayed him.
Laura: He'd been taken.
Liam: He's all right.
Taliesin: He's all right.
Sam: Do we know where he teleported off to?
Marisha: We sent him off with Cassandra.
Taliesin: Into the woods.
Laura: Into the wood.
Sam: Don't worry, it's a big woods. It'll be okay.
Liam: This city still stands. You have carried out a miracle.
Matt: "I've done nothing. Word seems to--" And at that point, she gets cut off by Highbearer Vord, who steps forward, his arms crossed. "Word seems to have spread, and I wish not to celebrate prematurely. I have reports that you were there, that you did battle with this ancient beast. What is your assurance? What is your confidence that this is indeed over, and we're not lulled into a false sense of security?"
Travis: We're pretty sure he's alive and well. You know, he's a threat right now. (whispering) What, do we have proof?
Laura: Oh, proof.
Taliesin: I've never known a true sense of security. I'm not entirely sure.
Sam: The proof is we're here and we're alive.
Laura: And that titan has stopped moving.
Liam: I am the champion of the Raven Queen. And she has allowed me to track his every movement for a while now.
Matt: "I recall you mentioning that when we last met."
Liam: He's gone.
Travis: There was a process. We had trammels.
Laura: You remembered the word.
Travis: Yes.
Marisha: Do I still have the remains of the broken trammel or did it shatter?
Matt: No, that shit shattered. It turned to dust.
Laura: Yeah, glitter bomb. Oh, glitter-bomb Vecna! I like the idea that he got glitter-bombed.
Matt: "That was my good eye!" (laughter)
Matt: All right. You see, as you guys are discussing, the Highbearer's eyes lock to Vax's, and you see softness return to his face. The tension, the unknowing, begins to subside with a smile, comes across his stilted, older elvish visage. "You all. There was a time I did not look past your beginnings. I am ashamed at my misjudgment." He looks around as folks begin to gather. He acknowledges J'mon, who's approached. They've bowed, carefully. "Many heroes rose to challenge this day. Many we've lost. And many others that remain to remember them. Let us vow to never forget those who gave everything so that we could still stand here to remember. You, Vox Machina, stand as that beacon of hope upon which we all we hold. You may not fully understand the scope of what you have done but I assure you, we do. And we will. We humble of Vasselheim are eternally in your debt. As is much of the ignorant world, perhaps. On behalf of Silver Talon's Reach, I thank you for everything." The rest of the room who's begun to gather now, you see other soldiers that were waiting outside as you first approached have begun to filter in. And as you glance back towards the entry hallway of the Platinum Sanctuary, you see faces. People that greeted you in. People hearing these words resounding in silence, and they all begin to bow low.
Laura: This is weird.
Sam: Should we say something?
Travis: Ask for money?
Laura: They haven't done our fees, right?
Marisha: I'm supremely uncomfortable.
Sam: You are the leader of your people. Maybe you should say something.
Marisha: What?
Sam: You're a leader!
Marisha: No! But I'm not a leader of these people.
Laura: You've been giving us really good inspirational speeches. Get up and say something.
Taliesin: Get up and say something.
Laura: Say something really awesome.
Taliesin: Just tell people it was brilliant and great.
Marisha: Okay. I step forward.
Matt: So as you stand here amongst this procession of warriors, people that now look up and don't see Keyleth the druid, they see the Voice of the Tempest. They see one of the as-to-probably-be-remembered saviors of the city and beyond. All eyes are on you as Highbearer Vord steps away.
Liam: I'm still holding your hand.
Marisha: (chuckles, sighs) The bravery of Vasselheim remains evident on this day, and you all should be proud that your reputation of a city unfallen by invasion or attack remains, and that is only because of the faith and the bravery and the strength of the citizens of this amazing city. We of Vox Machina are proud and honored to have fought by every single one of you, and we vow to continue to stand by your side through the rest of our days. Huzzah!
All: Huzzah! (cheering)
Ashley: Hey, can you hear me?
Matt: With a wave of cheers that roar from within these marbled halls that echo, boom and reverberate--
Marisha: To 1,000 years of Vasselheim! Huzzah!
Matt: Cheers and cries and fists raise and Pike's cheering--
Ashley: Yay! (laughter)
Matt: You see Velora pull away from Allura's arm, who's come by to help you carry her, and she: (weakly) "Yay." And Allura looks to you with an absolute look of respect and pride. Even the Highbearer seems to be taken by the words. Shit, everyone in the room gets temporary hit points, practically.
Marisha: Yeah! 20 hit points now.
Matt: The sun-glass roof, which currently has been sitting within the shadow of the mountain, the sunlight begins to peak past and glide its way across the marble floor as everyone's cheering and the room now, which once was in shadow of the mountain, is now lit up with sunlight. Now you can see the glittering armor that peeks through the dirt, the grime, the blood, shining and sparkling on each of you, across Pike's beautiful armor, across all the warriors that stand here, across the Scalebearer's design, across your hair. The room is filled with light and though you sense the presence of probably Bahamut, glancing down you can't help but think that this is also the approving glance of Pelor, perhaps a bit of the Everlight. As the cheers begin to fade, the crowd begins to pull away. Conversations progress, thank-yous are given, people come up to you. And eventually you guys begin to step out of the Sanctuary and there you look down across the upper platform, looking down over the city. You can see the Birthheart, the Duskmeadow, pillars of smoke rising up as the sun now hangs high in the sky. A cold sensation takes you in the chest, Vax. A small pain. A second one. And your eyes shoot over across to the Raven's Crest, damaged but still standing. You turn around to look at the rest of your family and as you guys look at his face, in but a flash you can see this dark shape behind him. This looming black cloak, this lithe dress that cascades down into a bell and drags across the ground. And there you see the form of the Raven Queen, porcelain mask, long dark hair behind, as her hands slowly creep over the shoulders of Vax'ildan.
Taliesin: I walk to step in between.
Matt: In between the two of them?
Taliesin: Yes.
Matt: While the lips do not move on this mask, the voice in your head says, "You've done well, but do not approach. This is not for you."
Marisha: No.
Taliesin: Do you recall what you told me once?
Matt: No response. Do you continue to walk?
Taliesin: I do.
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Liam: Percy.
Taliesin: No. No, that's-- actually, you know what? Hey, that's right. I'm going to Resolve that.
Liam: Freddie.
Taliesin: This is not about you. That's a 19, 22.
Matt: That does not do it.
Taliesin: Damn it. I have a 19.
Matt: I know. Muscles lock into place and you find yourself held there on your third step. The voice, which is omnipresent in your mind, all about, continues. Soothing. Cold, distant but still soothing. The mask slowly looks down towards you. "You have done well, my champion. The skein of destiny has tugged in your wake, and even this victory culminates with the crossing of a few fate-touched souls. By your hand, your bravery, your sacrifice, you ensure a future for all you love and all who will come to love you and what you've done. You may never know the import of your time here, but take solace in the knowledge that you will see the ripples of your actions carry hope for generations to come. My Vax'ildan. It is time. Say your goodbyes, then come join my side." And the hands pull away. She stands there.
Sam: Now? We don't even get a night together or anything?
Marisha: It's not fair.
Laura: We've got a really long time to be alive. You've got an infinite time. What's a few more years?
Marisha: He sacrificed himself in your name; you remain the only ascended. And yet he still loses?
Matt: "He does not lose. The gifts I gave, indeed all of your patrons gave, were so that you," and you watch as her hands extend almost impossibly long around her, "and everyone here still stands. I understand selfishness. I understand the impulse of mortality. But I would hope that you understand that the actions that you've allowed Vax'ildan in this sacrifice are far larger. But we made a deal. With power comes a price."
Marisha: I'm not ready.
Liam: You're ready for your people.
Marisha: Not without you.
Liam: I am so very proud of you, and so grateful for everything you gave to me. You are going to be a strong leader and a wise leader.
Marisha: I'll find you. I promise. I'll see you again.
Liam: I'll never be that far away.
Marisha: Forever.
Liam: And ever and always. Boys. My brothers... I love you.
Sam: We love you, too. Thank you for everything. If you want us to fight her, just say jenga, and we will.
Liam: Maybe from the other side. Someday, just for shits and giggles.
Travis: Can I ask, are you afraid?
Liam: I'm going to go visit my mother, and I'll see all of you again. Freddie.
Taliesin: I do not accept this.
Liam: I know. But I charge you to take good care of my sister and love her. And your friend Keyleth, love her, as well. She will need it. She will need friends.
Taliesin: Of course.
Liam: Thank you for trying.
Sam: I wish I could have done more.
Liam: You did everything. Pickle? Pickle, you showed me the way. I know it doesn't look like that right now, but you absolutely did.
Ashley: I wish I could restore you.
Liam: (chuckles) You taught me purpose, Pickle. Purpose. And I know I will see you again.
Ashley: Isn't there--
Sam: She said is there something we can do? It's hard to hear her.
Liam: Be there for them. You be there for them. You're the light in all our lives.
Laura: No.
Liam: I never had a greater friend than you. And we traveled a lot, I never had a greater friend than you.
Laura: I feel like she's taking part of me away.
Liam: I will bring it with me to remind me of you.
Laura: I don't know how to live.
Liam: I will see you again.
Laura: I know.
Liam: I will see you again. And I will tell your mother that you say hello.
Laura: Please. I love you. I don't accept this.
Liam: I know that it's hard. And I am sorry.
Laura: I'm going to find you.
Liam: I take Keyleth's face in my hands and happily take one more kiss. I'm sorry it's so cold.
Marisha: I don't care. I don't accept this. I love you.
Liam: I will never stop loving you.
Marisha: This isn't fair.
Liam: I know.
Marisha: I guess we have to say goodbye.
Liam: For now. I love you, Keyleth of the Air Ashari.
Marisha: I love you, Vax'ildan. I'll see you again.
Liam: I look to the Raven Queen and as I walk closer, since I leveled up, I use the druid cantrip Druidcraft and grow snowdrops out from where I stand, out to all of my family. Out to where they stand. S.H.I.T.s, thank you. How lucky I have been to have had all of you. How lucky, indeed. Thank you.
Matt: And he turns and walks towards the darkened cloak of his matron. In the darkness of her cloak, you see a brief light, and it's brighter for you. As you walk forward, you see reaching from the light the dark hair, the fair skin, and the wide smile of your mother, Elaina. As she greets you, she says, "I'm so proud." The rest of you watch as her cloak begins to fade like a slowly scattered shadow in creeping sunlight. And as the snowdrop flowers continue with each step, you blink, and it's just feathers. We're going to take a break, we'll be back here in a few minutes, guys. (heavy exhale) Still more of this story to tell. See you guys in a bit. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome back. So before we jump back in, our winner in the chat of the giveaway is Mister Milgram. Congratulations. Danoba will reach out to you and get your contact information and get your prize sent off to you, so well done. All right, so. Bringing us back in.
Taliesin: No.
Sam: Something feels different about the table.
Matt: Yeah. As the cold wind subsides and the feathers glide through the wind off the edge of the Silver Talon's Reach, pinnacle of Platinum Sanctuary, you gather your thoughts. Quiet creeps over.
Sam: I feel like I could have taken her if I had a gun. I'm just saying.
Marisha: Scanlan, have we ever told you you're an asshole?
Sam: All the time.
Taliesin: I use Manners on Scanlan.
Matt: All right. What's the save on that?
Taliesin: Wow. Where is it?
Marisha: You got to sort through all your coffee stains.
Taliesin: These are my coffee stains.
Marisha: He's really irritable.
Sam: Jesus, you have so many things.
Taliesin: Yes, I do. It's a--
Laura: I hug Trinket.
Taliesin: Ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency bonus.
Marisha: Keyleth sits next to Vex and lays her head on her shoulder.
Sam: Against AC?
Taliesin: Against you.
Sam: Oh. (laughs) I'm out.
Taliesin: Yeah. That's a six, 12, 24, I think.
Matt: Okay and what's the-- or it just hits and he has to make--
Taliesin: It just hits. You can make a strength check against 20.
Matt: To try and break out of it as an action, right? So as you finish your statement, Percival throws an orb at you and it expands, locks you up into this cage of metal bars and claws and chains, and you're locked in place, unable to move.
Sam: Feels right.
Travis: Was that necessary?
Taliesin: I'll let him out when I'm feeling like it.
Travis: Makes sense.
Marisha: I don't have the strength to argue with him.
Laura: Sorry, Scanlan.
Sam: (muffled) It's okay. I'm okay in here.
Taliesin: Actually, I'll unlock it so he can say that.
Sam: Oh, hi. That was a very touching ceremony. Well, I'll just be in here, crying.
Marisha: Aw.
Laura: Percy, please let him out, I can't take it right now.
Taliesin: I very quickly go through Scanlan's pockets to make sure there's nothing else that I need to take back from him.
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Taliesin: Thank you. Nope. I let him out. Manners.
Marisha: That might be the last natural one of this campaign. You have to scream it from a mountaintop, man.
Sam: The golden snitch!
Laura: How could you do that?
Marisha: Betrayal.
Matt: It's mine now. (laughter)
Travis: A celestial hand reaches out of the clouds.
Matt: Hello, next campaign.
Laura: Oh shit.
Marisha: One man's trash.
Laura: Keyleth, dear.
Marisha: Yes?
Laura: I know it was never made official, but I'm assuming you two would've spent your life together. As much of it as he had, anyway.
Marisha: He taught me how to love and I have a hard time with interpersonal relationships.
Laura: I would've never known.
Marisha: So I would've held onto that one for as long as I could've. And I still will.
Laura: I still count you as my sister.
Marisha: As I count you as mine. Going to have to look out for each other now.
Laura: Yes.
Taliesin: I'm going to quietly wander outside.
Matt: You're on the platform outside.
Taliesin: Oh, I'm going to break off for a second.
Marisha: Also, fuck that raven bitch.
Laura: She's terrible.
Marisha: What the fuck?
Laura: You know we have a temple to her in Whitestone. I mean, here's the thing though. I feel like I want to destroy it because I hate her so much, but at the same time, I feel like we should leave it because maybe we can talk to him through it. We'll try it.
Travis: Pike.
Ashley: Yeah?
Travis: While we're here, I feel like if Bahamut is the natural enemy of Tiamat, I don't know if I want to be bound to this sword for much longer. I feel like my time of hunting Vecna is done. I feel like we have Arkhan's hand. Maybe if we handed it over to the Platinum-- these people?
Ashley: Okay. Yeah.
Travis: Then somebody else could take up that hunt, right?
Ashley: If that's what you want, Grog. I don't think that's a bad idea.
Travis: Yeah. Okay. I think I want to turn over this sword, but would you stay with me?
Ashley: Of course I will.
Travis: He's very persuasive. Actually, Scanlan, will you come with me also?
Sam: Absolutely.
Travis: All right. Can I make my way back towards somebody official-looking?
Matt: That would be either Highbearer Vord or the one you met earlier.
Travis: Highbearer Orb sounds good.
Matt: As you step back into the Platinum Sanctuary, the voice creeps in your head. "I know not what you're thinking, but know: together we are more powerful than anyone who's wielded me. We could take him down. We could destroy it all. You cannot, you will not discard me."
Travis: Anyone ever? Stronger than anyone that's ever wielded you?
Matt: "Anyone who's ever wielded me. Together, we could bring down anything that bears his title. Anyone who pursues his power."
Ashley: Grog?
Travis: Yeah?
Ashley: What's he saying?
Travis: (sighs) You make a really good point. We're really strong together and unstoppable.
Matt: You feel this (pulse) in your brain, there's a flash vision of the hand, once held in your grasp, swollen atop the actual body of Vecna in the battle. Your vision comes back and that urge in your belly creeps up.
Travis: I mean, hold on, Pike. Maybe we could do a lot of good. We could really rid the world of a lot of bad stuff.
Ashley: Listen, we did that before you knew this sword. We're all strong together. You were strong before it and you'll be strong after it.
Travis: (exhales) Okay. (strained) Highbearer Orb, a moment, please.
Matt: As you enter the chamber once more, the Highbearer turns around. "Yes, Grog Strongjaw, what do you require?"
Travis: I would like to make a deposit.
Matt: "Go on."
Travis: I have on my person the Sword--
Matt: Make a wisdom saving throw.
Travis: Okay. 14.
Matt: The words don't escape your mouth and you realize this was a bad idea.
Travis: (sighs) I'm so sorry to waste your time. I wanted to thank you for hosting us. Bidet. And I start to turn and walk out.
Ashley: I grab him by the hand. So he can't go anywhere.
Sam: Are you not doing this, Grog?
Travis: It's a bad idea.
Matt: "We could do so much together. We can destroy anyone who's ever thought to pray to the now Undying King sealed away. We could wipe his presence from this planet!"
Travis: (strained) Together we could do so much, we could dry eraser-board the planet.
Sam: Whatever your wishes are, Grog. I'll go along with it. If you wish to keep the sword, that's fine with me.
Travis: I want to keep it.
Sam: Great.
Ashley: Scanlan, I don't think this is a good idea.
Sam: Okay. Sell me on this.
Ashley: Look at him!
Sam: He's just flexing his face muscles.
Ashley: He's getting all weird.
Travis: (strained) I want to keep it!
Sam: No, he does this when he needs to go poo. I've seen him do it.
Ashley: I know. He definitely does this when he needs to go poo. But this is so much worse!
Sam: I mean, it's been a hard day. I think we all need a really good bowel movement.
Travis: I start walking out of the Sanctuary.
Matt: Pike, make a strength check.
Ashley: No. Yes.
Matt: So roll and add your strength modifier, which I think is four.
Ashley: It's five.
Matt: Oh, it's five.
Laura: She's got the gauntlets on.
Matt: Gauntlets bring it to 19, so it'll be a plus four, I'm pretty sure.
Ashley: Wait, I think I had a plus one somewhere.
Sam: Did you get some boon or boost or something?
Ashley: With a plus four, it's 17.
Matt: 17. Grog, roll a strength check.
Laura: Roll a one! Roll a one!
Travis: 19.
Matt: 19. Pike, your feet begin to scrape against the marble as Grog's form and strength, which is just a little bit more than you. He's a little more monster than your monster right now.
Ashley: Can I swing my other hand up and try to pull more?
Matt: I'll allow you one more strength check with disadvantage.
Sam: Really conflicted here.
Travis: (strained) I want to help the planet.
Sam: He seems totally normal to me.
Ashley: 14.
Matt: Grog, roll another strength check.
Travis: 15.
Matt: Still, your metal boots are scraping across the marble as you're pulling and trying to hold him back as he's walking out the room. The voice says, "Yes. Together, the two of us."
Travis: (strained) Just the two of us. We can make it if we try! Just the two of us, Kas and I.
Matt: Highbearer Vord says, "Is everything all right?"
Sam: Pike, do you want me to try to stop him? What's going on?
Ashley: I think this is not a good idea. Grog, this is something you wanted to do. You need to fight it.
Travis: Can I try and fight it?
Matt: You already lost at the moment. So yeah, he's currently locked into that mindset.
Sam: Pike, should I do something or no?
Ashley: Well, I think we could both do something, but I want Grog to fight this.
Sam: Why don't I help him fight it? I will cast Suggestion on Grog, using my last level two spell. And suggest that he think long and hard about maybe fighting back against this sword. One more time.
Ashley: Then if it doesn't work, I have an idea.
Matt: All right. So bringing up Suggestion here, make a wisdom saving throw, Grog.
Travis: 11.
Matt: 11. Okay. As the suggestion creeps through your mind, the familiar voice of Scanlan through your ears gives you just enough moment of pause to allow you an additional saving throw against the influence.
Travis: Maybe I'll take mine-- is it a wisdom saving throw?
Matt: Yes, it is.
Travis: That's a five.
Taliesin: My god, we're saved.
Matt: The suggestion does not seem to take hold and he's now dragged Pike almost back to the entryway of the Platinum Sanctuary and the Highbearer is still looking a bit confused.
Sam: He's made his choice.
Ashley: No! Grog. Stop just one moment.
Travis: Okay. I stop.
Ashley: And I look him in the eyes, I cast Greater Restoration. Still have another slot left, will that work?
Matt: I would like you to go ahead and make a wisdom check. This is contested against the wisdom of the sword.
Ashley: I'm casting it at 7th-level because that's all I have left.
Matt: You know what, it's not going to have much of an effect on this really, unfortunately. But the spell's cast. So roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier.
Marisha: You're smarter than a sword!
Ashley: Do I get an advantage?
Matt: Unfortunately, no in the circumstance. Just roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier, which I believe is a five?
Ashley: I have. Yeah, it's five. So nine.
Marisha: Oh!
Sam: Oh!
Matt: Well, (laughs).
Ashley: You die.
Matt: Yeah, you actually die. No. That's not worth it. It's fine.
Sam: Vax comes back and kills you.
Matt: Yeah. I rolled a seven and he has a wisdom modifier of plus one.
Laura: Oh shit!
Marisha: Oh my god, you did it!
Matt: Like I legitimately-- that's pretty stupid.
Taliesin: Did you use my die?
Matt: No, I did not use your die. I used my purple one. I'm saving yours for the next campaign. So as the strength of wills between the cleric and the sword begin to combat, the warmth of Pike's friendship and the force of Sarenrae's guidance washes through your body and the cold steel of the sword begins to warm to the touch. And for a brief minute, it gets so warm it's hot. It burns your fingertips and you instinctively throw the blade to the ground. It clatters and slides about 15 feet from you, spiralling and sparking across the marble floor. The Highbearer's foot catches it in place. He leans forward. "Now I'm certainly curious."
Travis: (deep breath) It is the Sword of Kas.
Matt: You watch as the color begins to somewhat return to Grog's face, his eyes returning to their natural pigment. The sallow, sunken features of his body begin to fill out once more, the influence of the blade having left his psyche and physicality.
Ashley: Oh. You're back to light gray again. You look great.
Travis: I'm feeling so achy. What happened? Whew!
Ashley: You made a decision and I felt it was the right thing to do.
Travis: Yeah. We kept the sword, right?
Ashley: Yeah, it's there.
Sam: They're holding it for you.
Travis: Oh. Okay.
Matt: At this point, you can see two of the other Scalebearer guardians have flanked the sides of the Highbearer. As he removes his foot from the blade and steps back, they both carefully lift it with a gauntlet and present it before him and he glances down. "So you say this blade aided you?"
Travis: Yes. That blade, careful with it, very powerful. He is bent on the destruction of one thing and one thing only. Vecna.
Matt: "Good to know. We'll keep this within our vaults in case the day or time arises."
Travis: Wait! I have something else. Then I show the hand of Arkhan.
Matt: "Yes?" It flops limply in your grasp.
Travis: Oh! The person that owned this hand-- okay, stay with me. Chopped this off and took Vecna's hand and stuck it on and then this got left over. So this is not his hand anymore and the one that he does have is Vecna's. So if you use your noodle, you can use this to trace him.
Matt: "There are limitations to the use of such objects. It may be of some aid to us, but the knowledge of this individual is far more important. However, we will accept this thing." And he ushers his hand forward and another servant comes forward and retrieves the hand from you and folds the fingers up and places it within a small pillow. Backs away.
Ashley: I think that was a great idea.
Travis: Yeah, right? It was pretty smart.
Ashley: Yes, it was very smart.
Matt: "What was the name of this? This current wielder of the Hand of Vecna."
Travis: Arkin. Arkeen?
Sam: Arkhan.
Travis: Arkhan. Arkhan the Fool. The Cruel. The--
Sam: Misguided.
Matt: "Arkhan the Misguided?"
Travis: Don't underestimate him. He's really buff and devious.
Sam: And he's got another hand that he could chop off too. One in reserve.
Matt: "Very well. So we'll begin to do research and seek out this Arkhan the Cruel?"
Travis: Cool. Yeah, he was pretty cool. He was pretty cool.
Sam: I was fighting a god. I didn't really catch his name.
Travis: Well see, don't hurt him. He actually helped us defeat Vecna. He pulled a tricksy-doodle and took the hand.
Matt: "I would do whatever it takes to not trust individuals who would steal such an artifact with their own means."
Travis: Sure.
Matt: "We'll find this individual. Rest assured. The will of Bahamut turned on him now, I doubt he'll find a place to hide. Thank you very much."
Travis: Yep. Beep beep. All right, Pike, shall we away?
Ashley: We shall away.
Travis: Scanlan, shall we away?
Sam: Away we shall.
Travis: Away we-- oui oui?
Ashley: Oui oui!
Sam: Oui oui!
Sam: Bidet.
Travis: Bidet.
Ashley: Bidet.
Matt: "Bidet." As you exit the Sanctuary, you meet up with the rest of your friends that are still taking their quiet moments of reflection on the exterior platform on the outside of the Sanctuary overlooking the eastern side of Vasselheim.
Ashley: How do you feel?
Travis: I feel good. I feel like pursuing Vecna was something that we all did together and I feel like whatever we do now is new and I felt like I was going to have to do that on my own and I don't want to do that.
Laura: Grog, you wouldn't have to do anything on your own.
Travis: That's good to know.
Laura: Yeah. We're in this together.
Sam: I've got a thing, actually, I've got to get to.
Laura: Can I walk over to Percy? Are you still over by yourself?
Taliesin: Well, yeah. I'll take care of something. I'm sitting in a corner and I'm staring into the reflection of my sword. And I'm gently tapping the contract in my pocket. And I'm going to say, Ipkesh.
Laura: No. I'm going to sit down next to you.
Taliesin: You're too late. You've been doing a thing. Could you bring him back? Would it, the thing that you gave me, bring him back?
Matt: There's no answer.
Taliesin: Hmm. Nothing at all. All right.
Laura: Now I'm going to sit down next to you. How are you?
Taliesin: I have no idea. I think I really miss my family. I think I miss my sisters and my parents. I think I was going to be a clockmaker once. I haven't thought about that. There was a moment. Do you remember when we met?
Laura: I do.
Taliesin: I, for a brief time, thought that I had died within that prison and I was having a fever dream from starvation and this was what that felt like, was my mind making stories of friends and adventures and these things I would never do because I was a coward and fool. I miss my family so much and I've done some terrible things. I gave Grog that sword.
Laura: You did.
Taliesin: It didn't feel real.
Laura: Now it does.
Taliesin: I don't know. This is new. I'm sorry.
Laura: What were you going to do? Are you going to fight the Raven Queen for me?
Taliesin: Many years ago, I went to make a deal with her and she told me that I was broken and that I had always been broken. Part of me was going to save your brother and really, I just wanted to prove it to her. I wanted to hurt her for hurting me.
Laura: I think we're all broken, Percy.
Taliesin: I am so tired of hurting people.
Laura: You don't have to hurt anyone anymore.
Taliesin: I love you very much.
Laura: I love you.
Taliesin: This has been a terrible day.
Laura: It's horrible!
Taliesin: Where's Kiki? Where's Scanlan? I think I owe him an apology. Oh god, I owe Grog an apology. Maybe I'll not apologize to Grog. That sounds like a really terrible idea.
Laura: Darling.
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: You're a good person and you're not broken anymore. All right? We'll filling each other's gaps. We'll be the glue.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: And don't do anything crazy anymore. No deals with Raven Queens, all right? Let's not fight any more gods.
Taliesin: I was going to say let's destroy the one in Whitestone. Maybe we could seal it up, leave it because you know, but--
Laura: I want to see if I can talk to him through it. Is that stupid?
Taliesin: How would I know? Seems worth a shot. I'm too tired to be angry.
Laura: We did a thing today. A pretty big thing.
Taliesin: Was that today? It legitimately feels like a week ago at this point. (laughter)
Taliesin: It's been a long day. Yeah, we'll rejoin. Sorry about Manners. That was rude.
Sam: Are you apologizing for something?
Taliesin: Yes.
Sam: That's stupid.
Taliesin: I know.
Sam: I never said sorry for leaving!
Taliesin: Yeah, but you're you. You don't have to apologize, we just assume.
Sam: Well, I'm sorry. Sorry I left.
Taliesin: I will not accept it so that when you come to your senses later, you don't feel like you've compromised. But thank you. (laughter)
Sam: That's fair.
Travis: You handing out apologies?
Taliesin: No. Yes. Sorry about the skull.
Marisha: Oh. I'm pretty sure you just handed out an apology after you just said you weren't going to hand out an apology.
Taliesin: I'm a human. I'm made of contradictions. You people wouldn't understand.
Marisha: I think Percy is a walking contradiction.
Travis: I will consider accepting your apology if you tell me whatever happened to it.
Taliesin: (sighs) Oh my god. I legitimately don't remember.
Marisha: I thought-- wait, we--
Matt: At that point, two hands drape around the side of Grog's shoulder up top and Vex as the long golden braids down the arms of Allura Vysoren says, "My friend Grog, best not to worry about it. Wherever it is, it's beyond our grasp now."
Travis: Okay, Allura. (laughter)
Marisha: Did you just sitcom mug? "Okay, Allura!" (laughter)
Matt: If we could've freeze-framed and rolled credits on that to end the campaign, I would have been happy. (laughs) Allura takes her hands back, then reaches over and musses up the side of Pike's hair. (sighs) "We've been through quite a bit together, haven't we?"
Laura: So much.
Matt: "Lot of ups and downs."
Marisha: You were quite an inspiration, Allura. I hope you know. You inspired me quite a lot.
Matt: "I'm only doing what everybody else is doing in this world: make it up as you go along."
Marisha: We know a lot about that. Allura, is Vasselheim going to be looking for members to join the council?
Matt: "Vasselheim? What do you mean? Vasselheim is mostly a religious council, if you know."
Marisha: Totally.
Matt: "I could put in a word, but I didn't consider this really your type of--"
Marisha: No, right.
Matt: "Here?"
Sam: She's asking for somebody else, I'm pretty sure she wasn't asking for her.
Marisha: I actually was, actually.
Matt: "Oh. I can inquire."
Marisha: I was thinking Pike, but I don't know--
Matt: "If I do recall, you have a temple here. One that you pretty much built."
Taliesin: How is that temple right now?
Matt: "That's a very good question. Pike? Would you like to go see your temple?"
Ashley: I would like to go see my temple.
Matt: "Very well." She waves her fingers a bit and casts Fly on all of you.
Laura: Oh shit, on everybody?!
Matt: On a high enough level, you can.
Ashley: Whoa.
Travis: Pike! Go upside down! (wookiee growl)
Laura: That was the best wookiee noise you've ever made, babe!
Taliesin: That was a really good wookiee noise.
Travis: (mediocre wookiee growl)
Matt: Retracted immediately. As she was here helping defend, she didn't waste her 8th-level slot, she is able to get you guys all flying for the moment and you all coast. As she finishes casting the spell, you could see some of the nearby wardens of the Platinum Sanctuary go, "Um--" "I know it's arcane, shut up. It's fine." You all take off the steps and begin to glide down over to the city, and there you can already see people are coming out of their homes. Exactly. So eventually, you find your way north to the Quadroads, towards the base of the Heaven Stair Mountain, where the temple resides. The temple looks like it's sustained a little bit of damage. It looks like a portion of the upper floor of the three-tier tower-- Colosseum-esque, but it does taper a bit towards the top. The top part has partially fallen in and it looks like it's seen wear and tear, but it doesn't look like it's been destroyed or anything. As you come up to the temple, you can already see there are refugees of homes that were destroyed from the incursion of the Braving Grounds that are being gathered in and the temple's filled with people. On the outside, you see Gesyra, the older woman who helped you found the temple and build it. As she approaches, she's now one of the Priests of Rebirth and has been working with you for some time and turns and sees your face. You can see her graying hair, which is bunned up very tightly in the back. She has her spectacles and she has the long robes of blue and gold. She sees you. "My Pike!" She rushes up and gives you a hug. She's much bigger than you, being a human, but her posture puts her almost on your level. "I'm so glad you're safe."
Ashley: It's so wonderful to see your face.
Matt: "We've housed who we can. We're a bit at capacity at the moment."
Ashley: Okay. Well, it looks a bit better than I thought it would.
Matt: "We did our best to defend. Is it done?"
Ashley: It's done.
Matt: You see her eyes crack at that moment and tears begin to flow. She smiles. "I knew you could do it."
Ashley: Well, we all did.
Matt: She looks around at the rest of you, pats you on the head for a minute and pulls away and goes, "You get to wear the greatest outfits, don't you?"
Ashley: (giggles)
Matt: "Well, anything you need, food, we have room for a few more."
Sam: I would suggest that we-- there's bars here, right? In Vasselheim? They drink, don't they?
Matt: Oh, yeah. There's bars here.
Marisha: Maybe they do a dry city after a certain time.
Matt: Are you kidding me? Religion and alcohol go together perfectly. That's a time-honored tradition!
Sam: Why don't we go find a tavern somewhere and let these people pick up the pieces, and give them their space?
Marisha: Do you need any type of water, or anything we can immediately assist you with?
Matt: "Clean water would be wonderful."
Marisha: Do you have somewhere to put it?
Matt: "Just a moment!" And she goes inside for a moment and calls out, four of the other lower acolytes of Sarenrae's temple, and they all have various buckets and reservoirs--
Marisha: I burn as many Create Water spells as it takes to fill them up.
Matt: They bring you inside, where there's the large statue of Sarenrae, where you had your first vision that called you to come find her. And there is a fountain as part of that and a reservoir in the bottom that has currently been mostly emptied to facilitate everyone here who needed water or to clean wounds. You help fill that and you very, very quickly manage to get the temple back to an easily sustainable level.
Taliesin: Pike?
Ashley: Yes?
Taliesin: I could use your assistance. I don't think I should have this, and I need this to be taken away from me before I do something foolish. And I hand Pike my contract.
Ashley: (sighs) I take it. Percy, what is this?
Taliesin: This, I thought, was proof that I was in control of myself. But it's just a terrible thing waiting to happen.
Sam: Ashley, I just texted you the contract.
Taliesin: Thank you. How do you have it on autosave?! Do you just have it?
Sam: Yeah.
Ashley: I mean, I somewhat know what it is.
Taliesin: I don't think it can be destroyed. But maybe it can be put far away.
Ashley: I will keep this, at the very least, very far from you.
Taliesin: I have every faith in you. Thank you. I think I'm done with that.
Sam: Pike, I have a porno book that I really think I shouldn't have anymore. Can I give it to you to take it away--
Taliesin: I'll take it away!
Sam: Oh, you'll take it? Okay.
Travis: I would like to bid on it, as well. Yeah, I have some money still--
Sam: It's not great.
Taliesin: Can you text it to us actually?
Ashley: Could you text me the book?
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: That's a three jpeg, man. Sorry.
Matt: So you guys go off to find a tavern and drink together?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: Yeah. We need to go have some toasts to Vax.
Laura: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Laura: You said Allura took Velora?
Matt: Yeah. Well, at this point, she's probably still carrying her with you.
Laura: Oh, okay. I thought you said Allura took her away. Okay.
Matt: Yeah, because Allura took her off of you-- You know what? No, she's probably being tended to at the Platinum Sanctuary at the moment, seeing to her wounds.
Laura: Did I just leave her? I feel weird just leaving her.
Marisha: She'll be fine. She'll be safe.
Travis: She's in some pretty solid hands.
Laura: I'll run back and talk to her.
Matt: Okay. So you head back into the Sanctuary and retrieve her.
Laura: I'm going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up.
Matt: She was. Thankfully, there are a number of clerics and healers available that can take a moment away from the wounded of the battle to deal with a little girl. And when you come to her, she's still a bit battered and bruised. But she's all right.
Laura: Is there anyone who can send me to Syngorn?
Taliesin: Why doesn't she stay with us for a while?
Matt: You're asking this of anybody at the temple?
Laura: Do you think we should--
Sam: We can take a day.
Taliesin: I think maybe a little time spent in our company, as opposed to your father's company, would not be the worst idea.
Laura: Maybe a message of Sending. Can anyone do that? Pike? Do you have the message of Sending?
Sam: To whom?
Laura: To my father.
Marisha: To let him know that his daughter is still alive.
Ashley: I don't have it with me, but I--
Laura: Okay. Allura, you've done it before.
Matt: "Yes."
Laura: Could you send something to my father?
Matt: "I could. I could also bring her there, if you'd like."
Laura: No. Velora, would you want to go home right now?
Matt: Right now she's holding onto your neck a bit. She looks at you. "I miss you."
Laura: I miss you too.
Matt: "Can I stay a bit longer?"
Laura: Okay.
Matt: "Okay."
Taliesin: I think that's a great idea.
Laura: I think so too. Allura, will you say that Velora is safe, and that I'll be paying a visit very soon to return her?
Matt: "I believe that," and for a moment she looks just beyond your eyes, squints, "he's aware."
Laura: Thank you.
Matt: "So to drinks?"
Laura: To drinks.
Taliesin: To drinks.
Matt: "I don't really drink. But after a day like today, I think I need one."
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Apple juice for you, little one!
Matt: She giggles in your ear. All right.
Laura: I'm bringing my sister to a bar.
Sam: Your nearly dead sister.
Marisha: Yeah. She's going to have to be introduced at some point.
Matt: Yeah. Allura takes a moment and squints her eyes for a second, apparently Sending another message, and then nodding. She leads you guys towards the Quadroads, and finds a pub called The Quarry's End. And it's not too far from Sarenrae's temple, which is why she chose it, and it looks to be like it was near a quarry that was built into the mountain that either dried up or was closed down for some reason, and then a tavern was opened instead as a means of still making money. It's super dive-y, it smells of stained wood and spilled wine. It's musty and perfect. And as you all come in, it's mostly empty, as people are still in the process of trying to figure things out. The few that are in there appear to be wounded soldiers that, as opposed to getting medical help, are in the process of drinking themselves into a numb state. But you find a table, you sit down, one of the barmaids comes up to you, goes: "Drinking away the fray, are you?"
Taliesin: I put, like, 20 gold on the table.
Matt: "Oh!"
Taliesin: We will take the cheapest, worst beer you have, and a round for everyone in the bar.
Matt: "But of course, sir! My pleasure!" Takes the coin.
Taliesin: If everyone's all right with that.
Laura: Of course, dear.
Travis: Can I also start pulling out the remaining eight expensive-ass bottles of wine from the bag of holding?
Marisha: Hell yeah! Drunk as shit! Now's the time!
Matt: Within moments, your table is covered in terrible beer and really expensive wine!
Travis: Expensive-ass!
Laura: That's what you wrote down, too.
Travis: Expensive-ass bottles of wine.
Matt: You pull two tables together and you guys are in the process-- You're a fair bit into your cups, and then the somewhat ajar door on the exterior slams open as the light filters in from the outside, and there you see standing the general half-height of an armored halfling, partially bloodied, armor dented as shit.
Travis: Kima!
Marisha: Kima!
Matt: Kima, as she walks in, sauntering in, with her blade being sheathed in the back of her giant scabbard, her Holy Avenger. "Got your message, honey! Not going to pass up a drink after a day like this!" (cracking) "Ow, ow, ow!" She comes and sits down next to Allura and puts her arm around her real fast. "This is new!" and points to the drink in front of Allura.
Taliesin: It's a special occasion.
Marisha: We're bad influences.
Travis: Yeah. Desperate times and all that.
Matt: "Good. I guess that's why we're friends."
Marisha: I see you're working the late shift.
Matt: "Well, you know. When there's streets crawling with skeletons, I got to be there."
Taliesin: Been having a good time, then?
Matt: "Oh, it's been amazing! It's been terrible! Terrible. But amazing!"
Marisha: Well, we frontloaded our hours.
Laura: Can we have another cup?
Matt: "Yeah!" The barmaid comes by, gets another cup, and leaves you guys all to drink and swap stories.
Taliesin: That thing that I was bugging you about?
Marisha: Which one? You bug me about a lot of things.
Taliesin: Well, that's fair. Now that I have a bit of alcohol in me.
Marisha: Yeah, and you ask me after I have a bit of alcohol in me. And I scry on Cassandra.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Oh god, he flipped a page. I hate that.
Matt: You take a long, deep sip of your drink and then close your eyes as you complete the scrying ritual you've half-scrawled on the dark wood wall on the side of the tavern. Your vision goes cloudy, and you feel yourself being transitioned rapidly through wind and cloud as the temperature of your atmosphere begins to drop, and there, you begin to break cloud cover to look down upon Whitestone. Your vision jumps once more to the exterior of the castle, jumps once more, and there you see, lying in bed, covers pulled up to her chest, with at least three different servants and one medical personnel there at her side, bag open, tending to her wounds. She's asleep, but she's breathing.
Marisha: Looks like she's been tended to like a proper de Rolo.
Laura: Did you see Kaylie and Gilmore?
Marisha: Did I see Kaylie and Gilmore?
Matt: Not in the room, no.
Taliesin: She made it back to Whitestone. One would assume that's how she got there.
Marisha: She was not doing well. Gilmore was the most able-bodied. I'm assuming he got her there. I hope.
Taliesin: I'm sure. I have faith.
Marisha: I'll scry on the rest of them tomorrow.
Taliesin: I'm drunk. Don't get used to it.
Marisha: Faithless until the end.
Taliesin: Faithless until the end.
Marisha: Thank you, Percy.
Taliesin: Thank you, Keyleth.
Marisha: You taught me just the right amount of how to be a shithead. Just enough.
Sam: We should toast to Vax'ildan, our fallen member.
Matt: At which point, Kima goes, "Yeah, where is that asshole, anyway?"
Sam: He's really stealthy.
Matt: "Ain't that the truth. All right." She grabs her cup.
Laura: Apple juice.
Matt: She's holding a cup.
Sam: What do you have, Ashley?
Ashley: I have a cup, and it's a vintage cup. I don't need to talk about this. (laughter)
Matt: Glasses raised, and at this point as the glasses are raised, you can hear whispers off to the side. You glance over, and you can see one of the nearby tables, which is filled with four Bastions who had been drinking to the battle and have now taken notice and seemingly recognized who's at the table across the way. They're all staring, and they all grab their glasses and raise them, too.
Laura: To Vax'ildan. He was the best of us.
Marisha: The most selfless.
Sam: The most frequently naked.
Marisha: Second to you.
Travis: The most frustrating.
Taliesin: The brightest and the darkest.
Sam: That's true. To Vax.
All: To Vax.
Matt: "So. What comes next?"
Travis: What does come next?
Marisha: (sighs) It's hard to think after a day that feels like a week, like today.
Laura: Syngorn and Whitestone, I would assume.
Taliesin: Home for a bit, at least. And of course, everybody is welcome, always.
Marisha: I've got to get back to Zephrah.
Sam: Do we have to check on Greyskull Keep?
Laura: In Emon?
Sam: I don't know.
Laura: Someone should stay there.
Travis: We left it as an outpost. I wouldn't mind going back to Whitestone for a bit.
Taliesin: I'll also say, for those of you, especially. Grog, you have your freedoms, and if you wanted to become lord of Greystone and have a place of your own that you could invite us to, as opposed to wandering.
Marisha: Greyskull?
Taliesin: Greyskull.
Travis: (hesitant noises)
Laura: Or you could just hang in Whitestone.
Travis: I'll think about it. It seems like that has responsibilities.
Laura: The Grand Poobah has a lot of responsibilities, too.
Travis: I do. There is an updated tour.
Sam: We'll go to Whitestone and figure it out. That's where Kaylie is, right? We assume.
Laura: Potentially.
Marisha: I don't think I can go back to Whitestone with you.
Laura: Why?
Sam: Oh, why? You've got to go back to your people?
Marisha: I have to go back to Zephrah.
Taliesin: Well, I think we're going to need help getting to Whitestone, and then I think it's going to take at least a day for you to regain the power to return to your people.
Marisha: Bad influences, all of you. Assholes.
Taliesin: We're not getting rid of you quite that easily.
Marisha: All right. One day.
Travis: If you can bear it.
Marisha: And then I want to not see your faces for a bit.
Sam: Sure, that makes sense. Pikey-poo, where are you going?
Ashley: Well, I'd like to come with you guys for a little bit because frankly, I don't really want to be alone for a while.
Taliesin: I don't think any of us do.
Travis: I pull her into the biggest hug.
Ashley: Oh, P-- oh, Grog.
Travis: You almost called me your own name. It's okay. You'll be fine.
Ashley: I was going to call you Poobah, but then I wanted to say your real name.
Marisha: We could go back to Whitestone whenever. I've still got a little bit of juice left.
Laura: You've got enough juice to get us to Whitestone right now?
Marisha: I do, believe it or fucking not.
Travis: I don't. You gave us the option.
Marisha: What?
Travis: You said believe it or fucking not. I call nope.
Marisha: Oh, it was more of a rhetorical-- it's like a trick or treat-- why do we still try to explain things to him? I haven't learned.
Ashley: Because he's learning.
Matt: Kima's clasping her cup and goes, "I can watch this all day."
Travis: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: He learns something new every day.
Taliesin: How did Whitestone look?
Matt: It's blurred at a distance. Aside from the specific target of your scrying, you don't get much of a vision, just an idea of the blurry exterior.
Laura: Should we drunkenly walk to the tree?
Sam: Are we transporting tonight? Why don't we chill for a night?
Laura: Don't you want to see your daughter?
Sam: Well, of course, but I'm drunk and bloody.
Marisha: We can drunkenly walk there and take our time and enjoy the stars and we can-- oh! Scanlan--
Sam: Did you have a drink?
Marisha: Scanlan.
Sam: What can we do?
Marisha: We can do little arcane cantrips when no one's looking and break the rules a little bit. Of Vasselheim. Just cantrips, though.
Sam: You're such a rebel.
Marisha: I know.
Taliesin: I forgot.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: No, you're fine.
Marisha: What?
Taliesin: Nothing. You're fine. Love you very much.
Marisha: I've lost the love of my life today. I'm allowed to be belligerent.
Taliesin: You are.
Travis: Are we throwing caution to the wind?
Sam: Sure.
Travis: I do have something that might up the party a little bit.
Sam: Okay, what is it?
Travis: I reach into the bag of holding and I pull out a little leather pouch.
Marisha: Do you have that sandkheg shit?
Laura: No.
Travis: What?
Sam: What is that? What have you got?
Travis: So I've got this little deck of cards and every time someone pulls from it, great shit happens.
Ashley: I'm in.
Travis: One. Two. Scanlan?
Sam: I've seen this before, haven't I? I think I was with you when you got the guy rich. Wasn't I?
Matt: No, he was on his own.
Travis: He's the Lord of the Quadroads now.
Sam: I was with him when he did one of them, though.
Matt: You're semi-aware that there's something going on. Make an arcana check.
Taliesin: Oh, this could go so badly.
Sam: 15.
Matt: 15. Something creeping in the back of your mind, something you've learned, something you've heard, really tells you that this is powerful and chaotic.
Sam: I'll watch for now.
Travis: You'll partake.
Sam: Probably.
Travis: Three. Percy?
Taliesin: I think I've had enough for one day.
Sam: If we're going to do that, we should go back to Whitestone first.
Travis: Why? This place is already fucked up. Let's get it on. Keyleth?
Marisha: I am drunk enough to where I'm not going to stop it or argue against it, but I won't partake, so that's pretty good for me.
Travis: Why are you so resistant to gifts and wonder? Magic?
Marisha: Grog, you've had two weapons speak to you--
Travis: Don't be jelly.
Laura: Nothing powerful comes without a price. We saw that. We just saw that with the Raven Queen. Power comes at a price. You think that wonderful things are going to be pulled out of your hands here, and there's going to be no consequences?
Travis: Pretty much.
Marisha: Grog, haven't we been through enough shit to know nothing's free?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Fuck it.
Travis: Here or Whitestone?
Taliesin: Oh, definitely not at Whitestone.
Travis: All right. Pike, you want one? (laughter)
Taliesin: I've always worried about the two of you.
Ashley: Well, I think you should pick a card, and we deal with one as of right now. And then maybe I'll pick one later.
Travis: Well, jeez, I thought we were all having tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures and writing our name on the bathroom walls, but it seems like everybody's lost their nerve. I put it back in the bag of holding. (laughter and groaning)
Matt: You're such an asshole!
Taliesin: You're such a dick.
Laura: Don't do it!
Marisha: You insult our resolve and hold out on us all at the same time?
Travis: The night's still young.
Ashley: Ugh, just pick one!
Matt: All right.
Sam: We're traveling now? We're drunk!
Marisha: Yeah!
Taliesin: Let's drive a tree. It'll be fun.
Matt: You all wander outside of the tavern, find your way over to the nearest tree that's functional. It takes you a little bit, because a lot of trees look thicker at a distance when you're drunk than when you approach.
Marisha: Yeah, no, this one won't work. No, this won't work. Sorry.
Taliesin: That's more of a shrub.
Marisha: Sorry. Next one. That one looks good.
Taliesin: Yes, that looks nice.
Sam: That's a young boy.
Taliesin: Oh, yes.
Matt: Eventually, you find the tree that'll work, which is interesting, because you have this combination of people that are recognizing you as Vox Machina, as the whispered saviors of the town as you drunkenly stumble through the city streets, naught but hours after sealing a recently ascended god. It's strangely so perfect for you. As you approach the tree that you find that'll work, Allura has her arm over Kima. She's a lightweight. "You go on ahead. We need to help here with the construction effort."
Laura: You've got to get your construction on?
Matt: "No, we're just--" And then Kima goes, "Yes!"
Travis: (laughing) She doesn't handle that booze very well.
Matt: "We'll see you soon. Travel safe, and thank you."
Sam: Love you.
Matt: "Okay." (laughter)
Matt: Kima drags her hand. Kima's drank far more, but is sober. She can hold her liquor. "All right, thank you, guys!" And grabs her hand and pulls her off, and they both wave bye as they step back into the city. You complete your spell, emerging from the exterior of the Sun Tree. Back in Whitestone, the comfort is here once more. It seems to be just past dusk at this point.
Marisha: (slurred) See? When you travel-- wait, no. When you travel west to east, you gain time. See?
Sam: Yeah, you called it.
Ashley: Time travel.
Marisha: (slurred) Happy hour is right now in Whitestone. Just saying.
Taliesin: Let's head home?
Sam: That works.
Marisha: Okay. Heading home works.
Matt: You guys make your way to the castle. Food is presented. Everyone's happy to see you back. What do you want to do?
Sam: Now or forever?
Matt: Oh, we'll get to the forever bit in a minute.
Marisha: Cry myself to sleep?
Sam: I want to go see Kaylie, I guess, if she's around. Are we hanging out together, or are we breaking off?
Laura: (quietly) Go see your daughter.
Sam: All right. I'm going to go see Kaylie.
Matt: Okay. Asking around a bit, it doesn't take much to find Kaylie in your old room in Whitestone, the one where you both left when you first exited the group for a short time. She's in there, bandaged up, and looks like she's taking a dagger and throwing it into the wall, then walking over and pulling it back out, sitting back on the bed and throwing it, and it bounces off. The hilt hits. She's like, "Fuck." Picks it back up and doesn't notice you in the doorway. As she sits back down, she looks over.
Sam: Hi.
Matt: "Hi."
Sam: You with a dagger in your hand's always a little scary.
Matt: "Why, does it frighten you?"
Sam: Not any--
Matt: "Boo!"
Sam: (yelps) Okay, it frightens me a little.
Matt: She sheathes it on the side.
Sam: You okay?
Matt: "I've had better days. I'm all right."
Sam: Good.
Matt: "You're alive."
Sam: Surprisingly, yes. We won.
Matt: "I figured, if you're standing here before me. That's good. Congratulations."
Sam: Thanks. I'm sorry that I had to go do that. I had to.
Matt: "I'd be disappointed if you'd've came back with me. More important things."
Sam: So what now? Do you want to go back to Ank'Harel and keep criming?
Matt: You watch for a brief second her tough exterior break, and you can see her eyes welling up a little bit. She looks at the ground for a minute, then looks back up at you. "I'm glad you're safe."
Sam: I'm so happy I got to see you again. I thought for a second that when we said goodbye, it was the last time.
Matt: "I didn't. I know you too well, at this point. You're too much of a turd to die."
Sam: That's true. Only good people die.
Matt: "I'd like to go back to Ank'Harel. I don't know if this whole Meat Man thing's for me anymore."
Sam: Yeah. No, I hear you. I don't know if it's for me, either. It was fun.
Matt: "It was a lot of fun!"
Sam: It felt like we were killing time a little bit. There's something else that we should do. I don't know what. Maybe your thing won't be my thing.
Matt: "Let's find someone to pass on the mantle to, eh?"
Sam: That's a good idea.
Matt: "I think the Meat Man should be there, just not us."
Sam: Yeah, that's a great idea. We'll train a replacement.
Matt: "Still take a percentage. I mean, we worked this hard!"
Sam: Passive income, right? It's the dream.
Matt: "It's the meat and potatoes of any good business venture."
Sam: I should have thought of that. That's amazing.
Matt: "That's why the daughter's an upgrade. After that, I don't know. I hate to admit it, but--"
Sam: Did you finish school?
Matt: "No."
Sam: Do you want to?
Matt: "Yeah."
Sam: All right. Well, let's do that, then. You go to school.
Matt: "I'm not really made for a lyceum. We can go visit. I didn't expect you to recommend schooling!"
Sam: Listen, I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, and I don't want you to make the same ones. I love you, and I want to support you in whatever you want to do, at this point. My time has come, and I've done my thing, and my thing is done, and now I want to help you do whatever it is that you want to do. If that means I can be close to you, then great, but if it doesn't, then I'll come visit every once in a while. We made quite a bit of money as the Meat Man.
Matt: "Aye, that we did."
Sam: And it's a good sum to get started.
Matt: "Would it be enough to pay for a right top-end education so I can gloat over all the other kids that are raised by the various lords and ladies of Emon? Become one of those privileged kids."
Sam: You can have the best education.
Matt: "That's what I want to do. I want to rub it in their face."
Sam: All right. Education for spite. I like that.
Matt: "That sounds like a Shorthalt endeavor."
Sam: Sure. Whatever you need.
Matt: She stands up from the bed and walks over and puts her hand on your shoulder in a pat, pat. She pulls you into a hug and rests her head on your shoulder and doesn't say anything.
Sam: You won't have to worry about me anymore.
Matt: "I'm going to worry about you every day."
Sam: Thank you. Thank you for coming into my life.
Matt: "Thank you for being enough of a shitbag to bring me into it."
Sam: I'm so happy. I made so many mistakes, but it turns out that some of them weren't mistakes, after all.
Matt: "I'm still young and unlearned. Time will tell." She pulls you a little tighter in.
Sam: I'll snuggle and fall asleep in the room at some point.
Matt: She smells the alcohol on your breath and (groans). "Go lie there. I'm going to--" (groans) She winces as her wound in her shoulder flares up. "I need some fresh air. You go to sleep." Exhaustion hits you, and you end up passing out at the foot of the bed.
Sam: I'm in my room now?
Matt: Yeah, your old room.
Laura: I'm going to tuck Velora into bed.
Matt: She's asleep by the time you get there. Travel and everything has tuckered her out. You tuck her in, put the blanket up.
Laura: I tiptoe out of the room, and I find Percy.
Taliesin: I'll be in Cassandra's room.
Laura: Percival?
Taliesin: Yes?
Laura: Could I talk to you for a moment?
Taliesin: Of course.
Laura: I completely understand if you want to stay with Cassandra for the night. Would you mind not being very comfortable, though? I was thinking of camping in the woods.
Taliesin: I think that sounds lovely, and you're always better than comfortable. I had a thought, actually. My god, it is hard surviving, isn't it? Perhaps Keyleth could use a friend right now, and I know that you carry one with you.
Laura: Trinket?
Taliesin: Just for a bit. I think she could use a companion who's not going to apologize or give too much sympathy.
Laura: Of course. I send Trinket to Keyleth's room.
Matt: As Trinket ascends the stairs, he looks back over the shoulder. (questioning noise)
Laura: She might cry a lot on you. All right, dear?
Matt: Makes it up the stairs.
Laura: It's going to be a lot harder to stay warm out in the woods now.
Taliesin: We'll figure something out. I grew up here. I'm used to it.
Laura: I wanted to remember how I used to camp with Vax when we were kids.
Taliesin: I'd like to see that.
Laura: I guess we go out and set up a little fire.
Matt: You guys make your way into the woods and set up a camp for the evening's rest together. Keyleth, are you in your room? The door (creaks) and Trinket comes in and stares right at you. (slurps) And licks up the side of your face. Your hair sticks up for a minute.
Marisha: Oh, buddy!
Matt: (bear noises) He leans in and plops down on the ground, a giant beanbag mound of bear fur.
Marisha: I cover Trinket with snot and tears as I sob into his belly. First night alone, but with Trinket.
Taliesin: Best teddy bear ever.
Marisha: Aware of the gesture. I cry.
Matt: Eventually the exhaustion and the alcohol hits you, and you fall asleep, cuddled up in the warm embrace of a very fantastic, recently meteor-struck bear.
Marisha: Drool and eyeliner and dirt.
Matt: Voice of the Tempest.
Sam: You were wearing eyeliner to our fight?
Marisha: Remember, I charcoal war-painted?
Sam: That makes sense.
Travis: Has everybody gone off?
Matt: Pike actually would still be around.
Travis: I make my way sneakily outside.
Matt: Pike, what are you doing?
Ashley: There's a couple of things.
Taliesin: There's a lovely tea rose garden in the back.
Sam: She's letting Grog go first.
Travis: Oh, really?
Ashley: If you wanted to go somewhere, sneak away.
Travis: Oh, you know, I was just gonna, um.
Matt: Who wants to go first? Pike? Grog? Who's going first?
Ashley: Just for a little bit, for about an hour, I want to go-- not deep into the woods where Percy and Vex are, but somewhere that's pretty for about an hour, and I'll make my way back.
Matt: As you're out there on your own, contemplating quietly, ruminating on the day, a faint howl finds the air, and stepping from the shadows, you see a large gray wolf: Galdric, the wolf that once belonged to the previous champion of the Raven Queen, Purvan, who was given charge over the forests on the outside. Saunters up to you. He is a large wolf. You are a tiny gnome. He steps up, sits next to you. In this little break in the trees where you can see the moon breaking through some of the passing clouds over Whitestone. The night is so cold, you can see your breath in the dark air through the beams of moonlight that make it through the canopy. As the wolf looks down at you, his intense eyes making a full scan of what you are, there's a recognition to his expression. The wolf looks back up. (howls) And gives a long, baleful howl, seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that one with a familiar path to his has found his way back to the realm of the Raven Queen, as well.
Ashley: You are a beautiful creature. This might be strange, but I give him a hug.
Matt: You hug Galdric. You're used to Trinket, who's pretty well manicured. Galdric, not so much. There are clusters of fur that are dirt-encrusted.
Travis: Shit in them.
Matt: Probably. He's not a full, ruined beast. He lives in the forest. Smells of earth, dust, and nature. Doesn't seem to react to your hug, but allows it.
Ashley: I sit next to him.
Matt: He seems to share the space with you for the time that you're in the forest. Not a strong connection, but an acknowledgement, mainly focusing on the moon before it passes through the canopy and is no longer visible.
Ashley: I came out here to build a little something, so I'm glad to have you out here for a little bit. Thank you for staying with me.
Matt: The one ear to the side perks open to listen to your statement, but the vision doesn't meet yours, still focused in space as it fades. You get the essence that the wolf acknowledges you.
Ashley: (sighs) I feel like Grog would be so happy right now to be around a wolf. I give him a scratch behind his ear.
Matt: He actually seems to enjoy it and gives into it. One of the giant hind legs of the wolf--
Ashley: Oh, that's a good boy. I give out a little howl.
Matt: He howls along with you. (howls)
Ashley: That was for my friend Vax.
Matt: The wolf gets up, circles you once, and makes his way into the darkness of the forest once more.
Ashley: Goodbye. After a bit, I head back.
Matt: Okay. Grog?
Travis: I wander outside, where I'm by myself. Do I see anyone?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Like it matters. Oh! 17.
Matt: Glancing about, there are some of the Pale Guard around. Nobody that you would be looking for, necessarily. You seem to be open to do as you please.
Sam: Yeah.
Travis: I pull a card.
Sam: Yes!
Taliesin: I'm so proud of you.
Marisha: Wait, where are you?
Laura: Outside of the castle.
Marisha: In the middle of fucking Whitestone?
Matt: Oh my god, Grog.
Ashley: Wait, as I'm walking back, do I see him at all?
Matt: (chuckles) Out in front of the castle, out in the courtyard area?
Travis: Yeah. It's nighttime.
Matt: Make a perception check, Pike.
Sam: Make it good.
Taliesin: Roll a natural 20.
Ashley: I rolled a natural 20.
Marisha: Shut your mouth!
Travis: I rolled a bunch of hit dice from our short rest.
Matt: As you're quietly climbing up the walkway to the base of Castle Whitestone--
Ashley: He's out in the open.
Matt: Yeah. You do. You look up and see Grog pull a card from the deck.
Ashley: I stand and watch for a moment.
Sam: Oh, here's the deck.
Laura: Oh my god. It is really happening. I can't fucking believe--
Marisha: Travis, pull good! Oh, please don't bring pit fiends on our heads.
Travis: I might have.
Sam: Negative two to everything.
Matt: Hold on. Deck of Many Things. All right, so. Grog, what did you pull?
Ashley: Oh shit.
Matt: Void.
Taliesin: Oh no!
Marisha: That can't be good.
Matt: I'm sure it's fine.
Laura: That's the worst one you could get!
Sam: The crew's laughing. Something's bad. Something's very bad.
Travis: I'm pretty sure--
Laura: That is so bad!
Taliesin: Oh my god! (laughs)
Sam: Wait, Pike saw him.
Matt: Pike.
Sam: You get a reaction.
Marisha: Did our internet go? (screaming and groaning)
Matt: Of all moments.
Taliesin: (cackles) This is your doing!
Matt: While we're here, Grog, I'm going to read you the card. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A Wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.
Sam: Wait, read it again.
Travis: I'll tell you. My soul is drawn from my body. My body is incapacitated. It is placed within an object that the DM chooses. A Wish spell will tell you the location of the object, but will not reverse the action.
Sam: Can anything reverse it?
Matt: Finding it and retrieving the object and restoring the soul.
Marisha: You fucking dick. You're a fucking dick!
Laura: Well, the campaign goes on for another-- I can't believe you just fucking did that.
Sam: Wait, she rolled.
Laura: Ashley?
Sam: She rolled something. Oh, that was her 20 from before.
Matt: Looks like we may have her back. Hopefully, because this is going to be-- oh my god.
Marisha: It is bad!
Sam: Oh my god, Travis. Why would you do that?
Matt: Give me the card. Let this be a lesson to everybody out there.
Laura: Oh my god!
Marisha: You said you weren't going to bring the Deck of Many Things into the game, and then you did!
Matt: No regrets.
Taliesin: Hashtag no regrets.
Matt: No "regerts" at all.
Taliesin: Oh god, I can't even.
Laura: Is Ashley texting?
Taliesin: She's just yelling obscenities.
Sam: Her internet just died.
Marisha: (mispronouncing) Worst fucking timing! Internet has gone! Timing! Worst fucking timing!
Taliesin: It's just obscenities. That's all it is.
Matt: So Grog, as you draw the card from the deck, your vision goes tunneled, dark, to a pinpoint: a singular pinpoint of deep, ruby red. And that's all. Your consciousness falls into a catatonic state.
Sam: Does she get a reaction or anything?
Matt: No.
Marisha: She doesn't get shit? She just watches?
Matt: She sees it happen.
Sam: With her 20, she saw!
Matt: I know. She's aware.
Sam: She can't yell? She can't cast something?
Matt: No, because he pulled the card. It's not a big (grunts). It's a (flip).
Sam: All right.
Matt: All righty, so.
Marisha: I guess we'll add that to our to do list.
Taliesin: I'd like to think that in the next campaign, we're going to find you in a glass coffin like Sleeping fucking Beauty.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: My body's still there.
Sam: She rolled a 17.
Marisha: So Grog's body is still there--
Matt: He's catatonic until the soul's returned.
Marisha: Catatonic.
Matt: To be fair, you've sealed Vecna. At level 19 and 20, this is not going to be an earth-shattering experience.
Marisha: Sure, it's just an annoyance.
Matt: And for the sake of the epilogue evening you guys, all planning to return to your various lives to relax--
Travis: I'm there catatonic with an open deck of cards in my hand like this.
Liam: You dingus!
Marisha: Goddamn it!
Travis: Somebody's going to find me.
Sam: To Grog! He was the dumbest of us all. He was the dumb and the dumb.
Taliesin: May he rest in bed sores for all eternity.
Matt: You spend the next two weeks finding your way through the halls of Pandemonium.
Laura: I can't fucking believe that shit.
Marisha: Wait, we spend two weeks?
Sam: The halls of Pandemonium?
Matt: Yes, where his soul is currently encapsulated.
Sam: God, you asshole.
Marisha: In what?
Travis: What are the halls of Pandemonium?
Marisha: I should be mourning right now, and I'm hunting your stupid ass down!
Travis: I'm keeping you occupied. I really did this for you.
Matt: Pandemonium is a plane of madness  a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only at a maximum distance of ten feet. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment. So yeah, that's a fun time. It's a fun adventure you guys go on to retrieve Grog's soul.
Marisha: Great therapy lesson.
Travis: We'll one-shot it later. (laughter)
Marisha: A healing trip.
Sam: It's a good side quest for the future someday.
Matt: A good moment of, "Oh, we're not going to get a rest." Hopefully, we'll get Ashley back, but in the meantime, for the purposes of this, you come back two weeks after, extremely angry. Grog, as suddenly you're restored, and that tiny bead of light fades back, and you're not outside anymore. You're actually sitting in a reclined, cushioned couch or chair of some kind in Castle Whitestone, and all of your currently living friends are all around you, looking very angry.
Travis: Oh! It got me a chair.
Laura: You fucking idiot.
Travis: What?
Laura: I cannot believe you did that.
Travis: Did what?
Marisha: Keyleth backhands him with the hand that has the most rings on it, of power.
Travis: Do I lose any hit points?
Marisha: Probably not!
Travis: What? What happened?
Taliesin: You lost card privileges.
Sam: Yep. Hand them over.
Taliesin: Oh, we already took the whole deck.
Travis: Wait!
Sam: You may lose your belt for this, friend.
Laura: Yeah. You're lucky we didn't shave your beard. Yeah.
Travis: I fucked up.
Laura: You fucked up a lot.
Sam: Percy lost his arm rescuing you!
Travis: I'm sorry.
Taliesin: Are you?
Travis: No. (laughter)
Travis: All right. I just thought, it did fantastic things before! I don't know why it doesn't like me so much.
Taliesin: I don't think it was personal.
Travis: Are you sure?
Sam: You've learned a lesson that we had to pay for.
Travis: All right. Sorry, guys. Sorry, Pike.
Ashley: Hello? (laughter)
Matt: Look at that timing. I don't even know, man.
Sam: Pike, can you hear us?
Ashley: My internet crashed at the worst fucking time.
Marisha: We can't even see you right now. You're a silhouette on the screen, but we can hear you.
Matt: Pike, do you know what happened?
Sam: Yeah, I texted her the gist of what happened.
Ashley: Okay, so you disappeared?
Matt: Grog's soul was trapped somewhere on the plane of Pandemonium, and you guys had to take two weeks and battle your way through a terrible plane filled with wind and madness and creatures that were banished there to never escape, eventually battling some terrible beast that was guarding the gem that contained his soul, returned, and he just now woke up on the couch after restoring his consciousness to his body, and has been slapped in the face by Keyleth and told that he lost card privileges.
Travis: (tearfully) And Percy lost his arm!
Ashley: Oh no. Wait, what?!
Sam: Well, I may have been fibbing about that part.
Marisha: It might be a cheap joke.
Taliesin: I might have lost my arm or I might be hiding it behind my back. I'm not sure.
Travis: So news flash, pro tip  the cards may be dangerous.
Taliesin: That's good to know.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe we leave it alone, then.
Laura: Hey! Hi! Oh my god, that was craziness.
Sam: Nice. Any other things that we need to wrap up for the evening?
Taliesin: I pull a card from the deck.
Sam: No! I invoke the third contract.
Matt: I'll draw the card for you. Whichever one smashes Whitestone.
Taliesin: Suddenly, I lose everything.
Matt: Exactly. Oh my god, if you pull that card?
Taliesin: Wouldn't that be amazing?
Matt: Don't you even.
Laura: Penniless?
Matt: Everything he owns crumbles to dust.
Travis: Everything.
Matt: All material wealth.
Taliesin: It's why I don't pull cards!
Marisha: How fucked would that be? So fucked.
Sam: Bring it in.
Matt: After this unexpected side venture, you all say your goodbyes for the time being, scatter to the various business you have to. Pike? Is there anything else you wanted to do?
Ashley: Are we leaving?
Matt: Was there anything else this evening you needed to situate? I was going to begin to facilitate the epilogue.
Sam: What do you want to do?
Ashley: Can I grab Keyleth and Vex real quick?
Marisha: Yeah. Girl power.
Ashley: I'll take them to the little spot where I was in the woods.
Laura: Two weeks ago. (laughter)
Travis: Sorry.
Ashley: Okay. So hey, I put something together. It's dumb, but I made a bench and I put Vax's name on it and I didn't want to make him a headstone because that seems so final. Maybe he's still around somewhere.
Laura: He is.
Ashley: I also have these. I take out two of his feathers that I grabbed. And I thought you could put this with the feathers in your hair, Vex and Keyleth, you could do something with this.
Marisha: I think I have the perfect place for this. Thank you.
Laura: Thank you, Pike.
Marisha: Thank you so much.
Ashley: I'm sure you could make it look a little prettier than it is but--
Marisha: I think it's perfect.
Laura: It's absolutely perfect.
Marisha: Where are we going to put it?
Laura: Do you want it out in the woods?
Ashley: Maybe we should just leave it here.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: I think he'd like that.
Ashley: I think he would too.
Marisha: Something you have to stumble upon. It's a little hidden.
Laura: Yeah, it's stealthy!
Marisha: Stealthy memorial!
Ashley: Okay. I'll let you guys stay. I just wanted to do one more thing. Okay, I walk over to where Scanlan is.
Sam: You mean two weeks ago or are we after--
Matt: No, this is after the random, unexpected Pandemonium trip.
Ashley: Wait, is Grog on the trip or was that--
Matt: Well, no. You guys had to go there to find his soul.
Marisha: Grog was the reason for this season!
Travis: To be fair, nothing really happened in that mind.
Matt: That's true.
Ashley: Hey Scanlan!
Sam: Oi, Pike.
Ashley: How are you doing?
Sam: Now that Percy's arm has healed, I'm fine.
Ashley: Now that was bad, wasn't it?
Sam: Yeah. That bugbear came out of nowhere.
Ashley: The bugbear, you said?
Sam: Don't worry about it. I'm fine.
Ashley: I thought I forgot about that, maybe. Listen, I'm glad you're alive.
Sam: Me too. Thanks for saving us all in that big fight.
Ashley: Thank you for saving us all. I don't really have a whole lot to say, I care for you a lot and I wanted to let you know that.
Sam: I care for you, Pike. I've always loved you since the moment I met you and I'm so happy that we became friends as well.
Ashley: Me too.
Sam: Thank you for everything. Thank you for putting up with me when I was a shit and I hope that I've become more tolerable for you. After all that we've been through, I was wondering if I could ask you a question. I have a proposal for you, if you don't mind. Well, now that everything is safe again and back to normal, I was wondering if I could take you on a date. To a restaurant or something, then maybe if it goes well, we could go on another date and that's it.
Ashley: Well, I actually was going to ask you the same thing!
Sam: Well then. I'll let you do it! No, you do it! I don't want to-- I take it back! I don't ask you on a date!
Marisha: Oh.
Ashley: Oh no.
Sam: Oh no! The internet! Can you hear me, Ashley? (groaning)
Sam: Denied.
Taliesin: That was amazing!
Laura: That was a yes.
Matt: That was a yes.
Sam: That was a yes.
Marisha: It's 2017. When will we will have better Skype?
Taliesin: That's the most Scanlan thing I could have ever hoped for.
Matt: Remember, we're America. We have the worst Internet in the world. Weirdly. Net neutrality. As you guys gather, say your temporary goodbyes, knowing that you're all still very in touch with each other, knowing you care about each other, you begin to forge whatever life looks like outside of perpetual danger and the constant onslaught and struggle of terrors and heroic necessity. Scanlan.
Sam: Oh! Sorry, I'm having a text romance with Ashley Johnson right now.
Matt: Then I'll come back to you.
Sam: No. I'm ready. I can pull myself away from Pike for a second.
Matt: What does Scanlan do in the next year? Next five years, next ten years?
Sam: (clears throat) I have one prepared. Well, she's not here, so I don't know but I wrote down--
Ashley: Can you hear me at all?
Sam: Oh god, I love this!
Ashley: Sorry, my Internet keeps going out.
Travis: It's okay.
Laura: Perfect timing, Ash.
Matt: It's all right. So assuming that you guys went on a date. I'm discussing with Scanlan his epilogue. What does he wish to do in the next year, five and ten years?
Sam: My plan, what I wrote down, was find Kaylie, make sure she's okay. Help Pike repair Vasselheim or literally whatever she wants to do. Give all money to Kaylie except for my platinum bracelets with sapphires worth 2,500 gold that I send anonymously to Sybil to make sure she's taken care of. Long term, I would like to use my Wish/Teleport to check on Kaylie every now and then, at school or wherever she ends up.
Matt: She ends up at the Alabaster Lyceum in Emon, which is one of the highest places of learning. You have connections to the council and with the money that you've given her, she lords over many of the children of the various nobles.
Taliesin: I would have recommended my tutor, but of course, Vax slit his throat right about the time you met him. He was a good tutor before that.
Sam: I don't know but we'll wait until we get to Ashley to find out how things are going with our dating. Otherwise, in my free time, I would love to use my time to write down the epic stories of Vox Machina, from our meeting to saving the world and everything in between. It will be difficult as Scanlan is not an author, but he will rely on guidance from Ioun herself and may even ask Sprigg to be a copy-editor of sorts. The working title is "In the Belly of Dragons: The Legend of Scanlan Shorthalt and Vox Machina". Working title.
Travis: "In the Anus of Dragons," accurately.
Sam: And I hope to finish the book by the time I turn 71.
Travis: How old are you, exactly?
Sam: Oh, I'd be 70. When we started, I was 69.
Laura: You were that young?
Sam: Yeah.
Laura: You motherfucker!
Taliesin: You're full of shit.
Laura: Oh my god, I can't believe you were that young.
Travis: This whole time?
Laura: I thought you were 300 years old. Jesus.
Taliesin: Just full of shit.
Sam: I mean, that's about it. I think every once in a while, I would maybe try to see if I could see Vax or check in on him somehow, but I don't know how other than to scry.
Matt: Which does not succeed, but you still send your thoughts and wishes into the ether in hopes that they find their way there. Okay.
Matt: So following off that, the story of Taryon Darrington, which I have something written for here based off what he did. Feel free to embellish or change how you see fit. As the months pass, the Darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more humble lifestyle, and their work of charity within the city of Deastok and the neighboring lands goes far to clean up the family name from where it once was. While their influence was greatly diminished and they're essentially a political laughingstock, the message of their work still strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic lords to the north and an alliance is made that protects the Darrington name and interests from the Myriad's ever wiley grasp for the time being. Doty 3.0 now stands a shining golden color, gifted the materials by a thankful ore baron whom Taryon's Brigade of Adventurers saved from a terrifying doppelgänger's plot. His troupe continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the southern lands of the Dwendalian Empire, some good, some humorous. His mother, Mariya, ever cheering them on and making their tabards for years before passing away peacefully, proud of her boy. Her passing brings the rest of the family closer together than it's ever been. And the charitable efforts, surprisingly, of Howaardt now encompass the Darrington Brigade as a non-profit adventuring league. During a gambling run in Port Demali to follow, Taryon stumbles upon a now slightly more haggard Lawrence, now working as a tanner. They immediately fell right back where they left off and Lawrence cashed in his life as a leather worker to join the Brigade alongside Taryon.
Laura: Oh! That's so great!
Sam: I love it!
Matt: Anything you wish to add to that?
Sam: No, I had written a letter, but yours is much better. Yeah, that's great.
Laura: You wrote a letter?
Sam: I didn't know how much Matt was going to put.
Matt: You could still read the letter.
Sam: I can read the end of the letter.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh, Sam.
Sam: No, it's fine. You did good.
Matt: I didn't mean to step on anything you did.
Sam: No, you did great. Much better.
Matt: Pike. Wilhand spends his twilight years helping with small tasks around the emerging House of the Everlight as it is built on the northern edge of Westruun before age finally takes him in peace amongst friends and family. The red-brick house you grew up in and Grog grew along with you for a while is left in your name and there you know you have ever a homestead in Westruun in memory of Wilhand and the friendships you forged. What else would you like to do? What else do you wish to achieve, Pike, as the years go on? That could pertain to you and whatever relationship with Scanlan you wish to embellish on.
Sam: Should we roll for dating? (laughter)
Matt: There's a chart somewhere in second edition.
Ashley: I don't know what Grog's plans are, but I do know if there were any adventuring to be had, that her and Grog got to on some adventures together.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: And that he always has a place in my home and I know I would love to-- I'm sure at this point, fully rebuild the temple in Vasselheim. I think things have gone well with Scanlan. Oh man, I'm getting so emotional.
Sam: Like second-base well or even better than that?
Ashley: Well, I think if we spend enough time together, maybe, I don't know, can we see what else life has for us together?
Sam: Absolutely.
Ashley: That doesn't have to mean anything more. I know your life, what you like to do and I'll give you freedom.
Sam: No, I think the most free I've ever been is with you.
Ashley: I think there's no one I would rather spend the rest of my days with, besides my pal Grog. I think you get a two-for-one deal!
Sam: Sure. The weird family dynamic.
Travis: You guys keep it quiet up there, please?
Sam: Weird roommates. Giant lower floor, tiny upper floor.
Liam: The ceiling is one inch above your head.
Ashley: I think at some point, I ask Scanlan for his hand in marriage.
Sam: I mean, I would have to ask Wilhand for his permission.
Matt: He passed away.
Sam: Well then, I would go leave some flowers at the grave.
Travis: You can ask me.
Sam: Oh, I will ask Grog for permission. Grog, as the father figure in our weird household, I would like to ask for your permission to wed your not-daughter, Pike, who is much smarter and older than you.
Travis: You're a scoundrel. Do you have any money?
Sam: I have this little black rock that you gave me.
Travis: That's worth literally nothing. How about you give her this? And I take out the rare black sapphire and put it in your hand.
Sam: That's pretty good.
Travis: I'm fucking watching you, you understand?
Sam: I won't hurt her, I promise.
Travis: Don't you slip up!
Sam: Nope, I know you could kill me in my sleep.
Travis: I know. I usually put dead people in the bag of holding, but there's always a first! Treat her right.
Sam: Would you walk me down the aisle and by walk me down the aisle, I mean carry me down the aisle? (laughter)
Travis: (high-pitched) Yes.
Sam: All right, let's have a group weird hug.
Matt: Aw. All righty. Anything else, Pike? Are you happy with that?
Sam: Do I have to convert, Pike?
Ashley: What's that?
Sam: Do I have to convert? I'm an Iounian.
Ashley: No.
Sam: Okay, I'm good.
Laura: You're Iounish?
Ashley: Sarenrae's very accepting of other gods.
Sam: Multi-faith ceremony. There you go.
Marisha: 16 rites of passage.
Matt: Anything else, Pike?
Ashley: No.
Matt: Okay. All right, we'll leave it at that. Percival. Vex'ahlia. Since your fates are rather intertwined, I ask you both what are your plans, what are your plots?
Taliesin: I don't really think we should settle down. That seems like a lot.
Laura: (laughs)
Taliesin: I think that I would like to start a very complicated art project that's going to take many years. I'm not going to work on it all the time, day and night, but I'm going to invest some time in this.
Laura: Are you going to be in your shop a lot?
Taliesin: No, I'm going to build a clocktower. Like the one in Prague. I'm going to take many years and it's going to sit at the front of the castle so it will be outside and there will be other people working on it. It will, as a proper clock does, it will tell our story. Once a year, everything will play out.
Laura: Holy shit. That's good.
Taliesin: And we may start inviting tinkering artisans every year for Whitestone to come show off things that are not necessarily useful, but to show off fanciful inventions and things that are beautiful.
Laura: I love that idea.
Taliesin: But let's not stay here too often. (laughter)
Laura: No, although we will have to stay here for nine months every once in a while, because I think we should rebuild the families that we've lost.
Taliesin: There's a lot of names.
Laura: So many names.
Taliesin: So many names.
Matt: How many names?
Taliesin: So many ways to irritate your father.
Laura: Five names.
Taliesin: Oh, at the very least.
Laura: Five.
Marisha: That's a lot of names. Very long names.
Liam: At least three sets of twins. (laughter)
Taliesin: Jesus.
Laura: I definitely want to build a statue to Trinket, the wonder bear.
Marisha: The wonder bear.
Sam: Is he dead?
Laura: No, Trinket's around.
Sam: Damn it.
Laura: So centuries of people in Whitestone will remember their mascot, Trinket.
Marisha: He prevents forest fires. (laughter)
Travis: Ranger's hat.
Laura: As the years pass, we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere.
Taliesin: There will be. Bears will be involved in the festival. Obviously. Especially since the clock tower is part of the festival and bears feature heavily in it.
Laura: Perfect.
Travis: Only you can prevent forest fires.
Taliesin: Only you can prevent the rise of Vecna. (laughter)
Laura: I was hoping to never stop attempting to contact Vax through the temple of the Raven Queen.
Matt: You do notice that the raven population of Whitestone seems to be perpetually seeing blooms every year, far more than it used to.
Laura: I cast Speak with Animals on them and I constantly try to communicate with him.
Matt: Okay, I mean they all seem to be ravens happy to live in this space, but it seems to be more in essence the vicinity more than a specific raven.
Laura: Would you be all right if we increased the Pelor temple here?
Taliesin: Yes, I trust your judgment. It is not for me, but I'm definitely all right with anything that makes you happy.
Laura: Thank you, darling.
Taliesin: To be fair, you'd do it anyway.
Laura: Pretty much, yeah.
Taliesin: I help Cassandra as best I can. I think at least once a year we get out and do something irresponsible.
Laura: Definitely.
Taliesin: Maybe sometimes drag these kids out for shenanigans.
Matt: Cassandra, as a note by the way. She's had a few pretty difficult brushes with death and the experiences definitely left a mark on her. Within the year following the battle with Vecna, she begins to remind you of yourself at a very dark time. Recognizing that, you come to her and help pull her from a dangerous edge of lashing out at the place she's worked so hard to build. You help her realize that this guilt she's been holding as being a tool of manipulation the times that she has been is not her fault and used against the ones she loves. In that determination to no longer be a tool for others to use, she asks Vex to teach her and train her. To not just be the lady beacon of Whitestone, but also join in as one of its protectors.
Laura: At least she had some good promise a long time ago.
Matt: "That was some time, but I've seen what you can do and, well, I deign to think of how dangerous the three of us would be if I could reach your level."
Laura: We'll make you strong, darling.
Taliesin: We also insist that she leave Whitestone at least once a year for a period of time to do fuck all.
Laura: Yeah, there's a beautiful place called Dalen's Closet. I think you would love it.
Taliesin: Let's not, well yes, there's, well.
Matt: Anything else? You guys happy with that?
Taliesin: I'm content to make a clock tower and make art and never make another weapon. I'm good.
Matt: Hmm, all right.
Laura: I have "Make Whitestone the tits," written in my notes of things that I want to do.
Taliesin: It's got a bear. I'm imagining the bear from Burning Man actually.
Marisha: Penny Bear.
Laura: Yeah, Penny Bear. I like it.
Matt: There you go. Grog.
Travis: I'm so fascinated by Vasselheim. I have so many interests that I feel it only proper to go back and turn myself in to the authorities for punching one of the guards in the face and take whatever punishment they have for me.
Matt: All right, as you head back to the district in which these incursions happened, you are immediately recognized and much to their completely taken aback reaction they bring you in until somebody of the higher Bastions goes, "You fools. This is one of Vox Machina. What's wrong with you?" "Oh I didn't--" And they all point up at the large titan which is--
Travis: Yeah, up top, that's where we were.
Matt: Which currently has been cleared out of any cursed undead that they know of. It's a process that takes a while, but it becomes a monument to that battle and it becomes converted into a symbol of hope for the city. For generations to come in Vasselheim, that titan will stand there, lording over the city, as a reminder of what transpired, of what could have been lost, and what was saved that day in memory of those that were lost. And as you point up to that and they all realize, they slowly remove your shackles.
Travis: Oh, I'm free to go?
Matt: "Yes, sir. Thank you, thank you."
Travis: That's unexpected. Could you point me in the direction of a library?
Matt: "Sure, come with me." As you begin to walk out you watch as a familiar figure steps up to this portion of the Bastions' guard post, you see a familiar merchant who rushes up and goes, "I was being summoned. They found the-- why's he walking free?"
Travis: Yes. You. You will come with me.
Matt: "Gentlemen, this is the man who punched me. This is the man who ruined my business. I can--"
Travis: Gentlemen, whose word are you going to take? The savior of Vasselheim, or his new tutor?
Matt: "What?" (laughter)
Matt: The guards go, "Cobalt Reserve library station is down that way to the left. Hard to miss, big blue dome. You two work this out." And they retract back into the guard post, leaving the two of you in the street.
Travis: Well, unless you have something better to do, you could contribute to one of the greatest people to ever pass through this city and help me learn to read a little bit more. Would that be a problem? I only have 8,000 gold to give you.
Matt: Make a persuasion check with advantage.
Sam: 8,000 gold.
Travis: Natural 20. (cheering)
Matt: (laughter) Didn't even need the advantage. All right.
Sam: 8,000 gold.
Matt: "Well, that would certainly go far for reparations for the damage you've caused to both my business, my person and my psyche." (laughter)
Matt: "But I'm curious to see what this change of heart is, so sure. But you're going to pay upfront."
Travis: Yes, 8,000 gold.
Matt: "Holy shit."
Travis: I could carry it if you want.
Matt: "We'll just make a quick stop over by my shop, please."
Travis: Fair enough.
Matt: And he drags it and it leaves this big heavy groove in the ground as he pulls it along. "Nope, nope, it's good, I got it" (struggling noises) And leads you to the Cobalt Reserve and for as long as you'll have him he'll begin to tutor you.
Travis: I'd like to learn to read a bit more. I'd like to split some time in the temple of Kord.
Matt: Which takes a while to get rebuilt and you probably help out a bit, too, Earthbreaker Groon, who survived, though many of his--
Travis: Oh, he did survive.
Matt: He did survive, yeah. He's made of hardier stuff.
Travis: I'd also like to bring Pike out every once in a while and we give challengers a shot in the Crucible, but mostly I'm trying to improve my mind and looking for the next challenge.
Matt: I like it.
Liam: Bring him up to eight intelligence.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: Seven's a good start. (laughter)
Matt: Perfect. Happy with that?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, then. Keyleth.
Marisha: (sighs) Okay. Naturally, help Pike rebuild Vasselheim in the most immediate of circumstances. Eventually retire to Zephra. Go be the actual leader of my people. Continue to get in any type of frays that these people invite me on as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my promise to protect this realm any time this realm needs protecting. And I find Kerrick at some point. Seek out Kerrick. Make sure he's okay. Reconnect with him, have coffee, you know.
Matt: Yeah. He's a quick jaunt from Zephra, thankfully. Westruun's not that far. That's one of the closer large cities outside of Stillben.
Marisha: Perfect. We're weekend buddies.
Matt: (laughs)
Marisha: We go to wine country. And then I work on the propagated sprig from the Sun Tree and continue to build it out, hopefully on the ley lines of the planet, and I take the feather that Pike gave me from Vax and I embed it into the trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from the Raven Queen I can find. Care for ravens as much as I can.
Matt: There is an uptick of ravens in the space of Zephra as well. Not many, but more than there would be, which is usually zero.
Marisha: And from the branch of the Sun Tree create my own raven tree of the Ashari. Take a long, long, long, long, long time before I maybe date again. Maybe. But eventually, hopefully, after a long, long, long, long, long time sunset into the tree and become a part of this realm.
Matt: That's a ways off for you, Ms. Archdruid.
Marisha: Ways off.
Matt: But you begin those preparations.
Marisha: But that's the plan.
Matt: Okay. Well you, Keyleth, who many only once saw the naive druid girl have a level of respect now that's carried with that mantle that you hold. And the council of Tal'Dorei occasionally calls upon your wisdom and guidance. The alliance between the civilised and the natured world of the lands irrevocably in Tal'Dorei bound to you at this point, between you and the earth Ashari who reside up in the Cliffkeep. Between occasional jaunts to Emon and Whitestone, you find renewed joy in the protection of the people there. One cold Cuersaar the 13th, the tenth month of the year, the cool summer dusk day closes and you emerge from the quarters to find that the winds come and blow through your hair. You step out to the sound of children laughing as a dozen Ashari kids, elf, dwarf, orc, many bloods and creeds rush past as they play. It's a familiar sound. It's a happy sound. You glance over at this village you're protecting and the people that truly look up to you as their leader, both not just from a might source but as a guide. And you look to them to teach you things every day as well. Looking past as the sun begins to set, you see Korrin standing by the cherry blossom at the edge of the cliff near the amphitheatre where you had your ceremony. In pinks and oranges and purples, the sunset takes the sky. As you approach, he still looks out. He's older, not too much older but older. As he notices you approach, he looks over. "In all my years, not a day passes where awe does not strike me at the beauty of this world." He looks over towards the sunset. "Don't ever lose the memory of every face whose strength helped you keep this light from fading. Every single face."
Marisha: I don't think it's the faces that keep this light from fading. I think it is what it is. We're lucky to experience it, a few are lucky to think it's beautiful. You taught me that. I don't have to appreciate this. Especially not after what I've seen. But I do.
Matt: "You need to."
Marisha: Only because of what I've seen.
Matt: And you see a bit of heartbreak but he nods his head and reaches out and takes you in, holds you there on the cliff side, the winds just being kept at bay. "I'm proud of you."
Marisha: Thank you. It's all I ever wanted. It's weird, once you reach a life goal and then realize you have the rest of your life. I guess I just find new goals. Sometimes it's hard being a prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult.
Matt: He pulls you in tighter. "You'll always be my girl. My little Keyleth."
Marisha: Thanks, Dad.
Matt: "I love you."
Marisha: I love you.
Matt: (sighs) "Anyway, I should get to seeing if dinner preparations are being made. Looks to be a cold night." He tugs your hand and walks back, leaves you there on the cliff side looking out. As the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon, leaving you with the purples and blues of the night sky as the stars begin to glitter up, you can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree. There's just one raven.
Marisha: Blow a kiss.
Matt: Flies down, lands on your shoulder. It's a bigger raven than any you've seen before. You've not seen this raven around.
Marisha: Little scratch.
Matt: It leans into it. And every day that raven comes to visit. And that's where we're going to close the campaign.
Sam: What a nice story.
Laura: Wow.
Travis: Let's do it again. (laughter)
Taliesin: Oh my god.
Matt: Oh, wow. When this chapter closes, a whole new one, a whole new one opens very soon. (sighs) We'll be back in the new year with a new story to tell and in the meantime we'll be playing games here and mixing it up. Being silly. A few other faces are going to take up the storytelling mantle here. Me and Marisha have a wedding in a little over a week.
Marisha: Oh god. I had to get past this emotional chapter so I could get through the next one. (laughter)
Matt: But here we are at the end of this near-five-year journey for us and near-three-year journey with all of you and I just want to appreciate having, honestly, some of the best friends and players I could ever hope for to come along on this journey, to trust me enough to build this with you and to give back so much more than I could have ever hoped.
Liam: Thank you, Matt.
Laura: Thank you.
Marisha: Best DM ever.
Matt: You guys make it all easy and worthwhile.
Laura: Oh fuck.
Matt: Love you guys.
Laura: Shit. Yay!
Matt: And love you guys, each and every one of you out there who've come with us on this journey; new, old, for just a bit, or the entire length, some of you multiple times. Thank you for joining in on whatever this weird little magical, curious experience has, and will continue to be. Promise me you'll be good.
Marisha: We'll be back.
Laura: Yeah, we'll be back.
Liam: We might look a little different, but we're still going to be here.
Matt: Yep!
Laura: That was a really pretty sendoff, Matt. Thank you.
Marisha: That was beautiful.
Sam: Thanks, Matt. That was really nice.
Matt: Love you, guys.
Laura: Love you, Matthew.
Matt: Love you, guys. Have a wonderful night. Rest well. And is it Thursday yet?
