[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello everyone, welcome to the fifth episode of Critical Role! Before we start and get into the videos for our initial intro, let me go over a couple of things for the evening. First off, we're shooting to get to 1,500 subscribers by this evening, and as soon as we get there, we're giving out a promo kit that's worth about $250, which is awesome. We'll all go ahead and sign it at the end of the day and get it out to you as well. Also, Tabletop Day is coming up this Saturday, and a few of us will be showing up during the stream as well and any of you guys playing your own tabletop games at home, or whatever the case may be, if you go to the website and register, for each person that registers, we're giving away a boardgame to the charity Big Brothers and Big Sisters, so that's a really, really cool thing that you guys should get involved with. That's this Saturday, at International Tabletop Day, and also, we received a present apparently from the audience.
Travis: A present?
Matt: That I get to open.
Liam: Vat eez zis present? [static]
Matt: I don't know vat zis present eez, but now I get to open zis.
All: Ooh!
Matt: This is for all of us, apparently.
Taliesin: What kind of sack is that?
Matt: It is a big-- oh, it is a gigantic sack.
Orion: Ooh, I love gigantic sacks
Matt: Oh my god guys, this is, this is amazing!
Laura: There's a card on it.
Matt: All right.
Laura: On the other side.
Matt: There's a card? Oh snap. By the power of #TeamNoStream, you have the power. By Negihama, thank you Negihama.
All: Thank you Negihama!
Matt: That's amazing, as we now have for the group, a castle Greyskull.
All: Huzzah! Yay!
Matt: So during the intro break we're going to go ahead and open this and find a place for it nearby, 'cause this is now representative of the keep that the players have waiting for them at Emon once they get out of this horrible mess. Anyway guys, welcome to Critical Role, let's get into those intros, shall we?
Ashley: Pike grew up in the outskirts of town, near the Bramblewood. Her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation. Thievery, destruction, and trickery left them with the curse of the last name of Trickfoot. Sarenrae, the goddess of healing and redemption, had other plans for Pike's great-great-grandfather Wilhand, who left his family at a young age after a dream-- a dream that changed the course of the Trickfoot family. Wilhand devoted his life to Sarenrae, and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion. As a child, Pike seemed to have an affinity to heal. Whether it was animals, people, or even flowers, she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken. She studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic. She lived a peaceful life, quiet and simple, until one day, Wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians. One of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome, and he himself was beaten, bloodied, and left for dead, abandoned by his herd. Wilhand went to Pike for help. She prayed, and healed this barbarian as best she could, bringing him back to life. When he awoke, she discovered his name was Grog Strongjaw. After that, they were the best of friends, a rather unlikely pair. Little did she know that in a few years' time, Grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from the clutches of death. After being killed in battle, Pike felt angry. She wanted to be stronger, so that it would never happen again. She spent four months at sea, training with the men and women aboard a ship called The Broken Howl. Gripping her holy symbol in one hand, and her morningstar in the other, this time, Pike is ready.
Travis: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw. A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale. Wait. Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things. Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this terrified little thing. His disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader, his uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale.
Marisha: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions. Under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants. Literally. Born to the Air tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts. Which I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korren, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself. Not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: is she even worthy?
Taliesin: Percy was the third of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north, in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attentions to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream. A roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun. (gunshot)
Sam: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day, he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe, where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.
Orion: Greetings and salutations. I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Ty'rex, located in the heart of Draconia, born from a politically respected family. At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian High Council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the Magic Guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the High Council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms, going from town to town and making friends and allies, in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.
Liam: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn, but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.
Laura: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. And through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear, her own stolen Trinket, to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable and gives expert massages.
Matt: Welcome back, guys. So we finally have Pike's video finished, so I hope you got to enjoy that. As a heads-up, too, unfortunately we're going to be down one Scanlan due to work, but that's okay, the bard will be in our hearts this evening, and you're welcome to tweet at him angrily to make sure he makes the next session.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: So, without further ado, let's go and kick into the recap. So, the party has initially been sent down on a mission by the arcanist Allura Vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has gone missing, named Lady Kima of Vord. A folk hero and a very respected individual, she went on a vision quest and apparently went alone into Kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that was festering beneath the city, and hasn't been seen for weeks and weeks. The party was hired by her to go and try to find her whereabouts and hopefully bring her back safely. Since traversing and meeting individuals in Kraghammer, they then spearheaded into the Greyspine Mines where apparently these monstrosities have been burbling out time and time again over the past few weeks. Pushing down, they had encountered umber hulks, they managed to inquire some duergar, which, apparently there's a lot of them down here. Duergar being an ashy-skinned, subterranean dark, evil dwarf-type offshoot. One of which had with it a brain-type quadruped that managed to Brain Spike Grog and send him catatonic for a short time. They, wandering through the caverns, discovered there was a duergar war camp across the way from-- across this large chasm that was currently being run by a general duergar alongside what appeared to be, and what they've now discovered to be, a mind flayer or an illithid. They managed to, upon looking deeper into this cavern, finding hidden behind a waterfall, thanks to the druid and the ranger, completely stealing from the rest of the group their flying carpet, made a very tenuous relationship and alignment with another mind flayer, apparently cast out of his own society, searching to find a way to both get revenge and find his way back into his colony of people. And his name was Clarota, lovingly called Clarence by the group, probably much to his own chagrin. After which they decided to go ahead and try to extract information from this duergar general, and stop this war camp from preparing itself for battle and attack, seemingly, on Kraghammer in the near future. Through a strange, crazy plan they came up with, they managed to fly undetected over via flying carpet and eagle, and floating sorcerer, over the entire war camp, made a Metal Gear run into the center of their main barracks-- (all laugh)
Matt: -- threw a bucket of goblin shit into the face of the one mind flayer--
Ashley: Whoops.
Matt: -- after which, Vax bisected it, pretty much, in one surprise round of attacks that led to a large battle in the center of this building, partway through which ground began to rumble. And then digging a forth from underneath, a bulette, a gargantuan armored, burrowing creature that was hungry and very dangerous that then made the battle that much more intense. A heavy, blood-filled battle later, involved with Percy getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet of the beast, eventually it had its armor pulled apart and was defeated by the party. The remnants of the duergar army inside of this building have been destroyed, aside from a few stragglers who have laid their weapons down, and the general now lies beaten, on his knees before the rest of the party. And that is where we pick up and begin. So, as you all are catching your breath, breathing heavily, as the adrenaline slowly leaves the system. Looking around this building, with the large hole still glaring through the roof.
Orion: I'm waving through it.
Matt: Tiberius is waving through it.
Laura: Oh, you're still up top.
Matt: The general's on the ground, warhammer at his side, blackened armor still kind of sizzling with the arcane energy from his temporary Banishment via Scanlan. He sits there with this kind of gnarled, brackish beard, looking about the rest of you with these wild kind of white-coated eyes. "So you found your way in. What's your purpose? What do you want from me?"
Liam: Well, Vax walks right up to him and walks behind him and grabs him by the hair, and right back to this position. Let's have a talk.
Laura: Oh.
Liam: Would you care to have a chat?
Laura: Of course I would, thank you.
Matt: "If you want blood, take it. It's all you're getting from me."
Travis: Okay, kill him.
All: No, wait!
Orion: Hold on a second, ask the question.
Laura: We don't want your blood.
Orion: What are we asking?
Laura: We're looking for a halfling. Have you seen one?
Matt: "I don't know what you're talking about."
Laura: A female halfling. She came down here.
Matt: "Well, she wouldn't have gotten far if she did. Not with my people."
Liam: I take my dagger and stick it in about a centimeter and say, your master is gone, it's just you and your friends here now, I think it's in your best interest to talk. You could walk away from here. You don't have to die if you can play nicely.
Orion: And believe me when I tell you he usually kills everybody. He doesn't give that offer very often. (all laugh)
Matt: Go ahead and make an intimidation roll with advantage.
Travis: First roll of the night. First roll of the night.
Orion: Yeah!
Liam: Natural 20! (all laugh and cheer)
Matt: That's a way to start.
Marisha: The first one tonight!
Laura: That's the way!
Travis: Probably those eight miles you rode.
Orion: Shush!
Matt: As you pull the blade to his throat, he chuckles deeply against the strain. "Your halfling lass was foolish. We took her. We delivered her to King Murghol as a present. If she lives, she's probably ruined and broken deep within the dungeons of Emberhold. You're welcome to go for her there."
Liam: Who's this king of yours?
Laura: King what?
Marisha: Murgholt?
Matt: "Murghol."
Orion: Which way should we head?
Matt: "Ooh, down, probably."
Orion: I mean, is there any particular shortcuts or less running into your kind along the way, I suppose?
Matt: "I highly doubt it." He spits in your direction.
Orion: Oh! Prestidigitation. And I catch it and throw it back into his face.
Marisha: Can I do an insight check to see if he's lying about that?
Matt: Go for it.
Taliesin: I think we have some prisoners to free or something as well.
Laura: Yes.
Marisha: 22.
Matt: He does not appear to be lying about his interpretation of her, apparently she is where he is. As to where her current state is, you don't know, but he seems to have a very, very made-up mind as to her possibility of her being alive still.
Marisha: What about a secret path that we can maybe get through to avoid some of these people? Was kind of wondering if he's lying.
Matt: You can press him that information even harder.
Marisha: Hey guys, we should press him for information about this passage.
Liam: Just a couple of more questions.
Laura: Can I start speaking to him in Underdark?
Matt: Of course.
Laura: And I ask him--
Marisha: That's hot.
Laura: Yep, it's an awesome language. Tell me about the hidden passages. I know there are some. I am good tonight, you guys
Travis: What does Underdark sound like, by the way? (all laugh)
Laura: It sounds kind of like--
Taliesin: Parseltongue?
Liam: It's like Pig Latin.
Laura: (speaking Undercommon)
Travis: Mm, no!
Liam: Ere-way are the idden-hay assages-pay?
Matt: It's kind of reminiscent of Black Speech from the Tolkien universe, that has that guttural (speaking Black Speech) very, very deep.
Laura: Oh right, that.
All: (speaking Black Speech)
Matt: A little bit like a whispering darkness to it. As she speaks this tongue, it catches a lot of you off guard, you've not heard her use this tongue until this point. Make an intimidation check.
Ashley: (gasps) Vex, what are you doing? What is this coming out of your mouth?
Travis: That sounds real pretty.
Laura: Right, I have my papers.
Matt: Get your sheet ready.
Laura: Oh noes, hold on, hold on.
Matt: You got your paper today? Lovely.
Liam: She's bonafide.
Laura: 18.
Matt: 18. He says, "No passages to the stronghold, but there is a way in. Aside from the front. Good luck getting up in there from that point."
Ashley: Is it through the lake?
Matt: "Yes, through the lake. Deep below, you'll find a tunnel. This tunnel will lead you to a subterranean passage straight to the stronghold."
Laura: Can we check to make sure he's not untruthful?
Matt: Make an insight.
Laura: (groans) Okay. 16?
Matt: No, he's bullshitting through his teeth.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Liam: Vex'ahlia?
Matt: Hey, he seemed honest about the passage but dishonest about the-- he's basically following her lead. "Uh-huh."
Laura: You're lying.
Matt: "Perhaps."
Laura: Tell us true, where is it?
Matt: "If I tell you, will you let me live?"
Travis: Ooh. Well.
Taliesin: I think that's very reasonable.
Laura: I think that's reasonable. We'll--
Matt: "I'm essentially--"
Taliesin: We will not kill you.
Laura: I think we can--
Travis: We can lock him up. And then kill him.
Liam: We'll leave you alive.
Laura: We'll leave you alive.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: "Don't just leave me alive. Give me a chance to walk from this building, on my own, arms intact."
Travis: No.
Matt: "And I'll give you the secret entrance to Emberhold itself, leading you straight within the throne room."
Orion: Well, that's a good thing.
Taliesin: So we have to leave you alive, and let you leave this building intact?
Matt: "Correct."
Travis: I go over and pick up his warhammer and say, you may-- maybe-- leave. But I get to keep this as a souvenir.
Taliesin: I actually think this is an appropriate moment to play with a bit of banditry. I say we take everything from him and he can make his way out all on his own.
Travis: I like that idea.
Laura: Yeah--
Marisha: Ooh, that's fun.
Laura: -- all his clothes, everything.
Travis: Butt naked.
Liam: And you can advise--
Marisha: Wait, wait, hang on.
Orion: As is his undergarments on for--
Travis: Why?
Orion: I don't care to see that.
Marisha: Why don't we take him with us? Just in casies--
Matt: At which point, a cold, clammy hand touches your shoulder and pulls you aside as--
Marisha: Ew.
Matt: -- a partially hooded Clarota steps forward and says, "I'll attempt to read his surface thoughts. If he tries to keep it from me, I'll know."
Travis: Smart, smart!
Matt: As he steps forward, he puts one hand in front of him and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue. You can see the general tips his head back for a second and begins twitching an eye. Sweat begins to bead around his brow as Clarota takes another step forward, tensing his hand once more, his head beginning to bow forward with an intensity, a force of focus towards his direction. You can now see the general, "Let me live. Let me go and I'll tell you. This isn't necessary. I'm willing to give you the information." You can see a trickle of blood begin to pour out of one of his nostrils.
Travis: Yeah.
Orion: That's a mind flayer.
Laura: What do we do? I think we should stop him. Should we stop him?
Liam: Clarota.
Laura: Wait.
Liam: Does he know anything about K'varn?
Matt: "Let me see." And the mind flayer pushes once more into his brain. You see a twitch to his face as his head kind of lolls back and rolls for a second, resisting as best he can. But his will is currently being beaten by the defeat of the battle, the lack of his compatriot mind flayer, and the sheer intensity of Clarota now focused on vengeance and returning to his people. The blood beings to stream not just from his nostrils, but from his ears as well. As Clarota releases him for a second, he goes, "He has not seen K'varn, but knows a bit of his nature. I cannot read it, but we could press for more information."
Liam: I walk up--
Laura: I think we should just ask him.
Liam: -- next to Clarota, push the dwarf against the wall, and say, our friend here is not as patient as I am. We want to know about this K'varn, and we want you and all your men, all your little mates here, to throw your weapons into the chasm, you can go fuck off, but we want to know everything. And this is your last chance. Right now, right here. Talk.
Travis: And you have to get naked.
Laura: (whispers) And you have to get naked.
Liam: That's correct.
Orion: Will you stop with the naked? Grog--
Travis: What?
Taliesin: I'm with you on that.
Travis: Thank you.
Ashley: Yeah, me too.
Marisha: It's starting to become a thing now. I'm just saying.
Matt: "K'varn was responsible for forging the alliance. For centuries and generations, his people and mine killed and fought. It wasn't until K'varn came that we decided to work together for a common cause. Expansion, unification, dominion over this land and these mountains. Divided, we were weak, petty, greedy. With K'varn leading us, we have purpose, we have growth. We could take what we'd like, and I'm but one dwarf. If I fall over here, many more will take over where I fell."
Taliesin: Well, we can see that's obviously worked out really well for you. I think that I'm satisfied, are you satisfied?
Laura: What kind of creature is K'varn?
Liam: What is K'varn?
Matt: "I have not seen K'varn personally."
Laura: But you've heard rumors, though?
Matt: "What I know of K'varn-- a being of immense intelligence. A creature that needs not walk this earth, one that does not touch the land that it traverses. I know it sees all, it smiles from a toothy maw and laughs, laughs in the darkness. Protruding from its forehead, one nasty, gnarled black horn, terrible source of its dark power. That is what's beneath here."
Laura: Is he telling the truth?
Matt: Insight check.
Liam: Insight check for me as well.
Taliesin: Would I recognize this creature he's describing?
Matt: Go ahead and make a nature check. Or arcana, either one.
Marisha: Can I assist him?
Taliesin: Or arcana? 14.
Marisha: Can I do a nature check?
Matt: This'll be more for your own personal knowledge, probably not. But you can make one yourself.
Marisha: Well, that's what I'm saying.
Taliesin: 14.
Marisha: 'Cause you're doing arcana?
Taliesin: I did arcana.
Orion: A d20 roll.
Marisha: I'm doing nature. 29, nature.
Matt: All right, so. No natural creature you've ever heard has this type of essence to it, having a single black horn.
Liam: It's clearly a narwhal.
Matt: It is.
Liam: It's a sentient narwhal.
Matt: It's an awful, awful narwhal. Way to spoil the story, Liam.
Marisha: Demon narwhal.
Ashley: (singsong) Well, maybe we should go.
Matt: Gnashing teeth, black horn, very intelligent. That doesn't seem to be anything from nature itself. From your experience, there are different entities, but usually there are multiple horns. Singular, demonic beings that would have extreme intelligence, sharp teeth, horns, and you've had brief brushes in the past with demonic entities that seems to run in a similar vein, but nothing in particular is creeping into mind. It's going to be difficult for you to specifically come up with this, with what little information you currently have. Yeah.
Orion: Well, I'm satisfied.
Liam: I am, too.
Laura: Maybe we should let him go.
Liam: Why don't you strip?
Orion: I agree.
Travis: Do you wanna handcuff him?
Ashley: Take off your clothes!
Laura: Yeah, let's take his-- We take Grog's handcuffs out of his bag.
Matt: "Let me-- That was not the deal! You leave me, unspoiled, on my life, and I tell you the way into Emberhold."
Laura: Well, tell us!
Orion: Take the hammer. That's rough on him. Leave his armor on.
Laura: You haven't told us yet, have you?
Liam: We already told you your weapons are ours.
Taliesin: In fact, we'll be keeping your weapons, your armor, and I believe, your pride.
Marisha: Yes.
Laura: But your life is yours.
Taliesin: You may even outrun the dwarves we're about to set free.
Orion: Oh good, yeah.
Travis: Oh good, yeah.
Travis: Nice! Percy's fucked-up tonight, I like it.
Taliesin: I'm in a mood.
Matt: "Emberhold."
Liam: He tried to make a book out of someone's flesh once.
Laura: Wait, wait. He's telling us, shut up.
Liam: Yes, sorry.
Matt: "Emberhold is the fortress of our people, built to resist assault from all sides."
Liam: Shite.
Matt: "We've an army, hiding about the outskirts of it. Kind of like an army you might have in one of yours, if you think you have a chance. However, since I don't think that's what you carry, your best bet is on the left side of the fortress. There are two streams of molten rock that pour down the side. The smaller of those two streams covers a secret tunnel."
Liam: Insight check. Is he full of shit? I rolled-- Oh, nothing too hot at all. Never mind, forget it. Forget I said anything.
Matt: All right. He seems to be forthright and honest with his information. "However, that'll take you through the lava. That's up to you. It's meant to open from the inside. A trapdoor-like mechanism that spreads the actual flow. From the outside, well, good luck. I've done my side of the bargain. Let me free."
Liam: Stepping behind, I take my knife, and I cut his belt loose and let his pants fall, and I give him a little nudge.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: You're free to go. Not toward your stronghold, but towards the surface.
Matt: So his belt falls, changepurse, and everything. He is wearing full plate black armor--
Liam: Sure.
Matt: So his trousers do not plummet.
Liam: Aw, that's a shame.
Travis: Can't we have Scanlan turn him into a porpoise?
Matt: He picks up his warhammer.
Travis: I don't think so. No, that's mine. As a token to remember you by.
Matt: "Unspoiled was the deal."
Liam: Wasn't the deal.
Travis: No, it's great. You can really argue all you want to, or I'll just smash your fucking head in.
Liam: Wasn't the deal!
Taliesin: Alive was the deal.
Liam: We said you were alive, your weapons were ours. What, have you got shit in your ears?
Orion: I thought you meant you wouldn't get dirty, like you know, not spoiled. Which I was totally fine with.
Matt: Takes a couple of steps forward towards you, holding the warhammer out.
Liam: Your skull is unspoiled.
Matt: Suddenly, he turns completely invisible, vanishes from sight.
Laura: My perception's really high, can I try to find him?
Liam: Yeah, we can. Perception check.
Travis: You dicks.
Matt: You hear (footsteps running).
Liam: Perception check.
Laura: Wait, no!
Orion: He's gone.
Laura: Mother bitch.
Marisha: It's fine.
Liam: 18 for me.
Marisha: Just let him go, it's all he's got.
Ashley: We should throw something.
Travis: (high-pitched) I want the hammer!
Marisha: It's all he's got right now. He's naked, and now he's invisible running through a cavern.
Laura: He's not naked!
Matt: At this point--
Liam: I'm gonna attack him.
Matt: Before you have the opportunity--
Liam: Yeah?
Matt: -- he becomes visible again, about 20 feet out, gone down the stairs and towards the front door and he just--
Liam: I'm throwing a dagger at him.
Marisha: Oh look.
Matt: Go for it.
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: And I'm throwing my ax at him with the chain of returning as well.
Liam: Oh good, that's great. 28 for me.
Orion: Oh shit.
Matt: All right, that hits.
Liam: Yeah, sure it does. Dick!
Matt: It's not a Sneak Attack, just damage.
Liam: Yeah, that's fine.
Matt: You chuck your ax at him.
Travis: 17.
Marisha: And I just yell, sorry!
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 17.
Liam: Ten for me.
Matt: All right, so go ahead and roll damage for both of you.
Liam: Ten.
Matt: He is there, standing in place with his arms locked like this.
Laura: Oh, Clarota.
Travis: 15.
Matt: 15 damage?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: Should've left the hammer.
Liam: Ten.
Matt: Ten damage, all right. There's now a significant amount of blood beginning to pool down his feet, as he's standing there. As he is frozen in place, Clarota just kinda steps up to the front of him, grabs his cheeks and pulls his head in towards him, as his tendrils slowly wrap around his head. You can see them meet at the back of his skull, and with this horrible crunching sound, you see his head shudder, as his limbs go limp.
Liam: (sings) Do do do do doo, I'm lovin' it. (all laugh)
Matt: A few moments of this horrible slurping sound--
Laura: Oh no.
Matt: -- and you hear this dull, sickening, hollow (suction) sound. The tentacles release, Clarota releases his grip from his head, and the captain falls onto his back, a giant bloodied hole in the center of his skull.
Ashley: He ate his brain?
Travis: I guess you should've left the hammer, shouldn't you?
Taliesin: Some people are terrible losers, just really terrible.
Orion: I'm going to loot the body.
Laura: Yeah, well. Yeah, we definitely do that.
Travis: I would like to pick up the hammer.
Marisha: This is a good lesson, to no one else that's watching.
Orion: Clarota, that was incredible. Well done!
Laura: Clarota--
Ashley: Clarota, I am a fan.
Marisha: No one is watching this valuable lesson.
Taliesin: Do not be an oathbreaker.
Marisha: To not be an oathbreaker.
Taliesin: Know when you've lost your clothes.
Laura: Was that actually, like, a meal for you?
Matt: As you're looking, you can see there's that kind of weird purplish crimson around his tendrils, as he kinda wipes it off with his hands, and goes, "It's enough to sustain me a while. I was getting hungry."
Laura: Well. Better him than us, I say.
Travis: Right. Me, I'm just an appetizer.
Orion: Yes, indeed.
Laura: Loot the body!
Matt: Yes, so you loot the body. You find amongst all the duergar bodies here, as you're quickly jumping around and grabbing, it's hard to count the exact amount, but you're looking at somewhere in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred gold pieces. You'll have to check later.
Laura: Ooh!
Liam: Mm-hm.
Laura: I write that down.
Orion: He was a general.
Matt: A series of black iron weapons. None of them seem to, at a quick glance, have any sort of magical value. The blackened plate armor on the duergar itself does radiate a magical essence, as does the warhammer he was holding.
Laura: Is it just him wearing the black plate armor--
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: -- or any of the other bodies wearing it, too?
Matt: There are a few that are wearing black plate, but they're not equivalent enchanted.
Laura: We should take that and put it in the bag of holding, so we can sneak in if we want to.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: Tiberius, can you tell us anything about these things?
Laura: How many sets were there?
Matt: From what is in here, that would be 11 sets, total.
Orion: Yes, that hammer is amazing, obviously, because we saw it in action. I'd say Grog should have it.
Laura: 11 sets of armor!
Matt: Because there were also sets that were on the rack at the very front.
Laura: Nice!
Ashley: Hey.
Marisha: Is Grog about to get a new weapon?
Travis: 11 sets of armor, okay.
Orion: And I'll do an arcana check, right? An arcana check on the stuff?
Matt: An arcana check, yeah.
Taliesin: Laura, you got a grapple arrow, last I gave you, by the way.
Laura: I did?
Orion: 23.
Taliesin: Yeah, I got it-- you now have a trap arrow.
Laura: A grappler arrow?
Taliesin: Yeah, you fire it and it prones somebody.
Laura: Seriously? That's so cool, thank you!
Matt: There you go, sir.
Taliesin: I'm gonna Hawkeye you out at some point.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Taliesin: I know.
Travis: Can you do a magical check on the-- Oh, he's got it.
Orion: I did.
Matt: So, as Tiberius is looking over the equipment, kind of poring through his arcane knowledge.
Orion: Oh, oh, ooh! I think Pike and Grog would benefit from these, most definitely. Here.
Laura: What is it? What was it?
Liam: There's not any kind of dark magic about the armor, is there?
Orion: I mean, it's dark in color.
Liam: Yes, that's fine.
Orion: But it's, you know, your standard arcana magic.
Ashley: Clarota, so when you eat their brains, do you also get their thoughts, maybe?
Travis: Ooh! The heavy plate armor has resistance to fire damage.
Ashley: Or it's just-- it's gone after that.
Travis: The warhammer--
Liam: Sh!
Matt: "There are residual memories, thoughts. It's delicious." And you can see, there's this almost rapturous look in his face you haven't seen before. For a moment, Clarota looks a little younger, a little stronger, a little more dangerous. And you're put off a little bit by it.
Travis: Clarota is Dracula.
Matt: But there's kind of this momentary kind of relishing in the moment and--
Marisha: Do we need to give you a moment alone? We can leave.
Matt: "He speaks the truth about the path into the Emberhold."
Laura: All right.
Liam: So, he spoke of some sort of trap door that's easy to open from within, but not from outside, correct?
Marisha: It was hidden by a lava flow.
Laura: Yes, two lava flows--
Matt: The smaller of the two.
Laura: -- the smaller of the two.
Liam: The smaller of the two.
Matt: On the left side.
Marisha: On the left side of the keep.
Laura: Yes. Can I ask a question?
Matt: Yes?
Travis: I'm raising my hand.
Laura: Are there a lot of other soldiers still in the camp, or did we--
Matt: Oh, there are plenty of soldiers still in the camp.
Liam: Yeah, we--
Laura: Ooh.
Matt: You stealthed into the barracks.
Laura: Oh shit! We should've kept him alive, you guys! Okay, okay, okay. Yes, Grog?
Liam: Well, he was about to walk out the door and cause mayhem.
Orion: That's true.
Marisha: That's true. He was gonna alert everybody.
Travis: Can I harvest any natural armor from the bulette? The kitty?
Laura: Ooh!
Matt: You can certainly try. There's plates that have been broken and cracked. You can try and start cleaving away at it.
Travis: All right, yes, I start butchering, or something, the bulette.
Matt: Okay, you start-- It's really tough hide. You know, 'cause you tried to cut through before and you managed to make a few marks. It takes you a few minutes. You manage to get, let's say, about three saucer-shaped pieces of armor out of it.
Travis: All right.
Matt: You could definitely get more, but then you start hearing bells going off.
Laura: Shit.
Travis: Shit.
Orion: What do I see? I'm still on the roof.
Laura: Okay, we should all-- Can we all--
Matt: You don't see anything yet. You just hear bells starting to go off in the city.
Laura: Okay, we should all put on black armor. Does that matter?
Liam: We should just get out of here. Keyleth, can you fucking eagle up and let's go.
Matt: You start hearing horns.
Laura: We need to free those dwarves.
Marisha: Eagle up?
Matt: Big horns. You start seeing torches being lit.
Laura: Stealth, stealth. And get out. Go stealth and get out.
Liam: We need to get out, now.
Orion: Oh guys, the jig is up!
Laura: I shoot my grapple thing and go up out of the ceiling.
Liam: Tiberius.
Orion: What?
Liam: Cast Fly on this fucker right here, we need to get out of here. We just need to get out the way we came in.
Marisha: I cast Pass Without A Trace. Everyone stand near me. And I'll turn into an eagle and I scoop up the gnomes.
Matt: Okay, what's the radius on Pass Without A Trace?
Liam: Like a thousand yards.
Marisha: Like a hundred yards.
Matt: Four miles, it's all I got.
Laura: But I take the dust of tracelessness out of the bag of holding and I sprinkle it around the room.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Can we grapple up out from the ceiling?
Matt: Well, the arrow that you have that he made, it's essentially an arrow that bursts into a tanglefoot bag. When it bursts, it grapples whoever's there, it's not like grappling an arrow.
Taliesin: Yeah, it's not like a string arrow, although I'll build that.
Laura: Oh, I thought it was like a grappling--
Taliesin: It's a trip arrow.
Laura: Oh, that's cool, okay.
Marisha: A 30-foot radius.
Taliesin: I'll make you a grappling-- I didn't follow that though. I'll make you a grappling arrow.
Laura: I have a grappling hook. Yeah, we should grapple out.
Matt: 30-foot radius, okay, so you could just--
Marisha: Just, hug me.
Matt: -- barely get Tiberius in there if you--
Marisha: Stay close.
Travis: You can go on my back.
Matt: On the platform, so yeah.
Ashley: Okay, I'm gonna jump on Grog's back.
Travis: Yeah, and I pick up Scanlan under my arm.
Laura: We have a regular grappling hook, we'll just get up out of the--
Taliesin: We have a flying carpet.
Ashley: And hold onto some straps.
Matt: All right, so Scanlan-- Both gnomes get grabbed by Keyleth as--
Orion: And we're all on the carpet?
Liam: The carpet's away, but this guy is flying?
Orion: Yes.
Liam: Flying Grog.
Travis: I am? I thought we were all-- Okay.
Liam: No, you can't go on the carpet. You're too heavy.
Laura: What are we doing?
Liam: We're going up. Straight up.
Laura: Up and out. Can we stealth, while we do it?
Matt: So, you guys, right now, as you're carrying the two gnomes, all of you except for Grog are on the carpet, correct?
Travis: Yep, I'm flying.
Matt: You're flying. Okay, so how many spells do you have left on that? One left? All right.
Laura: Where's Trinket?
Taliesin: Trinket's back on the other side.
Matt: Trinket's back on the other side. Trinket didn't come with you to the battle, because there was nobody to get Trinket across.
Laura: Oh, he's just on the other side by himself, all lonely?
Matt: Yeah, I know.
Liam: He's in goblin town.
Matt: Eh, you weren't here. (all laugh)
Matt: You weren't here to protect your bear.
Laura: That's so terrible.
Ashley: He's safe over there?
Matt: Hopefully.
Ashley: Oh Trinket!
Travis: He's been raging.
Matt: Everyone, make a stealth check. With a plus ten additional modifier thanks to Keyleth's spell.
Travis: Oh, awesome. That helped.
Orion: 20.
Ashley: Oh, 20!
Marisha: 18.
Travis: Natural? Oh.
Laura: Nice. Ooh, natural 20!
Taliesin: 19.
Travis: 19.
Ashley: 20.
Laura: Natural 20.
Travis: Natural 20.
Laura: 31 for me.
Liam: 29.
Matt: All right, so you all take off. As you do, you can see now, probably close to 30 or 40 duergar have now begun rushing towards the barracks in the center of that main open area where that wooden platform was, where Scanlan originally saw a mind flayer. As you rush up, you hear (speaks Undercommon). You hear it as Undercommon, screaming, "There! Above, look!"
Laura: Oh, they saw us.
Ashley: Maybe you should scream, like, no, they went the other way!
Liam: Just keep going up, up, up.
Matt: A stream of javelins comes firing up in your direction.
Laura: How did they see us? I thought we were stealthed.
Orion: I see where it's coming and I shoot a Fireball.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: That's good, that's good.
Marisha: Wait, what are you doing?
Matt: Okay, so there's a volley of javelins and a Fireball streaking past. You'll be able to get ten of them in that Fireball blast, go ahead and roll for damage on that. However, for those that rolled less than 20 on stealth, each of you are getting three javelins each to you. So that's you two, and Grog. What'd you roll again?
Marisha: Less than 20.
Orion: 22.
Matt: Okay, yeah. So you three. So three javelins against you, miss you entirely. Percy. Actually, one more against you, Keyleth. That one does hit. You take 14 points of piercing damage as the javelin just gleans off the side of your giant eagle torso.
Marisha: (eagle noises)
Matt: Percy, that's a 21, an 18, and a 20. So you take three javelins. 24 points of piercing damage.
Taliesin: 24 points?
Matt: Yeah, 24 points total, as three javelins-- Two strike you off the shoulders and one actually embeds itself partway into your waist and you have to pull it out, and probably dug a good six, seven inches in.
Ashley: What are you at?
Taliesin: I'm at 15.
Ashley: 15?
Orion: By the way, 41 points of fire damage.
Taliesin: I was already really low.
Travis: Take me instead.
Laura: We haven't healed him yet.
Ashley: Wait, we healed the other game. Even with that?
Taliesin: Oh, did I fully heal?
Matt: All right, the three that are going towards Grog--
Travis: Yeah, come on.
Matt: That-- Natural 20. A 17, what's your AC?
Ashley: No, it was like 24.
Travis: 18.
Ashley: 24 points.
Matt: That one misses, and the last one-- Yeah, two natural 20s.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Ashley: That was 24.
Matt: Not even joking.
Liam: Double crits, oh.
Matt: All right, so--
Laura: Two crits against you?
Liam: Good thing you got a thousand hit points.
Travis: (high-pitched) Oh no.
Liam: That's the point of a meat tank.
Matt: You take a total of 36 points of piercing damage, Grog.
Ashley: And he still has more hitpoints than we do.
Matt: Yeah, probably.
Marisha: Ouchies.
Matt: Oh, barbarian.
Liam: If Scanlan were here, he'd moon and blind all.
Laura: He is here, technically.
Matt: He is here, Scanlan's holding on tight as--
Liam: He's here, he's watching.
Taliesin: Scanlan's peeing, peeing down.
Matt: However, as the javelins strike all you guys, moments later there's a gargantuan explosion, and there's a flash of reddish light from below. A giant fiery blooming explosion bursts into the center of that area. You can see duergar thrown left and right. You manage to take out about 12 of them in that one blast.
Orion: Yes!
Laura: Nice!
Liam: Yeah, home slice.
Matt: You guys continue, cresting over the top. You can now see more and more are starting to gather, the bells are going off, the horns are blowing hard. You can see a bunch of them are now running over to what looks like some of this siege equipment they had constructed--
Marisha: Oh.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Which includes a few large ballistae.
Liam: I think we should friggin' dive bomb towards the far tunnel past this war camp.
Laura: No, but Trinket!
Liam: Is fine, he's hiding out. They don't know he's here.
Travis: Leave him.
Taliesin: He'll be fine.
Orion: I'm not concerned with the bear right now!
Liam: We're going to dive. Yes, dive bomb, dive bomb!
Taliesin: The bear can take care of himself.
Liam: I take hold of the front of the carpet and steer it up and over, along the roof and then down towards the tunnel. I'm steering the carpet.
Matt: Okay. You guys are coming down. You basically shot up, curved around--
Laura: We shouldn't go down.
Matt: And you're going backwards towards the barracks. As you do, another volley of--
Laura: We got to free those dwarves, y'all.
Matt: Another volley comes to the guys who were under-stealthed.
Liam: We don't have to. That seems complicated.
Orion: Who's not stealthed?
Matt: However, there is one attack less each because of the duergar that you had taken out. So, against Keyleth, one hits. You take 12 points of piercing damage.
Marisha: I am no longer an eagle.
Taliesin: Oh my God.
Travis: Oh shit, really?
Matt: All right, a two and a one versus Percy.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: Are you paying attention?
Orion: Wait, what?
Travis: She's not an eagle anymore.
Matt: All right, so.
Laura: Keyleth isn't a--
Marisha: I hit zero hit points as an eagle.
Ashley: Wait, what are you again?
Laura: What happened?
Liam: She's not an eagle and she's falling with the gnomes.
Matt: Keyleth's form shifts back into that of Keyleth. You guys are about 80 feet up.
Marisha: Help!
Laura: Okay, okay!
Ashley: Can I--
Matt: At which point, both Scanlan and Pike go into a free fall along with Keyleth.
Ashley: Wait, can I--
Laura: No, no, she was on Grog, she was--
Orion: Are we under them? Are we under them?
Liam: I don't know, are we?
Ashley: No, I was on her.
Matt: No, you guys are about parallel. You guys were moving together.
Liam: Parallel?
Orion: Go under them!
Laura: Yeah, we dive under them.
Liam: Dive, dive, dive, dive!
Orion: I cast Glacial Blast and I create a bridge that scoops them up, right under them. As we dive right under them.
Liam: Party trick.
Matt: Okay, you guys are out in the middle of the open cavern. There's no place to connect the bridge, so you're essentially creating a giant ice--
Liam: Chunk.
Laura: Chunk.
Matt: Chunk right beneath them. Which is also now in freefall.
Orion: Huh? No!
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Even wizards make mistakes.
Orion: Damn it!
Matt: So as you guys try and swoop underneath as they're plummeting-- You're riding this, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Okay.
Orion: No, I didn't think of that.
Marisha: I don't know what to do.
Laura: Can we try to catch-- can we try to-- what do I have?
Ashley: Wait, can I--
Travis: Are we over the war camp, or are we over the--
Liam: 25.
Laura: Over the war camp.
Matt: All right, so you swoop underneath. A sudden motion, as you're trying to cast. Go ahead and roll a concentration check on this.
Marisha: Oh, come on, Tiberius.
Taliesin: Oh boy.
Marisha: Oh, save my life, again, Tiberius.
Orion: Oh no.
Laura: Can I try to--
Marisha: Oh shit.
Liam: I let go of the front of the carpet, I stick a--
Ashley: Wait, wait, wait, wait, can I cast War God's Blessing to give him a plus ten?
Matt: Unfortunately, you're falling.
Ashley: Fuck.
Matt: You're like (worried noise), you're just plummeting through the air like a rock because you're in full plate armor.
Laura: Can I use the rope of endless twine and try to lasso one of them? 'Cause I'm really a good shot.
Ashley: How far are we falling?
Matt: You have to pull it out of the bag of holding and then turn into a lasso, that's gonna take you a full minute, so you don't have time.
Liam: I have a rope. I let go of the front of the carpet, I put one end of the rope in my sister's hand, and I jump off towards Pike, holding it around in one hand as I go--
Laura: Oh god.
Taliesin: I grapple onto her to hold her down.
Ashley: No! No, no, no, I have so much armor.
Laura: Okay, then you should--
Matt: All right guys, so here's what happens. In the time this has transpired, you've rushed underneath with the magic carpet, all of you barely managed to hold on, as both Pike and Scanlan and Keyleth all slam into the top of the--
Laura: Oh okay, except you're dangling off of it now by a rope.
Matt: You lost your concentration, so Glacial Blast didn't go off, thankfully. That would've been really bad.
Marisha: Wait, wait, we slam into the top of what?
Taliesin: Us.
Matt: You guys slam onto the top of the rest of the group, in there.
Laura: That's too many people on the carpet.
Matt: Because you lost your concentration, your flight spell also dissipates. Grog is now plummeting.
Laura: Oh no!
Travis: Yay!
All: (worried noises)
Laura: We're gonna die!
Matt: The carpet now has too much weight and is currently giving out.
Liam: #savecriticalrole.
Orion: Get me close to him. I cast Featherfall on you.
Matt: It's slowing your fall, but you guys are-- you're coming down at a very, very fast pace at an angle over the barracks towards the back end of the war camp.
Laura: Oh shit.
Marisha: Can I cast Wind Wall right underneath of the carpet to kind of like airbend us up?
Matt: You can attempt to. Grog--
Travis: I begin to fart to slow the fall.
Orion: Who needs Featherfall? I can do it in a bunch!
Marisha: Ahh!
Matt: Everybody, at this point--
Liam: But wait, Dungeon Master?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Re-explain what's happening. So the carpet is falling, not as fast as it would, but--
Matt: Essentially, you guys are flying beside each other, the three that were falling, you guys swooped underneath and caught them, however it's too much weight to bear, the carpet's now--
Liam: How high are we at this second?
Matt: At this second, you're about 60-70 feet up.
Marisha: Ohh.
Liam: And the closest building, the highest building under us is how tall?
Marisha: Oh, Jesus.
Matt: It's about 15 feet tall.
Liam: Ohh.
Matt: Grog, however, goes into a full plummet. You guys have just caught the rest of them, you've all caught them, you're crashing down.
Marisha: And did the Wind Wall thing work?
Matt: Go ahead and roll a concentration.
Laura: Everybody jump up in the air!
Matt: Your constitution modifier.
Marisha: Fucking shit. Not good. Seven.
Matt: The spell fizzles.
Liam: Unpause. How far are we from the tunnel that we were talking about?
Matt: From what you can see here, you're probably about 50 to 60 feet.
Laura: We're right over the camp, aren't we?
Matt: You're towards the back of it, thankfully, the barracks are towards the back of it, so maybe about 50 to 60 feet from the full tunnel.
Orion: Before where the drop is, and that's where that bottom tunnel is down there?
Matt: Yep.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: You guys go crashing at an angle.
Taliesin: I'm going to brace to jump. I'm bracing to roll.
Laura: Yeah, we're all like bracing.
Marisha: Three-point landing!
Liam: I'm grabbing for Pike and going like this.
Laura: I have Scanlan!
Marisha: What's Grog doing?
Orion: Where's Grog at?
Laura: He's falling.
Liam: Grog's gone. Grog's down.
Matt: Grog is completely separate from you. He was flying, and lost concentration of his spell. Grog's like a stone.
Laura: No, Grog!
Orion: Can I leap towards him?
Taliesin: Off what?
Marisha: And do what?
Matt: Off of the carpet--
Orion: Off of the carpet! Yes!
Liam: Do what?
Laura: You leap off of the carpet?
Matt: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check. With a disadvantage, because you are jumping off of a currently flimsy flying carpet to try and catch up to him.
Laura: Oh no.
Orion: Right now, while I'm doing this, I'm going to cast Featherfall on myself.
Travis: Wait, before, you gotta get to me first, because it will slow you too much.
Orion: Oh. It would, wouldn't it? I thought it was only when going down.
Travis: Gotta get to me first, motherfucker.
Matt: Go for it.
Orion: Whoa. Okay.
Matt: So what's your acrobatics check? The lower of the two.
Liam: You fall a lot.
Travis: Yeah. Big things go down.
Orion: 15 and 13.
Matt: Okay. You manage to fumble out of the carpet, however, you are now just end-over-end falling now off of the side of the carpet on your own.
Liam: This is tense.
Laura: This is tense.
Matt: You're having a hard time even seeing Grog now. The world's just spinning and spinning and spinning.
Laura: Oh God.
Travis: It's like Gravity.
Matt: You can attempt--
Orion: Now I'm going to cast Featherfall.
Matt: Go ahead, cast and roll concentration check. What did you roll?
Marisha: He rolled a 19. Which is good.
Matt: Okay. Featherfall gets to you just in time. Your descent slows. In that time, Grog has impacted.
Marisha: Fuck!
Laura: Oh no, Grog!
Liam: We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit. I'm shielding the healer.
Laura: I'm shielding Scanlan.
Matt: So you all brace for impact. The actual carpet's careening out of control. You can see there's just barely the top of a building you might be able to try and skim.
Laura: Can we jump onto the top of the building?
Matt: This is going to be up to the one who's been steering this whole time. Go ahead and make an intelligence check.
Laura: Intelligence!
Liam: Intelligence?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: Can I assist?
Matt: No.
Travis: Thank God it's not me.
Marisha: Can we do nothing and--
Liam: Good, good, good, good. 24.
Matt: 24?
Liam: Yeah, so I'm pretty smart.
Matt: You just managed to skim the edge, which lessens your impact slightly, however, it does send you all into a full end-over-end topple.
Liam: Still holding a gnome!
Matt: Everyone. Everyone. Make an acrobatics check.
Laura: Oh, god. Which one to roll, which one to roll.
Marisha: Oh, no. What's going on with Grog?
Liam: I guess that's what we'll find out afterwards.
Matt: Grog's impacted. He was falling faster than you guys were, he's six hundred pounds going into straight freefall. You guys had a little bit of a fall break.
Marisha: Ah, this is going terribly! I'm failing!
Orion: Do I have to do one also?
Matt: Everyone. Oh, except for you, because you're floating.
Liam: Do the halflings-- Shit! Do the gnomes get an advantage since the half-elves are protecting them?
Laura: Depending on how we roll?
Matt: It's based on how you guys roll, because you're the ones who are holding onto them.
Liam: Oh, okay.
Laura: Welp, Scanlan. I'm sorry to let you know--
Taliesin: No.
Liam: Oh no!
Matt: So you got Pike?
Liam: Yeah, I got Pike.
Matt: What'd you roll?
Liam: 18.
Matt: Natural one.
Ashley: 13.
Travis: 18.
Taliesin: 23.
Marisha: Four.
Matt: Okay, so half-damage for you.
Laura: But I have a plus nine acrobatics! Plus nine acrobatics!
Liam: Doesn't matter.
Laura: Doesn't matter on a natural crit fail.
Taliesin: Still gonna knock me out.
Matt: Roll some fall damage here.
Laura: I'm sorry, Scanlan!
Liam: It's all right, I got the healer, I got the healer.
Marisha: It's not gonna be good.
Travis: You're gonna be like an ACME cartoon and just leave a (pff)
Laura: (pff)
Liam: (pff)
Matt: 18 points of damage.
Taliesin: I'm out.
Marisha: You're out again?
Laura: You're unconscious again?
Taliesin: Yeah.
Matt: He didn't have a lot of hit points left.
Laura: Oh no, we're all dead!
Marisha: This the second time Grog's almost fallen to his death.
Matt: 18 points of damage to you. The rest of you all take 36 points of fall damage, except for Grog.
Liam: Everybody, everybody?
Laura: Everybody? As a group, like we all failed as a group?
Matt: Well, no, no, sorry. You succeeded, you rolled a--
Liam: 18.
Matt: 18, so you would also take half-damage, so you would take 18 as well.
Ashley: I take--
Matt: You take half that as well, thanks to his roll as well.
Travis: I rolled an 18.
Ashley: Everybody in this club getting hit points.
Matt: Right, you were in full plummet, you can reduce the damage slightly.
Travis: Well, I was very graceful on the way down.
Matt: Yeah, you take 45 points of damage from the impact, Grog.
Marisha: 45?
Matt: 45 points of damage.
Marisha: Oh.
Liam: It was halved, so eight.
Matt: And leave a small crater from the impact.
Travis: Thank you.
Marisha: You know what, that could've been worse.
Laura: And I take 35?
Matt: You and Scanlan both take 36, which puts Scanlan into a negative as well, because he wasn't-- he was not at--
Laura: No, no! He was fully healed.
Travis: Nope.
Matt: No, he wasn't.
Laura: (Softly) Fuck.
Liam: No, sorry, no.
Matt: So, you all tumble end over end, come to rest.
Marisha: We just crash-landed in a war camp.
Matt: Yeah. On the far end of it, thankfully.
Marisha: Oh boy.
Matt: You guys can hear the bells and the horns going in the distance. It looks like all the rest of the folks that were stationed here moved towards the center. You managed to arc over them, but they're going to be here shortly.
Travis: Are we near their big war machines?
Matt: No, the ballistae are on the opposite--
Orion: So we can see the ledge and that cavern where we were, where we found the--
Matt: Well, the ledge is back in the other direction. You guys are going towards the tunnel on the opposite side.
Liam: Vax is pulling up Pike onto her feet and dragging her towards Scanlan, 'cause I know how fucked up he was from the last battle.
Ashley: Where's Scanlan? How close--
Matt: Okay, you guys-- and you, you're kinda getting up on your knees, coughing--
Marisha: How, how--
Ashley: Percy's out, let's go--
Liam: But so is Scanlan.
Matt: Percy's just face-down in the ground, scrapes across the side of his face.
Ashley: Scanlan's out, too? Fuck.
Liam: Scanlan's out, too, right?
Matt: Scanlan's also out.
Travis: How about-- I'll give him a level three potion and you go heal Scanlan.
Laura: No, you, here, you take care of him, I'm right next to Scanlan,
Matt: You guys are roughly about ten feet from each other from the impact, just, you were scattered, and then you kind of regrouped.
Marisha: Okay. Can we see people running towards us?
Matt: Not yet, but you assume it's only a short period of time.
Orion: Yeah, yeah, we have some time left--
Marisha: We don't, I don't know.
Matt: Grog, what you at?
Travis: 39.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: She's doing a Mass Healing--
Ashley: A Mass Healing Word.
Matt: Okay. You barely get yourself out of the crater. That's gonna suck tomorrow!
Marisha: Mass Healing Word?
Liam: You take Scanlan, I'll take Percy.
Laura: Okay! I'm gonna--
Liam: Healing potions out.
Matt: As this is happening, Percy, go ahead and make a death saving throw.
Laura: Oh!
Travis: A death saving throw?
Liam: Sorry, here's three--
Taliesin: Is that-- Is that just--
Matt: What did you roll?
Taliesin: A nine.
Matt: That's a fail, so mark off one fail on your death saving throw on your sheet.
Laura: (gasps)
Ashley: No no no no!
Laura: No no no no!
Travis: Oh shit!
Liam: Sorry I'm late, Percy.
Matt: Scanlan does make his.
Liam: He's all right, he's all right, he's all right. I've got a healing potion and I'm pouring it--
Ashley: But I'm doing--
Liam: I'm pinching Percy's nose and pouring it in his mouth.
Laura: And I'm pouring some down Scanlan's throat.
Matt: Okay, all right. So both you guys pour healing potions. That is-- those are the normal ones? The common? The regular healing?
Liam: I think so.
Laura: Yeah?
Matt: 2d4 + 2. Go ahead and roll that.
Liam: (whispers) 2d4 + 2.
Travis: I'm taking a level two potion, myself. Just--
Taliesin: 2d4 + 2?
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Liam: Eight. Eight for Percy.
Matt: That's four--
Taliesin: Oh! So I'm at plus eight now?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Yes.
Liam: You're up.
Matt: Scanlan also comes to consciousness.
Laura: 2d4? That's pathetic.
Matt: That's the cheapest one you've got. 2d4 + 2.
Liam: Let's get the fuck out of here and they can--
Laura: Okay, fine.
Taliesin: She was gonna do a Mass Healing--
Marisha: Yeah, what's your Mass Healing Word?
Orion: I'd like to know-- on the way down, I was doing a little chant and I was expending my sorcery points to do Flexible Casting, so I regain a slot spell on my third-level spells.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: As we're getting up, can I see-- Is the camp nearby, where the prisoners are? Is that anywhere near us?
Matt: No, that's towards the center of the camp.
Liam: We gotta keep moving. I pull out another corked potion and slap it into Percy's hand.
Marisha: Yeah, we gotta go.
Liam: And then grab him by the wrist and just start walking.
Taliesin: I'm up.
Marisha: Here, wait. Save the potion, I cast Healing Word on Percy.
Ashley: Hold on, I'm gonna do a Mass Cure Wounds.
Laura: Mass Cure Wounds?
Matt: All right. So as you guys are running towards the back, towards the main tunnel, which you can now see, it's roughly a 40- by 30-foot tunnel. You go running through the buildings. You see a few duergar kinda poke out from the buildings.
Laura: Can we stealth while we're doing this, or are we too, like, injured?
Orion: No, this is--
Matt: No, you guys are just bolting at this point. You're not even concentrating on stealth right now.
Laura: Bolting it, right.
Taliesin: This is, this is--
Matt: Plus, with the group-- Basically, a few of you would stealth and the rest of you would be left in the dust, so you're just kind of all pushing for speed at this point.
Laura: Okay.
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: You all manage to push towards the back of the entire war camp, into this tunnel. Hearing behind you the distant echoing shouts of approximately 30-plus duergar heading in your direction. You hear a few other ballista bolts hitting the wall above you of the stone.
Orion: Are we all in the tunnel?
Matt: You guys have now pushed into the tunnel.
Orion: I wait for everybody to pass and I cast all my Grand Columns.
Matt: Okay, how many can you--
Orion: Three.
Matt: Three per spell? And how many spell levels do you have currently?
Orion: That's it, that's what I did the SP for, so that I could cast this right now.
Matt: Right. So you have one.
Orion: I have none in my column.
Matt: Right. How many spell castings did you have left? Two?
Orion: No, I had one.
Ashley: (whispers) 24.
Taliesin: 24?
Laura: 24 mass?
Ashley: 24 mass cure.
Matt: One left. So you get three columns. It's 30 feet wide.
Laura: Oh, she just healed everybody for 24 points.
Orion: (whispers) Oh, it's 30--
Marisha: Oh, dope.
Matt: Okay, everyone heals for 24 points. Add that up.
Liam: Oh, I feel good!
Laura: I feel pretty good now.
Travis: Dude! Kick that shit.
Laura: What what!
Orion: It's not enough, is it?
Matt: No.
Ashley: (sighs) Okay. Including myself?
Liam: Yes.
Travis: Yes.
Orion: Are the caves stone? Like the cave--
Matt: The walls are stone.
Travis: Ugh, that's huge.
Laura: Oh my god, it's major.
Orion: Can I like, do it from the side? Can I attempt to?
Matt: Pillars go straight up, unfortunately. It's the nature of the spell's creation.
Marisha: Well wait, I can do what you're trying to do.
Orion: Oh! Oh yeah!
Marisha: I do Wall Of Stone.
Orion: There you go!
Matt: Okay! So as you're trying to figure this out, Keyleth steps over--
Marisha: I'm like, oh, is this, oh--
Orion: It's-- Oh!
Marisha: Sorry! You should've just-- I would've-- they're not very--
Orion: They're columns.
Marisha: Yeah.
Orion: You're good. The wall's good.
Marisha: Right.
Orion: Good.
Laura: Are we running? I don't know what you guys are doing. What's happening right now?
Matt: As you guys are doing this and rushing in, you're realizing there's one member of your party that you haven't had a lot of time with--
Laura: Clarota!
Liam: Clarota!
Matt: -- that you didn't think about until this moment.
Liam: Clarota, yeah. Clarota.
Marisha: Oh, yeah!
Matt: You now see, kind of, like, floating, via levitation ability, about 30 feet away, slowly descending towards you, as you're putting up the wall of stone--
Orion: Oh! Wait! Hold on!
Travis: Come on Squidworth, over here!
Matt: Two bolts go firing towards him; one whooshes overhead, a second one--
Marisha: Clarota!
Matt: (impact sound) -- through his back, out the front of his chest--
Laura: No!
Matt: -- off the shoulder.
Orion: Come on! We need to save him!
Liam: He's gotta have more than ten hit points.
Orion: Recess the wall, recess the wall!
Marisha: Wait!
Matt: You can see now-- and the bolt itself is about 4 feet long, made of this long, jagged, pointed arrow tip.
Laura: Oh, man.
Matt: Clarota begins to falter, and begins to hover towards you, almost, like, trying to swim through the air in your direction.
Laura: Can we run out, try to grab him?
Ashley: Can I grab him, hang on to him?
Orion: Oh!
Matt: He's about 20 feet from you now, you can try and reach out and put your hands towards him--
Orion: Boom!
Laura: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Travis: I take off and run to him.
Orion: Now I cast Glacial Blast, right under him, like a slide, right towards us-- and catch him.
Matt: Okay. So as you guys are running towards him, instead, this giant crystalline form of ice just--
Laura: Oh, all right.
Matt: -- crackles up into what looks like some sort of strange, winter festival slide that would be made for children in the center of town. Clarota--
Ashley: Awesome.
Matt: -- as it descends, two more bolts come towards him. Both (whoosh, whoosh). At this distance, in the darkness of the cavern, it's kind of hard for them to get a bead on him. Both just pass overhead. With eyes kind of lolling, Clarota comes down and hits the edge of the slide, and almost loses consciousness at that moment, sliding through the ice. You guys manage to capture, grappling his arms, lift him to his feet--
Marisha: And now, Wall Of Stone.
Matt: You all make it into the tunnel, Keyleth turns around, raising her hands, the actual blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a second, and then a giant, thick wall of natural rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you.
Orion: Nice.
Laura: I love you, Trinket!
Liam: Completely seals it?
Marisha: Oh, gosh.
Matt: Completely seals it. You guys are now in complete darkness.
Orion: Ooh! Light!
Matt: As the light hits, you can hear, just on the other side of the surface of the stone wall, javelins, other things are being shot at the stone wall--
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: -- but it's keeping it at bay. You guys are now at the wall, and behind you the tunnel continues into a passage you haven't seen yet.
Travis: Whatever we do from here, I sprinkle dust of tracelessness behind us the whole time like a fucking flower girl. (all laugh)
Liam: They could have magic in their possession, they could use magic as well, so let's move.
Laura: Yeah, they could get through it.
Orion: Yes.
Taliesin: Will a healing potion work on Clarota?
Ashley: So, Clarota's with us?
Laura: Clarota's with us.
Ashley: Can I go over to Clarota and try to heal him?
Laura: Don't get too close, he might just suck in your brain.
Matt: You can certainly try.
Taliesin: I've got a potion, so--
Marisha: Grog?
Ashley: Should we give him a potion?
Travis: What?
Marisha: Do you have any ale?
Travis: Yeah, I do have a cask, actually.
Marisha: I think I need a drink.
Travis: Right. I'll--
Taliesin: What's a level two potion do?
Travis: There you are.
Matt: A level two potion would be 4d4 + 4.
Travis: I go and hold his shoulders--
Marisha: I really need a drink.
Travis: -- whilst she tries to heal him, just in case he gets all sucky on her.
Ashley: I think he's gonna give him a potion.
Travis: Oh.
Taliesin: I am.
Travis: That's much less--
Laura: No!
Liam: Felicia Day, that's not nice!
Travis: Hey!
Taliesin: 17 points of healing.
Matt: Okay. 17 points to Clarota.
Ashley: What'd she say?
Matt: Which-- administering a potion to a mind flayer is an experience that very few in this world have probably ever, or ever will, experience. As you kind of reach over, grab his shoulder, you look for where to put it, and the tendrils kind of, like, flail about, but begin to-- they, as he notices what you're doing, kind of relax and open up, and you can now see the circular, lamprey-like, toothy maw of the mind flayer. It's a very disturbing, disgusting image, with this jagged, yellow teeth, in a circular form. You pop the cork, and just pour it in. As you do, you see the wounds across Clarota's form begin to seal. The arrow is still stuck in its torso.
Laura: Can we try to pull it out?
Ashley: Try to break off the part--
Matt: You can certainly try.
Travis: I got it (snap)!
Matt: Go ahead and make a-- this would be a medicine check.
Laura: Do you wanna do that, Grog?
Travis: I'll do the breaking part.
Matt: It's iron. It's solid iron.
Ashley: My medicine's a four.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Breaking it off is not gonna work.
Ashley: What's your medicine?
Travis: So? Zero.
Matt: You have to pull it from the wound.
Ashley: Okay. I'll try.
Taliesin: Who has a medicine?
Laura: So what are you--
Ashley: A four.
Laura: Okay. All right.
Ashley: What does everybody have?
Matt: Go for it.
Laura: Do it!
Ashley: Roll this guy? Okay. Nine?
Matt: A nine.
Laura: (laughs) Oh no.
Ashley: Sorry!
Matt: So. You take your moment, you view up where the puncture wound is, with a little bit of Grog's help, you both grab the edge, and you're like, 'On three. One, two, three, pull!' You pull through the wound, not against the arrow--
Travis: Right.
Matt: -- 'cause that would just tear everything out in the process, but nevertheless, in doing so, Clarota does take an additional eight points of damage.
Ashley: I'm sorry.
Matt: But, the wound is now no longer a giant--
Laura: Able to be healed.
Matt: -- it's now able to be healed completely, so. Clarota takes a moment and kind of grasps the wound.
Laura: I hand him a little healing potion, and say, sorry.
Matt: Shatters the glass. At which point, you now hear (impact sounds) against the stone wall.
Laura: We should move!
Ashley: Time to go!
Liam: Let's keep moving, yes? Yes.
Travis: I pick up Clarota. Yeah, why not.
Laura: Yeah, all right.
Travis: I pick up Clarota and we start running balls.
Laura: Is he good enough to walk or is he--
Matt: He's good enough to walk with you guys. Well--
Travis: Well, how about I put one arm under his face and help him.
Matt: So you're helping him.
Liam: No, that's-- hold on a second. I take out the flying carpet--
Laura: We still have the flying carpet?
Liam: Sure we do!
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Here, sit on this, Clarota.
Laura: If you need it.
Liam: That'd be easier, yes.
Matt: Clarota gets up on the carpet and-- "Thank you." The carpet kind of drifts alongside you guys. You guys are pushing backwards towards the cavern. The tunnel kind of begins to pinch a little bit. It gets to about a 15-foot width before it opens up again. You're about a hundred feet back. You can now see it opening into a-- what looks like an extension of the war camp. (all groan)
Laura: We should've gone down! What were we thinking?
Matt: Go ahead and make a perception check.
Liam: That guy was lying.
Laura: Well, he said go down. We didn't go down.
Liam: 21 for me.
Laura: 13 for me. I like how my passive perception is way higher than any rolls that I ever do.
Matt: I do keep that-- I keep tabs on that.
Taliesin: 22.
Marisha: Are we all doing perception rolls?
Matt: For the most part, we've got a few rolls, and it worked fine. Looking inside though, this camp looks like it's been abandoned.
Laura: Oh, good!
Matt: It looks like it was built, and then the expansion into the war camp you just escaped from seemed to be the next step. Like it's slowly advancing and this section of it has been in disuse. As you push in towards the center of the camp you can see there's older campfires, lots of the tents have like partially collapsed. Dust has gathered.
Liam: I'm keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit.
Matt: Okay. Looking around as well, you see all the equipment. Any pieces that would be of interest have either been taken-- either destroyed and are broken or have probably been moved into the war camp. You glance through a couple of the tents. Looking about, it's definitely been abandoned. It no longer serves a purpose and anything of use has been stripped and taken. This cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so. It's a little domed section, and you can now see there are two exit tunnels to this section. One that is kind of straight ahead, a little bit to the left. And one that veers off to the direct left of you. So if you're looking straight from the direction you came, there is one right ahead of you, a little bit to the left and one that goes quickly to the left.
Laura: Should we take the left one?
Travis: Which one's the left one?
Marisha: He mentioned the left.
Laura: Yeah, so maybe we should stay left.
Matt: Yeah, do that.
Liam: Clarota, do you know anything about these passages?
Laura: Do you remember anything?
Marisha: Wait, why did he say that? Why did you say that?
Matt: 'Cause they're both kind of left. It's a joke. Clarota takes a moment and kind of looks at you, kind of-- his breath. "I've not been this far up these tunnels. It's too dangerous this close to the war camp. I would've been killed in a second."
Laura: What about the general's memory? Anything there?
Matt: He kind of closes his eyes for a second. "One of these leads below, one of them leads to the surface. I can't recall which."
Laura: Can we go up and--
Travis: Let's split up!
Laura: No, can we go next to the one on the far left and see if I sense any like wind coming down, is there--
Matt: Going to the one on the far left, as you're stepping you hear a (muffled impact noise)--
Laura: Oh, well, good.
Matt: -- against the distant stone wall that you put up.
Travis: I think we get to pick one here.
Marisha: Are there any--
Ashley: He did say go left.
Matt: As you head to the tunnel, you don't sense any sort of temperature change, but it does seem to steady off into a decline that curves to the left.
Laura: We should do that.
Taliesin: Sounds good.
Marisha: Do you mean, are there like-- is there any wildlife, any bats, any type of animals, anything like that?
Matt: We shall say, a general sense of this area, you look and you can see, in this area, unlike the previous sections, there are small clusters of bats on the ceiling.
Marisha: Okay, I'm going to--
Matt: As apparently they have an exit of some kind to the surface.
Marisha: I'm going to go ahead and cast Beast Sense on one of the bats.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I'm going to channel myself through the bat and I'm going to make him fly down the far left tunnel.
Matt: Okay. So as you guys are walking over there, one of the bats--
Ashley: Good call.
Matt: -- heads down into the tunnel, continues into the darkness.
Marisha: Can I just see--
Matt: From the echolocation, which is a very strange sensation, you haven't really done this before for a bat and it's a very weird experience.
Marisha: Wow, guys, this is really trippy.
Taliesin: We just hear (bat sounds).
Matt: It continues about a steady 40-degree decline that goes further and further down.
Laura: Keep going down. Down, down, down.
Matt: Eventually, you get to a point where the bat is out of your sphere of influence and you lose your connection to the bat.
Laura: Keep going down?
Marisha: Well, I didn't really see much, but definitely there is a pretty steep incline. We could try it again and go down the other one.
Liam: This is a coin flip.
Laura: I think we keep going down. Just stick with it.
Orion: Hold on! Incline means up.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: No, it's a decline.
Marisha: Decline.
Orion: Decline means down.
Laura: Well, then let's go with the decline. Yes?
Taliesin: Yes.
Laura: Let's do it!
Taliesin: We go. With haste.
Laura: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Travis: With haste!
Laura: With stealth! With Dust of Tracelessness behind us.
Travis: Hey, flower girl!
Laura: Flower girl!
Orion: Actually, there's two tunnels, right?
Matt: There are two tunnels, yes.
Orion: And one's smaller than the other?
Matt: Correct.
Orion: Hm.
Matt: Yes?
Taliesin: There's no right answer here. It's just--
Orion: I know.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Orion: How big is the-- how wide is the smaller one that we're going through?
Matt: There's one, the one on the far end, the one that does not appear to be a decline, seems to be the widest of the two.
Travis: I pull out a torch. Will you light my torch?
Orion: Yeah.
Travis: Nice. (all laugh)
Travis: Are we going to the left?
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: I take off running to the left.
Laura: Oh, god. Grog!
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Running, running?
Travis: Running!
Liam: Really running?
Travis: Running to the left.
Orion: Oh man, oh no!
Matt: Grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel to the very left--
Laura: Grog! Stop!
Orion: Let's go, everybody!
Marisha: There he goes!
Laura: I'm gonna take off after him.
Matt: The heavy footsteps of Grog disappearing into the darkness--
Travis: (maniacal laugh)
Laura: We take off after him, 'cause he needs help.
Orion: Let's go!
Marisha: Grog, Grog! Don't run too far ahead-- He's gone.
Matt: You guys give chase.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: It's like having Goofy as a party member. (all laugh)
Liam: (Goofy laugh)
Ashley: Hodor!
Travis: Hah. Hodor.
Ashley: Hodor.
Matt: As you guys catch up to Grog, which isn't too hard--
Travis: What? I'm fast.
Matt: Are you going to a full sprint, though?
Travis: No, no, no. I mean. A leisurely jog.
Matt: Right. You catch up to Grog. The tunnel itself is about 30 feet wide, 20 feet tall. And it is a slow, continuously gradual decline and curve to the left.
Laura: Can you do another wall?
Matt: Like a spiral, downward.
Laura: No?
Travis: Maybe we could do a cave-in.
Laura: Well, that might be dangerous.
Travis: Yeah, but it'd be fun.
Matt: You guys continue for another 20 or so minutes down, before it opens up into a small alcove to the right, but the tunnel continues. This alcove, it's about 35, 40 feet in, and it looks like there are remnants here of a camp that was set up once. Similar to the war camp, but once again abandoned, or at least currently not in use.
Liam: Any useful shit?
Laura: Can we go, oh! Can we go in? We should probably rest, heal up, get our spells back. Can you cast the illusion terrain and make it look like there's no hole in the cavern here?
Marisha: No. I can't, today. I'm sorry.
Orion: If this is where we're gonna be chilling, I can seal off that tunnel still.
Laura: But we have to be able to get back out.
Orion: Right.
Travis: Not necessarily.
Ashley: If I--
Liam: No! If you seal off the passage, right, we keep going down, and if that's a dead end-- it's probably not-- if it is, can't we rest and use the same spell to open it up?
Orion: No, it's permanent.
Liam: That sucks.
Orion: But we would just have Grog hack away at it for a while--
Travis: Thank you!
Orion: It can be, you know, destroyed.
Travis: They do call me 'Grog the Locksmith.'
Orion: Right!
Travis: They don't call me that.
Laura: Can we go in and look at the camp and see, like, stealthily--
Matt: Yeah!
Laura: -- check out what the camp is?
Marisha: I can make it really foggy.
Matt: Go ahead and make an investigate check.
Marisha: I could do that.
Liam: Yes, we know that about you.
Travis: Oh, I can too!
Liam: What about in the game, though?
Marisha: I can make it look like a--
Laura: 20.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Well, that's a different story.
Matt: As you guys are having this conversation, Vex does a quick glance over, there are about four tents that are still set up, there appears to be a small ring where a fire was set up, and you can see kind of bits of charcoal--
Taliesin: Yes!
Matt: -- and bits of long, long, long forgotten burnt meat, remnants, charcoal, and such there.
Travis: I have two firewood bundles.
Taliesin: I'm gonna look for a seal, to see if there's a seal anywhere around.
Matt: You do see, on one of the walls--
Taliesin: Bam!
Matt: -- there is a similar seal of Bahamut.
Laura: (gasps) Oh! This was her camp!
Taliesin: Kima was here!
Laura: Kima was here!
Marisha: #kimawashere.
Matt: However, there are four tents here--
Laura: Oh.
Orion: Kima was here.
Matt: Which means-- previously you saw just one, from what you saw. There are four here.
Travis: She had babies.
Matt: It's an interesting change to your appearance. Means either been repurposed, or there were more people with her, or since then the tent, the camp has been used by other individuals aside from her.
Travis: Oh.
Matt: However, glancing through, you do notice that there are a few discarded travel bags--
Laura: Mine! Mine! Mine!
Marisha: Ooh!
Matt: -- carrying rope, grappling hooks, general cluster of torches, about eight in total--
Laura: Okay, that's nice. Torch, torch, torch, torch.
Travis: Thank you! Bag of holding, bag of holding.
Matt: And as you glance about you can see, in this alcove, looking at the dirt itself, it looks like there was a serious struggle. You can start seeing drag mark--
Laura: Can I use Tracking and see what happened, like Prince Humperdink, please? Can do?
Matt: Ah, well, this is part of your investigation roll, essentially.
Laura: Okay, okay.
Matt: Unless you want to track to where the tracks went, that's a different story. That's--
Laura: Well, can I see who was attacked first? Does it look like Kima was attacked, or she--
Matt: It's hard to tell, you see some of the footsteps, and some of the drag marks, while mostly worn over, elements do show some of the fairer folk. The duergar have a very distinct footprint or size. You do see one that resembles more of, like, gnomish or halfling origin. You see drag marks in the dirt, you see other individuals, looks like there were chunks of rock that have been chopped off the side of the wall that look fresh, where you can see the soot that has settled into this part of the cavern is no longer visible where these scratch marks basically took off and exposed fresh rock.
Laura: The drag marks, do they lead outside of the alcove and down?
Matt: They do, and they lead down the tunnel further.
Laura: Okay.
Travis: Let's go that way, or are we resting?
Laura: Do we need to rest? I mean--
Liam: I think we should rest.
Orion: I need to rest.
Laura: -- I feel like we need to get our spells back, otherwise we're just gonna get killed.
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Are we being chased right now?
Taliesin: Possibly.
Orion: Possibly.
Marisha: Are people hot on our tail?
Orion: Possibly.
Taliesin: We can rest in shifts.
Laura: Yeah. I guess that's the best thing to do.
Travis: I'll stay awake.
Liam: I'm totally fine at the moment, so I'll stay awake too.
Orion: Should I seal the tunnel?
Marisha: I need to sleep.
Laura: Maybe seal the tunnel behind us, yeah, so that--
Liam: Yes.
Laura: -- if they do come, they have to like, try to get through.
Ashley: I can stay, I can stay awake too, I'm okay.
Orion: Cool.
Ashley: So maybe everybody sleep--
Orion: So I do.
Matt: Okay. So you use your spell, you seal off the tunnel with pillars. You can just barely get most of the entranceway covered, there's a couple of small slivers and spaces between.
Orion: But we would sure hear them, if they were--
Laura: Trying to get through, yeah.
Matt: Yeah. If they were.
Laura: All right.
Matt: All right. So you guys end up making camp, are you guys lighting a fire? Or are you keeping it dark? What's your plan?
Travis: Yeah. I've got two firewood bundles in the bag of Ikea holding.
Taliesin: I don't think we need a fire.
Liam: I don't think it's a good idea.
Ashley: Do we need a fire?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: We're fine. It's warm down here.
Matt: It's fairly warm.
Liam: Yes.
Orion: Oh.
Travis: Then, no? (all laugh)
Liam: We've got Tiberius, if he's awake, can cast Light, let's just go into one of these tents.
Travis: I wanna burn something.
Laura: I know.
Marisha: Yeah, two to a tent.
Laura: You can keep burning a torch.
Marisha: We can each have our own tent! There's enough.
Laura: Stick it in the ground.
Travis: Is there anything made of wood down here?
Orion: I actually have to rest completely, so I can't do shifts.
Travis: I want to set it on fire.
Matt: Okay. Fair enough.
Orion: I need all my spell slots.
Marisha: I need to sleep as well.
Matt: What wood there is, is used charcoal in the abandoned fire pit, unfortunately.
Ashley: Yeah, but can you--
Travis: I wanted to pyro shit.
Matt: You guys get set up?
Liam: I pull out some dice, so that Grog and I can gamble while everyone are sleeping.
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: Fair enough.
Taliesin: How much does a rest heal? Out of curiosity?
Matt: A rest heals you to full.
Taliesin: Oh, excellent.
Laura: Oh, sweet! Yeah, let's fully rest.
Taliesin: Do I have time to do a quick engineering feat, as well?
Matt: You do not have--
Taliesin: Oh, okay. Never mind.
Matt: Like at this point, I mean, you could-- what're you trying to do? I should say.
Taliesin: Make an explosive arrow. I'm just in a mood.
Matt: Do you have any currently built explosives?
Taliesin: No, but I have gunpowder.
Matt: You know what, I'll let you go ahead and try it with just your tinker's kit--
Taliesin: Yeah.
Laura: Tinker's?
Matt: It's gonna be a difficult--
Taliesin: That's fine!
Matt: -- roll, but go for it.
Taliesin: What do I add? Am I just straight roll?
Matt: You add your proficiency bonus, which is, the tinker's kit is four.
Taliesin: Oh, okay. Proficiency bonus. 15?
Matt: 15? Okay, okay. You manage to fasten what appears to be a black powder, impact-based explosive to the tip of an arrow. It's a little weighty and unwieldy, it might not be the most accurate thing in the world, but if it hits it's probably gonna pack a punch.
Taliesin: Okay. I have another gift.
Laura: You do?
Taliesin: Explosive arrow!
Laura: This is the best day ever!
Taliesin: It's a bit iffy.
Liam: (Cary Elwes voice) Gently! Gently!
Orion: It's a bit iffy.
Laura: Gently!
Marisha: Don't trust it!
Taliesin: It's a bit iffy.
Laura: I gingerly put it in my quiver.
Orion: More like a shotgun.
Taliesin: It'll get better. It'll get better.
Travis: Can you make me an explosive axe?
Matt: You very gingerly place it within your quiver.
Laura: Oh god, all right.
Taliesin: I don't think you want an explosive axe.
Matt: It's heavy in the tip.
Travis: Why?
Matt: It's one of those things where, you know, shooting it is going to be an interesting challenge.
Laura: Should I keep it away from the rest of my stuff?
Matt: That's up to you!
Laura: Is there a possibility it could explode just--
Orion: You haven't even played with your hammer yet!
Matt: I dunno.
Taliesin: It's very unlikely to explode on by itself. 'Cause it needs to be moving at a high speed. But it's just not the best thing ever.
Laura: Maybe I won't keep it straight behind my head.
Taliesin: Yeah, no. Not straight behind.
Laura: Let's just kind of keep it down at my waist--
Liam: Off to the side.
Laura: With the dagger, maybe.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Is that cool?
Taliesin: The next one will be better.
Matt: All right.
Laura: All right. Did we all rest? Are we all rested?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: As the evening transpires, you all get your evenings of rest, you guys kind of keeping watch, gambling away. At a certain point, throughout the evening, something perks up your ears. You begin hearing footsteps, many footsteps.
Liam: Many footsteps.
Laura: (gasps) Oh no. How many is many? A lot.
Liam: How many does it sound like?
Matt: It sounds like anywhere between six, ten, more--
Liam: From, right, from up? Or down.
Matt: From above, yeah.
Liam: From above.
Travis: Up. Oh.
Laura: We should wake up.
Ashley: From above?
Travis: Like, the ceiling? Or--
Laura: Well like the-- no, no, no. From like--
Ashley: Like where you have the--
Laura: Up the path, right?
Matt: Up the path you guys came from.
Liam: Wait. Grog and I are the only ones awake, right?
Ashley: That he shielded off?
Orion: Yeah, it's sealed.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Yep.
Liam: Grog and I are the only ones awake.
Orion: Right.
Liam: Do we lay low, and hold quiet in these tents? Or do we get everyone up?
Laura: They're gonna know, 'cause we blocked off the friggin' path! I'm asleep. Sorry.
Liam: Yeah.
Ashley: I'm still awake.
Travis: Lay low. Let them come.
Liam: I think so.
Laura: (whispers) What? You're just really--
Travis: Keep sleeping and shut up!
Liam: No, no, no, I rouse my sister quietly.
Laura: What?
Travis: Oh. Fine.
Liam: She's in this tent.
Travis: Wake her up.
Laura: What's going--
Liam: (whispers) Quiet.
Matt: All right. Leaving the rest asleep?
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: I stealth.
Matt: The three of you make a stealth check.
Travis: I stealth as well.
Matt: You do, Grog. You do.
Laura: God damn.
Travis: Fuck yeah! A two!
Laura: I should stop rolling this fucking dice.
Travis: 17.
Ashley: Wait, are you guys asleep?
Liam: 23.
Marisha: I'm still passed out.
Laura: Oh! Yeah, that was a one. This, by the way--
Matt: Again?
Laura: -- was given to me by Wil Wheaton.
Travis: Yeah. Wake up your sister.
Laura: Thank you, Wil.
Travis: It was just us boys--
Matt: Thank you, Wil.
Travis: -- and then you woke her up.
Matt: All right, so--
Ashley: Wait, I was awake too.
Matt: You were awake too?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: At this point? You weren't resting?
Travis: What. You?
Laura: No, she was--
Travis: Oh, she was actually awake.
Ashley: Because I was, I was still at full--
Laura: (whispers) But you needed your spells.
Matt: Okay, then--
Ashley: Oh, but my spells? Actually--
Matt: If you're not resting you don't get your spells back.
Orion: Yeah, you need--
Ashley: -- I fell asleep! I totally forgot. I am sound asleep.
Marisha: Totally forgot I fell asleep!
Ashley: I was dreaming--
Travis: She dreamed, in the dream she was still awake.
Matt: You are welcome to stay awake if you want, but you just won't get your spells back.
Ashley: I was dreaming, it was real--
Matt: You'd probably be exhausted.
Ashley: -- I was so confused, by my dream.
Taliesin: You were just going all Inception on us.
Liam: You know, when you can't fall asleep--
Ashley: My perception was off.
Liam: -- and you're like, am I dreaming? Or is this the dream? Or is it real?
Taliesin: Spin the top. Spin the top.
Ashley: I was totally sleeping.
Liam: And you wake up, and you have to pee, it's hard to tell.
Ashley: And I spaced.
Travis: So the three of us are up.
Ashley: I was asleep.
Matt: All right. So. Between the three of you, thankfully, you had two successes against one failure. You manage to cover for your sister--
Liam: Shake it off.
Laura: Thank you, thank you.
Matt: -- who, who, 'Huh? What? What?'
Laura: Ah-- what? What?
Matt: When you wake her up.
Liam: Sh! Sh.
Matt: You guys quietly wait--
Travis: Oh no, that was a bad expression!
Liam: Daggers out! Daggers out!
Ashley: Or that was good?
Matt: All right. So.
Laura: Oh no. Did eyebrows go up?
Taliesin: (whistles In the Hall of the Mountain King)
Matt: The footsteps progress through, and you-- there's no light source, as duergar for the most part do not require light to see in the tunnels.
Laura: Can we see through the dark-- but we can see in the dark?
Matt: You guys have low-light vision, not dark vision.
Liam: Not dark vision.
Laura: There's no light in this area at all?
Travis: No! It's balls-ass dark!
Liam: There's no fire--
Matt: No, it is pitch black. You just hear--
Liam: On purpose no fire.
Matt: -- you just hear the footprints go by.
Travis: Good thing we didn't make a campfire!
Liam: Sh, sh!
Matt: You hear them approach the outskirts of the alcove.
Ashley: I have dark vision, gosh dang it!
Matt: But you're asleep.
Ashley: I'm fucking sleeping.
Matt: Yes, you are. (all laugh)
Ashley: Bad choices, all around!
Liam: They're going!
Matt: As the footsteps approach the outskirts of the alcove, the rest of you sleeping soundly, unaware of what's transpiring-- A few moments pass, and the footprints appear to be passing, past, downward into the tunnel. (all laugh)
Matt: Eventually, when the footfalls dissipate, and silence once again takes the camp, you breathe a sigh of relief and remove your hand from Vex's face.
Travis: Well, maybe just leave it there.
Liam: Last time I did that I got kicked in the nuts, very hard.
Travis: And liked it.
Matt: All right. So. Eventually, when you feel enough time has passed, where those who've been resting come from their sleep, spells recovered, wounds are healed, except for those who didn't sleep, you guys maintain the same health you had previously.
Ashley: What a good sleep I've had! I have all my spells back!
Matt: That also puts a level of exhaustion-- So. There is one level of exhaustion on both of you currently.
Liam: Sure. So what does that do to us?
Laura: Oh no.
Orion: Ah. You fools!
Matt: It just means any ability checks you take--
Liam: Yes.
Matt: So, any skills you take are at disadvantage until you get a full night's rest.
Travis: I'll take one more level two potion right now.
Liam: Skill? Skill. Okay.
Travis: One more level two potion.
Matt: Okay. You can use-- remember, you can use your hit dice to heal still, before you start throwing potions around. If you have a moment to rest--
Laura: Hit dice. We forgot about that because it wasn't there before.
Matt: Yeah. (sings) Fifth Edition! Before you start throwing potions around, 'cause remember, you're far away from civilization right now, you have a very limited number of potions now to lead you through here, unless you find some way to return to the surface.
Liam: Just for emergencies.
Orion: What's happening?
Liam: In combat.
Matt: So. You all eventually come back to consciousness, in this darkened alcove, pitch black. It is still warm, slight smell of soot and dust in the air, what do you guys want to do?
Liam: I have a question.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Outside of existence. Tiberius put up a stone, right?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Liam: But I didn't hear any (impact sounds), right?
Laura: Oh, no, he put it up next to our alcove. So, they just kind of passed by our alcove.
Matt: It basically matched the wall as you guys went around.
Liam: Oh. So we sealed ourselves into this little pocket?
Laura: Yes. We did.
Liam: Oh. We didn't even friggin' need to hide in the tent! We were in a little bubble of air!
Laura: Well, no, well, it's pillars, though, they could have--
Matt: You're not completely in there.
Laura: -- they could have seen us.
Liam: Okay.
Matt: He could block off most of it, there's like little spaces between--
Liam: Spaces. Okay. All right. Thank you.
Laura: I think we should all freshen up, since it's a new day!
Liam: Right. We're all healed, maybe-- Does anyone have to pee? Or perhaps--
Laura: Yeah, that.
Ashley: Yeah.
Laura: That.
Orion: Is anyone particularly dirty?
Laura: Intermission!
Matt: Indeed. So. This, given the point in time that you all wake from your slumber, we'll continue this in a few minutes. In the meantime, we're gonna go ahead and go to our intermission break. See you guys back here in about 12 minutes or so.
Marisha: Oh, cool.
Zac: So we're gonna update everyone real quick.
Matt: All right, what you got, man?
Zac: You guys can go, you guys can go.
Matt: Go, go!
Zac: Matt and I are gonna chat. Lucas, can you turn down all the other mics while they're exiting? (fart noises in background)
Zac: So guys, we already gave away one promo kit, so we reached our first goal.
Matt: Awesome. Fantastic.
Zac: That's one. I'm gonna bring out a poster for you guys to sign that we'll put inside the promo kit with it.
Matt: Perfect.
Zac: And we're actually pretty close to giving away our second promo kit. So, just so you guys know-- what the shit? If we get another 50, I think it's like 40 more, or 38 more? The number's on the bottom. We'll give away another promo kit, and these guys will all sign the poster that goes inside, and we'll get that shipped out to you as quickly as possible.
Matt: Yeah, do it.
Zac: That's pretty much the only update there. Oh, do you want to make a quick mention about the charity that you guys work with? Because we've been posting that in the chat room.
Matt: Yes, yes. Yes, 826LA, guys, is a charity that we've been been trying to raise money for. Essentially, it's a Los Angeles-based, also in San Francisco and other parts of the nation. It helps teach and tutor children in literacy, storytelling-- it's a really great charity. Go ahead and look on the website 826LA.com for any and all information you require on it. But they are a really good cause, they're good people, and been a fan of their work for a long time. So we are happy to help however we can and however you guys are able to help as well. So.
Zac: Great. If the mods want to post the command 'criticalrole', you guys can link to that charity and we'll go ahead and roll those videos so you guys can get updated on the characters, and we'll be back in a little bit.
Matt: See you guys in a little bit. [character intros]
Matt: Welcome back, guys. All right, I think everyone is sufficiently rested and bathroom breaked.
Laura: Yep.
Matt: And so we will pick it back up. So as you all regain consciousness and prepare yourselves for the day ahead, once again, you've gone a number of days without sunlight, without any vision of the sky. It's a very disorienting experience for all of you who are unfamiliar with subterranean territory. Even though you are rested, you don't feel rested. There's kinks in your back from the rocky floor. The best you could find yourself any sort of comfort here is from whatever you have on your back. Most of you sleep in your armor out of necessity and paranoia. As consciousness comes to you, you guys are able to try and find your way back out now that you've been sealed in.
Laura: Can we squish through the little cracks?
Matt: No.
Laura: We have to cut it down?
Matt: You have about a five, six-inch gap between each of them.
Laura: So we've gotta break our way out of here, Grog.
Travis: Oh, do I get to hit things?
Matt: You do.
Liam: Start smacking the wall.
Travis: My god.
Ashley: Can I just give it a try, just to see? Try make a dent.
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and make an athletics check.
Travis: And just to try it out, I would like bring out the flaming hammer of--
Matt: Actually, for this I would say it's a straight strength check. This is just physicality, strength against the stonework.
Liam: Might need to take your armor off.
Ashley: Strength is?
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Oh, it's right here.
Travis: 23.
Matt: All right.
Travis: With the hammer.
Ashley: Ten.
Marisha: We're playing pillar pinata.
Matt: All right, so as Pike-- as you go and swing at the pillar, you impact with all your might and the pillar cracks at the impact. You're like, 'that is awesome', then you look up a few inches and notice that Grog's ax is also in the same pillar.
Ashley: Oh. (all laugh)
Ashley: Yay teamwork, teamwork.
Travis: Yay, you loosened it up for me.
Ashley: Yeah I did!
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: (singing) That's fuckin' teamwork.
Ashley: Best pals!
Matt: You guys, you take five or six minutes or so. You manage to hack away enough in one of the pillars to leave enough room to squeeze through. It takes a while. You manage to cleave that open. You all gather your things, you group together and you can continue in whichever direction you wish.
Ashley: Down.
Travis: Yeah, we're going down.
Matt: All right, as you guys--
Laura: Stealth!
Liam: There are also some, I believe some duergar we didn't tell you--
Laura: Ahead of us.
Liam: Yes, while you were sleeping in the middle of the night, duergar walked-- I assume--
Laura: Dooragar?
Liam: Duraga.
Liam: (in odd accent) Duergar, some duergar walked down the passageway while you were sleeping.
Taliesin: Doo-agar.
Orion: Duragar.
Ashley: Dooagar.
Liam: But we thought it best to lay low and they went on.
Marisha: That's good.
Laura: Yes.
Liam: So, steady as she goes.
Laura: They might be ahead of us.
Taliesin: We should probably be quiet.
Marisha: Before we leave, I wanna go ahead and take a minute to meditate. If you guys can, you know, just watch while I meditate.
Taliesin: Oh god.
Laura: And lend our energy to you.
Marisha: Yes, if you guys could lend your positive energy it would be very helpful.
Travis: (fart sounds)
Marisha: So I can Commune With Nature.
Taliesin: I'll be out of the hole.
Marisha: I want to do Commune (pronouncing incorrectly) With Nature.
Matt: Commune? (pronouncing correctly)
Marisha: Yes, or Commune, whatever.
Matt: You wanna start a commune in nature?
Travis: Commune.
Marisha: Yeah, I want to start a commune in nature.
Taliesin: Commune in a commune.
Orion: Can we do that? How high is that roll again?
Marisha: Commune in commune in a commune.
Liam: Going the homeopathic route, I like it.
Marisha: That one.
Matt: Okay, keeping the best essence--
Taliesin: Oh god.
Matt: -- of the scenery around you, you take a moment. What's the reach of that one?
Marisha: Just read it, where is it?
Matt: Whatcha got?
Marisha: Three miles.
Matt: Three miles. The natural entities that you can sense in this cavern system are the few clusters of bats that exist in the back portion of the war camp that you guys just ran from. That's about it, I mean, there are a few other strange things that you've seen that live down here, but they wouldn't be anything that you would naturally sense.
Travis: What more do you see?
Marisha: Lots of bats. They're very nice bats
Travis: Well, that's good.
Orion: I love bats.
Marisha: Very pleasant, they're very friendly. That's about it.
Orion: Very good.
Laura: Bats.
Marisha: Bats.
Taliesin: Bats.
Marisha: Okay, carry on, let's go.
Travis: Oh, good.
Laura: All right.
Marisha: Thank you for your positive energy.
Laura: Nice.
Matt: All right, you guys step back into the tunnel, all of you squeezing through with the rest of your materials, heading further down. About 15 minutes of travel go by and the very air itself is becoming steadily warmer.
Taliesin: It's humid in here.
Matt: The smell is this combination of still water, groundwater type of a scent mixed with an ever-growing kind of sulfur-type, brimstone smell.
Liam: Smells like Grog.
Travis: I would like to trip Vax. (all laugh)
Liam: That was quick. (all laugh)
Travis: As he's walking.
Liam: I insult you and you trip me in a half a second? Would you like to take a shot at my nads as well?
Laura: You knew it was coming, as well.
Matt: Make an athletics check.
Travis: Yes! 24!
Matt: Make an acrobatics check.
Travis: Suck it, elf.
Liam: What goes around comes around, baby. 22.
Marisha: Ooh.
Matt: (impact sound) Face down, Vax.
Travis: Yes!
Matt: A slight bruise on the cheek as you go faceplanting into the stonework ahead of you.
Taliesin: For god's sake.
Liam: I'm going to voluntarily erase one hit point.
Travis: What, what happened? What happened? Did you not stealth past that little pebble?
Liam: It's all right, when the illithid general is bearing down on your walnut-sized brain--
Travis: Yeah?
Liam: I may be there, I may not.
Ashley: Hey! Don't be rude to him!
Laura: You guys, you guys.
Travis: Oh, I'm so happy right now.
Laura: These caverns are getting to us. (all laugh)
Matt: Clarota shuffles alongside you guys.
Liam: Right, everyone, we're getting slap-happy.
Laura: All right, all right, all right, let's call this.
Travis: That's all I wanted.
Ashley: Lack of oxygen.
Laura: We're going crazy down here.
Marisha: Grog, it's only 9 30 in the morning.
Orion: I feel fine.
Marisha: For christ's sake.
Matt: As you guys are walking, you're welcome to make chatter, any discussions you'd like.
Liam: That was a high acrobatics roll. I think the DM wanted me to eat shit.
Matt: No, it was yours versus his.
Travis: Yeah.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Oh, really? It was a direct contest?
Matt: It was a direct versus 24 versus 22. He won.
Liam: You still wanted me to eat shit.
Matt: No, it's up to the rolls, man.
Marisha: So wait, we get a chance to chat for a second?
Orion: Yes.
Marisha: Pike, did you ever fully tell us what all you saw in your vision? I mean, have you perhaps had any more visions?
Laura: Visions? You had a vision?
Ashley: I did, I did.
Laura: What?
Ashley: So, when I stayed away, I went to a shrine of Sarenrae, just to sorta see, 'cause I had a feeling that I'd been here, or something like that. So in this vision, I basically saw what we've been going through already.
Marisha: What?
Ashley: And what the soldier was talking about. So I saw something that was-- there was a single twisted horn of blackened soul matter.
Laura: Oh, soul matter?
Marisha: Soul matter?
Taliesin: Oh.
Liam: Sounds dirty.
Ashley: It was a point of concentrated evil.
Orion: Oh.
Laura: This horn?
Ashley: Yes.
Marisha: Concentrated evil.
Orion: Nasty horn.
Ashley: And it was so strong that I couldn't stay in the vision, because I could feel that it was taking over, so I pulled me out of the dream, among various things. But I saw--
Marisha: Like the horn of Sauron?
Ashley: The horn of Sauron, is what it said.
Orion: Is that your cousin?
Liam: Did you see any whales?
Laura: The horn of--
Ashley: I didn't see whales.
Liam: No whales.
Laura: Okay, no narwhals.
Marisha: No whales, no narwhals.
Laura: The horn of K'varn, yes?
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Okay.
Marisha: Horn of evil.
Ashley: I some visions of where sort of-- 'Cause I kind of went in past and then got to this thing. So I guess depending on where we are--
Laura: Can you lead in the direction to go?
Ashley: Yes, if I see things that are familiar. Such as-- (all laugh)
Ashley: I went past a jagged onyx-colored fortress framed in molten rock.
Liam: Oh.
Laura: I think that probably--
Marisha: The place we're heading.
Laura: The place we're going to.
Ashley: Yes.
Liam: That sounds creepy
Ashley: Past a field of broken glass and bone.
Orion: Right.
Marisha: We haven't seen that. Oh no.
Travis: Obsidian, maybe?
Ashley: Yeah.
Taliesin: Or just melted sand.
Travis: I mean, whatever that is.
Ashley: And the prettiest was into a cavern of blue crystal, where a fungal fortress--
Laura: A fungal fortress?
Marisha: Ooh.
Ashley: -- sort of entwined an ancient city of marble and jade--
Orion: Three different places.
Liam: That sounds really shitty.
Laura: Did the blue gemstones look valuable?
Marisha: It sounds amazing, that doesn't sound shitty.
Matt: As you start to mention that now, Clarota kind of nods and says,
Liam: It feels a bit-- broken glass.
Matt: "Aye, that's where the colony resides."
Laura: Your colony?
Matt: "Our great city."
Liam: In which of those places? In the--
Laura: In the fungal city.
Liam: Fungal.
Matt: "Amongst the ruins of jade and glass."
Laura: (whispers) Jade.
Orion: Is that where we should go?
Marisha: That's Yug'Voril?
Matt: "Surrounded by the forest."
Marisha: That's Yug'Voril?
Matt: "The city below Yug'Voril, that is where the temple resides, where K'varn holds the Elder Brain."
Laura: Ah.
Orion: Ah, this is where we need to go, I'm assuming.
Matt: "Ah, yes."
Liam: He sounds like a real fun-guy.
Travis: Oh god. (all groan)
Taliesin: Trip him again, trip him again.
Marisha: Trip him again!
Liam: I'm a dad. (all laugh)
Laura: So I bet the fortress--
Matt: Make a will saving throw. (all laugh)
Ashley: Oh my god.
Liam: What is that? Wisdom?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: 12.
Matt: Okay, you feel a mental slap as Clarota glares at you from across the tunnel. "There'll be none of that in my presence."
Travis: You got bitch-slapped.
Matt: "I hate puns." (all laugh)
Travis: (high-pitched voice) I hate puns.
Liam: Noted, noted.
Laura: So I bet, first fortress you saw, I bet the one of obsidian was where--
Liam: Percy's losing his shit.
Orion: There's a bathroom right over there, Percy.
Laura: -- where Lady Kima is being held.
Ashley: I think--
Laura: I bet that's the one, because he mentioned molten lava or something. So she's being held there and then further in is K'varn.
Ashley: Yeah.
Orion: So get there, get K'varn.
Matt: "Yes, Emberhold, yes."
Laura: Emberhold, yes. Is that an obsidian fortress?
Matt: "It is black and jagged, I think, yes."
Laura: Well, let's keep going that way.
Marisha: So the ultimate question is, are we heading the right way? Are we heading the right way, Pike, do you know?
Ashley: Can I perception check? (all laugh)
Matt: You guys are unfamiliar with this tunnel, Clarota is unfamiliar with this tunnel. All you know is it's going down. That's better than up.
Ashley: I feel like that's the way we need to go.
Laura: So, just keep going, then?
Taliesin: Let's keep going.
Travis: Do I need to take off running again?
Laura: No.
Ashley: I think basically we need to go down, 'cause if we go up that means we're going out.
Laura: Yeah, let's keep going.
Travis: We can go--
Matt: You guys press forward and you begin to encounter little trickles on the ceiling of orange, glowing little puddles.
Laura: Avoid that!
Marisha: If we learned anything from Minecraft-- (all laugh)
Laura: Don't touch that.
Matt: Progressing further down, you start seeing large clusters, little pools of molten rock beginning to form under certain sections. In a little ways up, you begin hearing some additional footsteps to your own. Further down the tunnel.
Laura: Oh. Can we stealth, can we stealth? And my favored terrain is the Underdark.
Matt: It is.
Laura: I don't know what that means, though. (all laugh)
Laura: No, no, no, I know. But I don't know what favored terrain gives me, because I tried to look it up and couldn't find it.
Ashley: You just love it.
Laura: Does it give me an advantage?
Matt: Here, there's a sheet that has all the information you need.
Laura: Oh good, thank you.
Orion: By the way, I take one of the earrings from Scanlan and give it to Grog. So Grog, now you've got one of the--
Travis: I've got an earring?
Matt: Scanlan is not happy about this.
Orion: Well? He's not saying anything.
Liam: Everyone, there's footsteps coming from ahead. Let Vex'ahlia and I scout ahead. Wait for a moment.
Laura: Yes, okay. Let's go.
Matt: Stealth checks, both of you.
Laura: Yes, finally.
Liam: 22 for me.
Matt: All right.
Laura: The same for me, actually. Twinsies. Sorry.
Matt: All right, so you guys vanish into the darkness best as you can tell, kind of weaving between the portions of the tunnel that naturally shift and give you moments where you can hide up inside. As you guys hold back, you guys push ahead, and you can see the little points of glowing light where these lava pools every 100 or so feet begin to appear. You begin listening out, and you hear these footfalls are very heavy, and the gait of whoever is walking seems to be wider than that of the normal humanoid.
Travis: Ah, let me play. Please.
Liam: Well it's definitely not duergar. How far ahead of us do they sound?
Laura: Can we see it?
Matt: Probably a good 60, 70 feet. You hear some muttering.
Laura: Can I understand what they're saying?
Matt: No.
Liam: I'm listening, trying to make out how many sets of footsteps I can hear.
Laura: And I look on the ground and see if I can find multiple sets of footsteps as well.
Matt: Looking on the ground, you guys have no light source currently. It's pitch black.
Liam: But there's lava spilling and we can see in dim light.
Matt: Do you want to go to the nearest lava pool? All right. It's very, very faint visual. You can see there are a number of tracks, up and down. All different sizes. This area, this tunnel is traversed quite a lot. Listening, you hear two sets of heavy footsteps. And you hear what sounds like some sort of squeak sound, like a (squeaks).
Travis: Shit.
Liam: Cart. Could be some sort of device--
Matt: From around the edge, you can just barely make out these two lumbering humanoid shapes.
Liam: Can we tell what they are?
Laura: Oh, he's trying to see if they're seeing us.
Liam: Yes.
Matt: They begin to step towards your direction.
Laura: We back away.
Matt: You guys back and kind of flatten yourself against the wall.
Liam: Separate sides.
Matt: You can see they're now both dragging behind them this small roughshod cart, with something inside it.
Laura: We string a rope across the tunnel.
Matt: Okay, you pull it across.
Marisha: Oh, yeah!
Matt: (deep grumbling and laughter)
Liam: I also yank my serpentine belt off--
Laura: Oh!
Liam: And throw it out, right under the rope.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: What does that do?
Liam: Snake.
Matt: So, as he throws the leather, the leather shifts form suddenly in midair into a serpent that slips onto the ground, and slithers in place, curling up at the approaching two monolithic entities.
Laura: That is stupid.
Liam: Yes, it is.
Laura: This is gonna go really poorly.
Matt: As they begin to cross in front of you, you both pull taut on the rope.
Laura: This is dumb.
Matt: The immediate one falls forward, tripping face-first on the ground, a heavy (impact sound). You guys hear in the distance this loud thud, impact sound.
Laura: And we call, I go, Grog!
Travis: I'm raging.
Liam: And I leap out, daggers at the fallen one.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: Run!
Matt: You guys come rushing in, let's go ahead and roll initiative.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: I raged.
Matt: I figured you were raging.
Travis: Well, you know, when the ladies call my name.
Taliesin: That sucks.
Marisha: That's not too bad, could be worse.
Orion: Yes, sounds good.
Marisha: What are we fighting? What are we fighting?
Laura: I know, right? Oh god, here we go.
Marisha: What are we fighting, we don't know.
Laura: Oh! Lava pools.
Taliesin: Lava pools.
Marisha: Lava pools, Lava pools.
Travis: Wow.
Ashley: Wow.
Marisha: Grog, you better be throwing bitches into that lava.
Travis: Last time I tried to do somebody to something, I did it to myself, so.
Liam: Hashtag bitches in lava?
Marisha: Hashtag bitches in lava!
Matt: You guys, coming in this way.
Marisha: Bitches in lava, bitches in lava.
Ashley: Oh god!
Laura: Oh god!
Orion: She's excited about the lava.
Liam: I got 99 problems and a troll ain't one.
Laura: Are they trolls, are they ogres?
Matt: They are two giant ogres.
Laura: Oh, god, one's on the ground.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Laura: It's huge, these are really big.
Matt: One is back here and one's just fallen over there.
Ashley: Holy cow.
Matt: And they are carrying some sort of large cart-like object, I'll just say for now.
Laura: This is so dumb, why did we do this?
Taliesin: This is a d20.
Matt: Let's say it's about there. All right.
Travis: What's in the cart?
Matt: So, initiative order, guys?
Laura: Do we get the surprise at all?
Matt: You do, actually! I'm rolling initiative, so we have the order. You guys are gonna have a full round of surprise on them first.
Laura: Okay, cool.
Matt: All right, so, 25 to 20?
Laura: Oh, man, really?
Matt: 20 to 15?
Orion: 19.
Laura: 15.
Liam: 15.
Orion: I got scared and I cast Stoneskin immediately.
Ashley: Cast what?
Orion: Stoneskin.
Matt: So Vex and Vax, both at 15?
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: 15, yeah.
Liam: Oh!
Laura: Oh!
Matt: 15 to ten?
Taliesin: 13.
Marisha: 13 as well.
Ashley: 11.
Laura: Oh no, Grog, what did you roll?
Travis: I farted when I rolled, I rolled a 9.
Matt: Oh! Grog.
Ashley: Greg.
Orion: How much does the ogre weigh? Or the ogres, as you said?
Matt: The ogres, each one weighs nearly a ton.
Travis: Oh, shit, really?
Laura: Oh, they're huge.
Travis: So, like, 200 pounds.
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Yes.
Liam: Yes, exactly.
Matt: Yes, Grog, close to that.
Laura: Yes, Grog.
Matt: All right, let's go fast here. Here we go. All right, so, top of the round-- No! Surprise round for both of you guys first, as the rest of you rush in, so Vex and Vax, you guys get a surprise round.
Laura: Awesome.
Liam: I'm already jumping in the air, so I'm gonna go.
Matt: To the guy on the ground.
Liam: Okay, and this, since it's a surprise, it's automatic crit?
Matt: Yes!
Laura: Oh, nice.
Marisha: Hell, yeah!
Matt: He's on the ground, so you get advantage on your attack rolls.
Liam: Okay, okay, all right, so that's 28.
Matt: That definitively hits.
Liam: Yeah, 1d4 for-- this is my poison dagger. Two, eight, okay, I'm doing my Sneak Attack damage, here we go, four, nine, 12, 18, yeah, 23. Total for that, 62 points of damage.
Matt: 62 points of damage.
Laura: Wow.
Matt: You leap on and entirely eviscerate the ogre. You jumped onto his back, slashing the back of his torso. As you pull open the flesh, you expose the back of the ribcage, and he goes into this kind of gurgling sound as it dies immediately on the spot.
Laura: Oh, what?
Marisha: Oh, what?
Ashley: Oh, what?
Liam: And I use my bonus action to hide.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Do you wanna talk to the other one, since--
Laura: 62.
Matt: Okay, roll and make a stealth check.
Liam: Natural 20.
Orion: Nice.
Matt: All right.
Liam: See you later, motherfuckers.
Matt: The ogre is right there. There is the ogre on the ground, big squishy ogre.
Laura: What?
Travis: Big squishy ogre.
Matt: It's considered rough terrain, because now you have to go over this giant dead body in the middle of the-- All right, your turn.
Laura: I Hunter's Mark him, and I'm gonna shoot him with the explosive arrow.
Taliesin: Yeah!
Travis: I like it.
Laura: So I'm gonna see if it hits. I'm gonna use the blazing bowstring. That's a 22.
Matt: 22 definitely hits.
Laura: Okay. Also, blazing bowstring that gives me a plus d10. So, okay, 14 plus d10, wait, that's a ten? Yeah!
Liam: That's a ten.
Laura: Plus 19 and then Hunter's Mark! Plus six!
Liam: Ah yes!
Matt: 25.
Laura: 25, plus whatever the explosive damage is.
Matt: So! As you pull the arrow out, it's a little wonky, it's actually, what you rolled, it's a minus four penalty to hit with it, but you still manage to hit because it's a big creature, even though it's in very big darkness, you-- you know, in darkness you ignore partial cover.
Laura: Right!
Liam: Bellybutton.
Matt: You fire it. It arcs slightly, smacks in the side of its chest and stomach area. It's this cacophonous explosion sound that rocks the immediate vicinity.
Taliesin: Whoa! Yes!
Travis: Yes!
Matt: It takes an additional 2d8 points of explosive damage.
Marisha: Ooh!
Taliesin: Yeah!
Orion: Nice.
Matt: Nine points, and everything around it also takes the additional damage--
Laura: Oh shit!
Matt: -- the whole radius does.
Laura: Oh, I hope I didn't blow up the cart.
Matt: The cart-- the wood on the wheels had shatters and breaks, it falls to one side. What you see, some sort of a glass container that was at the back of the cart shatters and cracks.
Laura: (gasps) Oh no.
Marisha: Oh.
Taliesin: I'm still happy.
Laura: Welp?
Liam: Still pretty cool, still pretty cool.
Marisha: Collateral damage. It's bound to happen.
Matt: Top of the round. Tiberius.
Laura: Oh, and can I move away?
Matt: You can move if you want. Yeah.
Laura: Yeah, I move back.
Matt: Back to here?
Laura: Yeah. Sounds good.
Travis: Where's your pointer?
Matt: Use your pointer if you need it.
Laura: Oh right! Well, there.
Matt: All right. Tiberius, you're up first.
Orion: Very good! I'll take a few steps forward and be like, well, this is poppycock! And I'll shoot a Scorching Ray right at the dude.
Matt: All right, go for it, roll for the attack.
Laura: Does anybody speak Ogre? Nobody speaks Ogre, though. We can't talk to him.
Travis: No.
Liam: They're dumber than Grog is.
Orion: So what am I rolling?
Matt: Do you ignore partial cover?
Orion: Oh! Like can I just in general?
Matt: I mean, did you take that feat?
Orion: No.
Matt: No. Okay. So yeah. So you're rolling-- okay, so yeah. So what did you roll to hit?
Orion: I rolled all three at once. 'Cause I have to do one for each.
Matt: Right, yeah.
Orion: So I got a 12, a 13, and a 12.
Matt: Okay. All three rays unfortunately miss--
Orion: Damn it!
Matt: -- due to the darkness in this room it's very hard to see, other than the slight glow from the lava. So you fire all three rays, and you see them streak through, and each one gives off just enough light from the actual flaming ray to glow to the vicinity, but not the actual target. You see them both streak off and slam the wall on the opposite side.
Orion: Wait, do I add my dex on those?
Matt: You add your spell modifier.
Orion: (whispers) What's my spell modifier?
Matt: It's on top of your spell page!
Orion: Oh! Oh, no, I'm sorry, 20-- plus nine on all that.
Matt: Good to know.
Orion: Yeah, sorry.
Matt: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: There you go.
Orion: Okay, first one does five--
Matt: It's his first time casting spells, guys. (mouths) It's not.
Travis: Yeah.
Orion: -- plus five, ten! I rarely do this one, kids.
Liam: It's part of his charm.
Orion: Ten on the first one.
Matt: All right.
Orion: 17 on the second one. And 17 on the second one.
Laura: He's so dead!
Matt: Okay, is there a saving throw for half damage?
Orion: No! I mean, 12 on the third one.
Matt: Is there a saving throw on this one, or is it just straight damage?
Orion: Yeah, straight damage.
Matt: Okay, cool, gotcha. All right.
Orion: Yes!
Matt: All right, so you, you blast the ogre with three. As each explosion hits, you see the rippling of its kind of grotesque flesh from the impact, the third one blasting off a portion of its shoulder, exposing this meaty bone and blood. It gives out this horrible (roars) into the tunnel itself, causing just the atmosphere to shake, as bits of stone begin to rumble and fall from the ceiling. All right, that ends your turn?
Orion: Yeah!
Matt: Still standing. Barely. It's now its turn.
Laura: (gasps)
Matt: It steps away.
Liam: (whispers) You can't see me.
Laura: Over the dead body of his brethren.
Matt: To that point. It's just going to charge through, as all it can see is the figures in the distance.
Marisha: Pick me.
Matt: That's where it is. At which point, the cart seems to shift slightly.
Travis: Oh shit.
Laura: Oh no, what did we do?
Liam: Oh dear, something's coming out of the jar.
Marisha: What did we open?
Laura: Oh, god. We let something out.
Matt: You can see something slowly-- dark something--
Orion: I thought it was going to be a good thing!
Matt: -- amorphous and liquid in nature beginning to shift in the shadow.
Marisha: Oh, great.
Laura: Does it-- Oh no-- Is it on fire so we can see--
Liam: No.
Laura: -- is it on fire so we can see what it is?
Matt: No.
Liam: No.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Laura: The cart wasn't on fire?
Liam: It's dangerous! It's dangerous! It's fucking dangerous!
Matt: It's just this giant, black, liquid--
Marisha: What is that?
Matt: -- ooze-like creature.
Liam: It's black ooze. It's dangerous!
Marisha: We just opened Pandora's box.
Laura: This is really, really bad!
Liam: It's fucking dangerous.
Laura: I'm sorry I exploded it.
Marisha: Great. That's good. Good.
Liam: Stay away from it. Stay away from it. Stay away from it.
Travis: So go wrestle it?
Ashley: So go jump in it, is what you're saying.
Liam: French kiss that shit!
Travis: It's mine!
Laura: (whispers) Don't attack it.
Travis: Don't attack it?
Laura: I'm scared of it.
Marisha: Black ooze.
Liam: Ranged attacks.
Matt: All right.
Laura: What does a black ooze do?
Liam: Fire and ranged attacks.
Marisha: How do I handle that?
Matt: So! That brings us to--
Taliesin: Fire?
Liam: Think!
Matt: Scanlan. Scanlan.
Laura: Oh no, oh god, Scanlan.
Matt: I know you're out there, Scanlan.
Laura: Do something amazing, Scanlan!
Liam: Sing, Sam! Sing!
Matt: Scanlan's going to go ahead and sing a song of inspiration to-- I'd say Grog just in case he needs to-
Taliesin: (sings) When we have to fight the ooze, you'll never have to lose.
Travis: What?
Laura: You received an inspiration.
Travis: Oh good, yeah, thank you. It's an eight, right?
Matt: Yeah, it's a d8 inspiration dice.
Laura: I want some food. I'm so hungry.
Liam: (sings) We're up all night in the dark, we're up all night in the dark.
Taliesin: (sing) We're up all night in the dark.
Marisha: (sing) We're up all night in the dark.
Orion: Is that what Sam would do?
Matt: Scanlan is then going to cast Invisibility on himself as an immediate self-sustaining reaction.
Liam: Oh shit, the music! The music!
Matt: That brings us to Vex!
Laura: Me?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: Ranged attack, ranged attack.
Laura: Okay, on the thingie?
Marisha: Pew pew.
Orion: Take out the ogre first.
Laura: Okay. Well I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the black ooze!
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Sounds good.
Laura: Okay. Which--
Matt: So you Lightning Arrow.
Laura: Yes, I do. Okay. Oh, and, oh, the other-- never mind, that other guy's still Hunter's Marked. Okay.
Marisha: Well, yeah.
Liam: Hit it, hit it, hit it.
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Liam: Yes, it is!
Laura: That's a 19 plus-- that's a regular attack bonus, right?
Liam: It's a crit.
Laura: Was it?
Liam: Isn't 19-20 crit? That's just for me.
Matt: No, that's just for you.
Laura: That's just for you, yo.
Matt: Yeah, so that hits.
Laura: Okay. So.
Marisha: What if it's like a sentient alien lifeform?
Ashley: This music is so stressful!
Laura: Okay, 4d8 of lightning damage.
Marisha: You know, like some Spiderman shit.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the arrow damage.
Marisha: Some alien lifeform shit.
Taliesin: Well, we should kill it.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Marisha: Yeah.
Laura: Just kidding, I'm just so excited! 11.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay. And the 4d8 of lightning damage.
Matt: As the arrow disappears into its form--
Laura: No.
Matt: -- the bolt of energy, as you pull out the arrow and release it, it sparks and you can see the blue energy kind of streaking behind the arrow. It plunges into this thick, black, gooey mass and as it does, the lightning just gets absorbed into its form.
Travis: Oh, shit balls.
Matt: It sits for a second, shakes and quivers, and then splits.
Marisha: Oh! No.
Laura: Splits?
Liam: Yeah, it splits into smaller ones. Smaller sizes.
Matt: Dividing into two separate smaller slimes.
Taliesin: No!
Laura: What is this thing?
Matt: Seemingly unaffected by the damage of the lightning. Other than the fact that you altered its form slightly.
Laura: Great. Cool. Awesome.
Matt: So, do you wish to move?
Laura: Oh, yeah! I back the eff up. Actually, should-- yeah, yeah. I'm gonna back up. To there sounds good.
Matt: All right! That brings us to-- Vax, you're up.
Liam: All right, I'm gonna run up to the back of Tall and Ugly, and try to stab him. I'm gonna do the reach-around again, and try to stab him in the eyes.
Orion: The ol' reach-around.
Ashley: The ol' reach-around.
Liam: And I'm hidden-- I'm stealth already, I think, right?
Orion: Courteous!
Matt: You are, yes.
Travis: It's like his character move.
Taliesin: The stealthy reach-around.
Travis: Action figure Vax'ahlia.
Liam: So the first attack is an 18.
Taliesin: The stealthy reach-around.
Laura: That's Vax'ildan.
Matt: Hits.
Travis: Sorry. Vax'ildan.
Liam: Okay, Sneak Attack, here we go.
Travis: The signature reach-around move!
Liam: For the eyeballs. Two plus seven is--
Laura: I'm sorry I let the ooze loose.
Taliesin: It's okay.
Liam: 40. 52.
Matt: 52. As you reach behind, the daggers plunge into it, and the ogre lumbering over doesn't have any more to its life. Its jaw just goes slack as it releases the last bit of air in its lungs, tumbling forward, piling onto his friend.
Liam: As it does, I want to use my bonus action to spring off his shoulders towards my friends.
Matt: Okay. Okay.
Laura: That's good.
Matt: This direction? All right, go ahead and make an acrobatics check.
Liam: Sure.
Laura: Over the lava pit.
Travis: Kill it.
Laura: Don't fall in the lava pit.
Liam: That's a 15.
Matt: 15, okay. You barely manage to catch your footing. Thank god you didn't roll a one. That would've been very bad. This ogre then plummets to the ground, now piling on top of his friend.
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: So now that whole section there is considered rough terrain. All right, that brings us to Percy!
Taliesin: Okay, I'm going to try something weird, here.
Travis: Oh no.
Taliesin: Where am I? Okay. I'm going to step forward and to the right a bit. Just sort of joining this little-- like getting right in here. And I'm going to try and shoot, and this is gonna sound weird, but as I'm running I'm going to-- Actually, back me up to about there.
Matt: There?
Taliesin: I'm going to try and shoot about right here, I'm gonna try and unleash the lava to send the lava-- to see if I can get it to start flowing towards. Does that make sense?
Matt: I will tell you, the pool of lava right there isn't brimming really close to the surface.
Taliesin: Oh, it's just down?
Matt: It would take a significant impact to carve anything that would release it.
Taliesin: Okay, well--
Matt: It's self-contained.
Taliesin: -- I've come forward enough, I'm gonna take a shot at one of these guys, then.
Matt: Okay. This one, or this one?
Taliesin: That one.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and roll for attack--
Taliesin: I'm gonna try something else. I'm gonna try an ice shot.
Matt: Ice shot. Okay.
Taliesin: 15?
Matt: 15?
Liam: (sneezes dramatically)
Laura: Bless you.
Matt: 15 hits!
Taliesin: Oh my god. All right, and that's a--
Travis: 15 hits.
Laura: 15 hits.
Travis: Let's just take it.
Laura: Well, what else are we gonna do with it?
Taliesin: -- that's 15 points of damage, plus six points of ice damage.
Matt: Okay. The bullet pierces his form. You can see a part of its gelatinous, physical structure quiver. The ice explosion, you see go off, and just get absorbed into the gelatinous form.
Marisha: Fuck.
Taliesin: Fuck!
Matt: Seemingly unaffected by the additional damage. That's your first shot. You get two shots, don't you?
Taliesin: That's right. Oh, good god.
Marisha: But it didn't split, right?
Matt: Nope.
Orion: Nope.
Marisha: That's cool. It's a perk.
Taliesin: Yeah, no, that's-- Okay. I'm going to attempt to-- Is there any loose-looking rocks that are up above? Or is there anything that looks like, if I gave it a push, would fall down, from up above?
Matt: This tunnel looks pretty, at this point, pretty cleanly carved out.
Laura: What about the areas I exploded?
Matt: Over there? I mean, there's parts of the rock, but the explosion was more damaging to things that were fragile--
Laura: Okay, okay.
Matt: -- the stonework is pretty solid.
Taliesin: I'm gonna take another shot at the same one and see what happens.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Taliesin: 20, that hits.
Matt: Yep! Damage.
Taliesin: Not a lot. That's seven points of damage.
Matt: Okay. Gotcha. Both shots into it. You see its form kind of quiver at the impact, but it's still slowly slithering forward. Now comes to Keyleth!
Marisha: Okay. I wanna move, kind of be like, whoops, sorry, 'scuse me, pardon me, and come like heresies. Would you say that I'm 30 feet away from that guy?
Matt: Just barely. Like, he's just in the cusp of 30 feet from you.
Marisha: Will my Thorn Whip reach him? My 30-foot-range Thorn Whip?
Matt: You can certainly try!
Marisha: I'm gonna try and Thorn Whip him!
Matt: Okay!
Liam: (Cosby voice) You see, the black goo thing--
Matt: What's the Thorn Whip do?
Liam: -- is not so easy to kill. (all laugh)
Marisha: Huh?
Matt: What's the Thorn Whip do? Read the spell for me.
Ashley: Too soon?
Laura: Too soon?
Marisha: Well, it does 2d6 damage, it's a 30-foot range, and it pulls 10 feet. Notes I have on it-- Okay-- piercing damage-- if they are large or smaller, you pull the creature up to ten feet closer.
Matt: What type of damage is it?
Marisha: Piercing.
Matt: Okay. Gotcha. All right. So, you hit, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: I hit. I don't hit. That's funny. Okay.
Matt: You rolled a 20, right?
Marisha: I didn't roll yet.
Matt: Oh, you didn't roll yet. Sorry.
Marisha: No.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll to hit.
Marisha: What do I add, my spell modifier?
Matt: Yep.
Marisha: 18.
Matt: Yeah, you hit.
Laura: Woo!
Ashley: Woo!
Matt: So, go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: 19, sorry, it's actually 19.
Matt: That still hits! It doesn't move very fast, it's a little easy to hit.
Laura: Okay, that's good.
Matt: All right, takes its damage.
Marisha: One piercing damage, but I pull him ten feet closer to me. Does he go into the lava?
Matt: Gets pushed just ever so slightly into the hole. As it does, you can see this blackish steam and smoke begin to billow up from where it hits, and it (growls).
Laura: Good!
Matt: -- begins to quiver as you're kind of yanking it back with the Thorn Whip.
Liam: What was that sound it made again?
Matt: (growls) (all laugh)
Matt: It takes 2d10 points of damage--
Laura: Woo!
Matt: -- from the impact of the lava. That's an additional 17 points of fire damage to it.
Taliesin: That's nice.
Liam: Yes!
Laura: Fire damage!
Ashley: Nice!
Liam: Aw, yes!
Laura: Kill it with fire!
Marisha: And I've got him on a leash now.
Liam: Burn it!
Matt: You do. Is it considered grappled?
Marisha: Nope.
Matt: Then that would be the end of the attack. The spell dissipates after that.
Marisha: Oh, okay.
Matt: You've gotta do it again the next turn.
Marisha: Okay.
Liam: Hey, that was pretty good.
Laura: Yep.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn, Pike, you're up!
Ashley: Okay. So, question. I want to use something I think that I can use called-- this may be stupid, so I have another option if this is dumb.
Travis: That's what it's called?
Laura: (laughs)
Ashley: Yes.
Orion: That's a weird spell!
Liam: So long!
Ashley: Something called 'Insect Plague'.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Ooh, yeah!
Ashley: Which you can use as a ranged attack in a 20-foot-radius sphere?
Matt: Yes. So, you do it at range, and it creates a 20-foot radius that does this.
Ashley: Okay, and then it's a 1d10-- creature takes 4d10 piercing damage-- oh, on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Cool! So there's that, yeah.
Liam: Very Old Testament!
Ashley: So, I think--
Matt: Do you wanna move--
Laura: Yeah, do it!
Ashley: Okay, you know, let's give it a try!
Laura: And then we can see what it does to creatures within its zone!
Matt: Where do you wanna go, girl?
Ashley: Okay, so, where am I? I'm sorry, I can't see.
Matt: You're right over here. It's your gold base.
Ashley: So, where do I need to be to do it-- like over here?
Liam: Get closer.
Laura: Maybe up next to the ogre dead.
Liam: Gotta run up.
Matt: Okay. One, two, three, four. That's about as close as you can get there, yeah.
Ashley: Okay. So can I still get it there?
Matt: Yeah, you can cast it. Where do you want to put the radius?
Ashley: Are these all five?
Orion: Yeah.
Matt: These are all five-foot squares.
Ashley: Okay, so can I--
Liam: I'd just like to point out, this is like the Avengers trailer, where all the heroes run out and jump at the same time. (all laugh)
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Yeah. Yeah, you can get these both from there.
Ashley: Okay, so I'll try to get them both.
Matt: Okay, all right, so--
Ashley: So then ten.
Matt: So you go ahead and roll the damage.
Ashley: Okay, so how-- Wait, how many do I roll, again? At fifth level?
Matt: You're casting this as a fifth-level spell?
Ashley: Well, maybe I shouldn't--
Matt: It's up to you.
Laura: Yeah, do it.
Ashley: Okay, I'll do it.
Liam: Do it, do it, try it.
Ashley: But do I save a healing?
Liam: Do it.
Laura: Go for it, Pike.
Liam: Come on, you're a warrior.
Matt: It's up to you, Pike. You do what you gotta do.
Ashley: Okay, so-- Cool, one.
Laura: Ten.
Liam: Ten.
Ashley: Ten, 11.
Laura: 18.
Ashley: 19.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: So how many do I roll? That was three--
Matt: It gets to make a saving throw to see if it gets half damage.
Ashley: So I roll another one then--
Laura: Yeah, four. She gets four.
Matt: What's--
Ashley: I roll, I roll four. Hold on. 19.
Laura: 25.
Liam: 25.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: Okay, what's the DC? What's your spell DC at the top of your spell sheet?
Ashley: Eight plus-- Or-- No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Matt: DC should be--
Ashley: 16.
Liam: That's better.
Matt: 16, okay, one makes its save, the other doesn't.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: So what's the total damage?
Laura: 25.
Ashley: 25.
Matt: Okay, so one takes 25, one takes 13.
Orion: Cool.
Taliesin: Wow.
Matt: Piercing damage. Got it. And, just, insects appear in the area, doing that much damage. Does that stay? Or does that go away at the end of your turn?
Ashley: Let's see here.
Matt: What's the duration?
Ashley: Concentration. Up to ten minutes.
Matt: So you can keep it there if you want to.
Laura: Ooh.
Ashley: I'll just keep it.
Matt: It just does damage every turn to everything in that radius.
Ashley: Awesome, let's just keep it.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'm just really concentrating.
Matt: That ends your turn. Grog, you're up.
Travis: Right, I would like to pull the flaming hammer out of the bag of holding.
Laura: Yeah.
Travis: And I would like to run at the-- this little-- this guy.
Orion: No, you'll get in the insect cloud.
Travis: What?
Orion: You'll get in the insect cloud.
Matt: All right. One, two, three, four.
Laura: Stay away from the insect cloud.
Travis: I forgot there was an insect cloud.
Matt: Five, six, seven, eight. That's as far as you can get, currently.
Travis: Oh, because there are bodies in the way?
Matt: Because of the rough terrain, and you have to jump over the bodies to get there.
Laura: Wait, but my natural ability--
Travis: Then if that's as far as I can get, I would like to take the hooded lantern I have out of the bag of holding and throw it--
Laura: Difficult terrain does not slow my group's travel when this is my favored terrain.
Marisha: Ooh! (all cheer)
Travis: Yes!
Matt: Nice one. Boom, boom, boom. So you just go charging up overtop the ogre bodies, leaping, coming down with the-- hammer, you said?
Travis: Yes, with the flaming hammer.
Liam: Oh man, you the real MVP.
Travis: -- activating the flaming properties of rage, and urine, and death.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: Flame on. (all laugh)
Orion: Rage, urine, and death.
Liam: Wow.
Laura: Don't get touched by it. Don't let it touch you.
Travis: We'll see.
Ashley: Don't let it touch you.
Liam: Work those rules.
Matt: Go for it. So go ahead and roll for attack. You have three attacks with this, at--
Marisha: Rage, urine, and death.
Matt: Are you frenzying or regular rage?
Travis: Raging, raging, rage. Just regular rage.
Matt: Okay, so you get two attacks.
Travis: Yeah. 19.
Matt: 19 hits.
Travis: And 12.
Matt: 12 also hits. (all cheer)
Travis: Awesome. And this is a 1d--
Matt: And damage, are you using it two-handed?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: 1d10 damage.
Travis: 1d10.
Matt: Plus whatever the fire damage is on the weapon.
Travis: That can't be right.
Matt: What did you roll?
Marisha: What? What the dice rolled?
Travis: 1d10? Is this the right dice?
Taliesin: If you rolled zero, you rolled a ten.
Laura: If it's a zero, it's a ten.
Marisha: Yeah.
Travis: It's a 30.
Laura: Oh, that's a three. He rolled the--
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: I was like, 30!
Matt: So, three plus your proficiency modifier, which is four.
Travis: Yeah. Seven.
Matt: No, this is for damage, so the damage would be plus your strength modifier.
Travis: Oh, four.
Matt: Yeah, so four still. So seven.
Travis: And plus seven for rage.
Matt: Plus two for rage.
Travis: Plus two for rage.
Matt: Yeah, so whatever the bonus is to your greataxe--
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: What's that?
Travis: Oh, it's-- to the greataxe is seven when I'm raging.
Matt: So then ten points of damage, then roll the fire damage as well.
Travis: Okay.
Liam: How is he keeping all of this in his mind? It's like a computer in his brain.
Laura: I know.
Travis: Is that a 1d10 also? 1d10?
Matt: It should say on the actual magical item.
Travis: Yep, yep. 1d6.
Matt: So 1d6 additional fire damage.
Travis: Five.
Matt: All right, so 15 points of damage total from the first strike. Go ahead and roll damage from the second one.
Travis: Oh, Jesus. Seven.
Matt: So 14, plus an additional 1d6.
Liam: Grog, math hard.
Travis: Three.
Matt: All right, cool. All right, so as you come running over, leaping in the air, over the ogre bodies, you then slam the hammer once in the side, the fire catching on the metal, on the black iron as it streaks through the air, lighting up the cavern around you.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: You guys see this, like, red arc, as Grog comes slamming down into the ooze.
Orion: Fire hammer!
Matt: First one, it hits, boom, smacks, the flames ignite, and the impact, you see it kind of freaks out and quivers backwards, screeching sound. As it does, there's a splash of the black ichor that hits your shoulders--
Laura: (gasps) No!
Matt: -- and you feel it burn and bite into your torso. You take ten points of acid damage.
Travis: Oh, shit.
Laura: Acid.
Ashley: Acid.
Matt: You reach back, not even thinking in the frenzy in your brain, you feel like, just seeing blood and red in your eyes, as you slam down your second strike.
Ashley: Grog is gonna start tripping.
Matt: You feel the second impact. Once again, you feel the spray of black across your body. You take an additional ten points of acid damage.
Travis: Up close sucks.
Liam: That's nothing for Grog, that's nothing.
Ashley: Nothing, nothing.
Marisha: Nothing, he likes it, feels good.
Travis: I'm pretty low.
Matt: That ends Grog's turn.
Laura: You're low? On health? Have you not healed at all?
Liam: No, we stayed up and kept watch.
Marisha: Just helped with that itch you couldn't scratch.
Laura: Jeez Louise.
Travis: No, I'm fine.
Matt: On this turn, this one pulls out of the lava--
Laura: No.
Matt: Takes an additional 2d10 from being in at the start of its turn. An additional eight damage, and moves up, both of them flank over to Grog.
Travis: Come to me, woodland creatures.
Matt: Both of them attempting to strike you from each side. As you're flanked, that is a 20 versus armor class.
Travis: That will hit.
Matt: And a 21 versus armor class.
Travis: That'll hit, too.
Marisha: You're being attacked by jello.
Matt: All right, both of the creatures, they (oozing sound) up next to you. These pseudopods kind of come billowing out, slamming into you with the force of an extremely thick, heavy battering ram. Both hit you for-- let's see, here--
Travis: You broke in their glass casket.
Matt: One hits you for 12 points of damage--
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: The other hits you for 14 points of damage.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: Remember, you're raging, so that's halved.
Travis: Oh, halved. Both of those?
Matt: Yeah.
Travis: Awesome.
Liam: Tank.
Ashley: He still has more than me.
Matt: However, both impacts slamming into your body, the leftover sludge begins to eat away and corrode the flesh upon impact. You take from both sides-- non-halved, because it is not slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing damage-- you take a total of 56 points of acid damage.
Taliesin: What?
Ashley: What?
Laura: What?
Matt: From both slams.
Travis: That's gross.
Laura: (gasps) Grog's unconscious.
Travis: No, I'm not.
Laura: You're not?
Liam: Double that? Double that, or that?
Matt: No, from both sides. 28 from each.
Ashley: How many have you got?
Travis: 14.
Laura: Oh my god.
Travis: Okay, so little piles of shit have got huevos.
Ashley: Wait, and I can't--
Matt: Clarota moves from here, up to here.
Laura: Clarota, save us!
Marisha: Really bad jello. It's, like, fridge experiment jello.
Taliesin: Coffee jello.
Marisha: Coffee jello?
Ashley: Grog!
Travis: That's me, all smart with the fire hammer.
Matt: Hey, it did damage, didn't it?
Travis: It certainly did something.
Matt: It certainly did something Clarota is going to move forward and is going to attempt a-- It's kind of close-- He is going to attempt a Lightning Bolt against this guy here.
Marisha: No.
Laura: Don't do a Lightning Bolt! What? Why would Clarota use a Lightning Bolt when he saw that the lightning did not work for me?
Matt: Clarota did not see.
Laura: Ugh.
Marisha: Clarota didn't see? Where was Clarota?
Matt: Way back here.
Liam: He has to look. He was hanging back.
Laura: Clarota is trying to screw with us.
Marisha: Why was he trailing? What the fuck?
Liam: Nah, he was hanging back.
Marisha: He's a slacker.
Liam: He's weak.
Marisha: He's a fucking slacker.
Orion: That's right, he's weak.
Liam: He's got this, but he doesn't have this. He's weak, he's hanging back.
Marisha: All right.
Liam: What is the deal with the mind flayer?
Matt: I would recommend not arguing with the DM.
Orion: Right.
Travis: Yeah, right.
Marisha: I'm not arguing with the DM, I'm calling Clarota a slacker.
Matt: Clarota, as it released the bolt of energy, it streaks past, through the air. It arcs into the side of the entity, which then absorbs it. Clarota's eyes go wide for a second. Nervous, it looks at its hands, and puts them back underneath its robe. As it does--
Laura: Fudge!
Marisha: Damn it, Clarota.
Matt: The entity divides once again.
Laura: God! Darn it.
Matt: Into two more--
Laura: What is that?
Travis: Oh, shit.
Laura: What is happening?
Travis: Balls.
Taliesin: Oh, god.
Matt: That ends its turn. At this point in time, now the loud ruckus has been glaring through this tunnel--
Liam: Shit.
Matt: You hear (clicking sound).
Liam: Shit.
Travis: Ah, not an umber hulk.
Laura: Is it another one of those--
Matt: A pair of clacking sounds. And you, as soon as you look up at the ceiling and you see two large creatures clinging to the ceiling, scurrying across with these strange hooked hands, before both immediately leap down from the ceiling.
Travis: We're in big trouble.
Taliesin: Jesus Christ.
Liam: Oh, man.
Laura: Are you freaking kidding me?
Marisha: What are those? What is that?
Laura: He's trying to kill us.
Orion: Oh.
Laura: What is this?
Matt: These two large, armored, beak-faced subterranean creatures with shells on their backs and giant hooked arms leap down from the ceiling.
Laura: We're gonna die.
Matt: One is going to attempt to strike with both of its hook attacks at Pike.
Laura: Pike isn't here!
Matt: This is one is moving over Tiberius.
Liam: Oh, Tiberius, our soft, vulnerable spot.
Orion: What are you talking about?
Matt: So, against Pike, that is 21.
Laura: Hits.
Travis: Hits.
Matt: And 13.
Travis: Misses.
Laura: Misses.
Matt: All right, you take 11 points of piercing damage.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Wherever she is. And the other one misses, clanging against the armor. The hook scrapes across metal, leaving this extremely loud sound. The other one goes twice against Tiberius. That is a 16.
Orion: A 17.
Matt: And a nine. Both miss. Barely getting out of the way. This giant, large, armored creature.
Ashley: Falling from the ceiling.
Matt: Right there, take a look-- All right, that ends that, so top of the round. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Oh, I look at him with a funky grin.
Matt: All right.
Orion: It's a funky one. How much does he weigh? 800 pounds?
Matt: Pretty heavy. Say probably close to 500-600 pounds.
Orion: Ah, beautiful. I cast Telekinesis and I hurl him over my head and chuck him at the other one. I want to get him away from Pike. I don't think I can throw him that far. How far away is he from the lava, actually?
Matt: It's about right there. It's about 35 feet.
Ashley: I'm okay. I have a lot of armor.
Laura: She's good.
Orion: Then I'll try that instead. I'll try to slam dunk.
Matt: He makes a saving throw. That fails entirely. So the creature in front of you lifts up in the air, and starts flailing about with its hooks, trying to find some purchase in the ceiling. You toss it over, and it lands squarely into the pool of lava in the center of the tunnel. You hear screeching in pain as it begins trying to find his way out. Okay.
Liam: Yes! Yes!
Marisha: I like lava pools. I like lava pools.
Matt: As it's fully submerged, all right, that is 45 points of fire damage on it immediately as it's slowly sinking into the pool of lava.
Travis: He starts sinking into the pool of lava?
Ashley: Whoa.
Matt: Tiberius just Telekinesis-ed him up in the air, and threw it into the lava pool.
Travis: Yes.
Laura: Good job.
Orion: I use two sorcerer points, and with the other one I do Glacial Blast at the other guy.
Matt: The other one there? Okay. Go ahead and roll-- Add your--
Laura: Damn, Tiberius is getting really freaking cool. Badass.
Orion: Spell attack, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Orion: 13 plus two. 15.
Matt: 15? Right now, because of the level of darkness in the room, and because of its distance from you-- You just managed to fire, just out of the range of the creature. It hits the wall behind him, leaving the slick of ice across the stone wall behind it, but unfortunately not the actual creature.
Orion: Okay. Okay. Oh! Right behind it? Do I see myself missing too? Fine. As I'm missing I'll form it into a spike at the end where the walls hit.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: Yeah!
Matt: There is now an ice spike jutting out of the wall right there. All right, that ends your turn, unless you want to move. Still got your move action.
Laura: Ooh. Nice!
Orion: I'm going to-- where's the-- that way.
Matt: This way.
Orion: Out the hell-- with the stuff-- yes.
Matt: Now it would be the ogres, but they're all dead. (all cheer)
Matt: Scanlan's up.
Travis: Yeah, come on, Scanlan!
Matt: Sees Pike in great danger. Sings a quick little ditty to go ahead and give an inspiration dice to Pike. So you get a d8.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: To help you with any sort of attack rolls, any saving throws, ability checks.
Ashley: How about for healing? Does it help with healing? Can I add it to anything?
Matt: Just attack rolls, saving throws, and checks.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Scanlan is going to attempt to dominate the monster using his Dominate Creature spell. Saving throw. It does not make it. The creature that was harrowing Pike suddenly drops its claws for a second, turns away from you, and starts looking back towards the oozes and Grog. That brings us to Vex. You're up.
Laura: Okay. Do I have line-of-sight on the other ooze that's attacking Grog? The big one?
Matt: The big one over here? You do. It's dark, and you have no light source currently, so you can try a shot, but it's going to be at disadvantage.
Laura: Okay, then I guess I should just--
Liam: Half-elves see in dim light up to 60 feet. Does that pool of lava give anything?
Matt: It gives a very dull glow to the room. It's enough where you can see there is something there. You can even take a shot as opposed to not having any chance.
Laura: What about the little ooze? One of the little oozes?
Matt: Same possibility because you're currently blocked by this creature that's currently sinking into the lava.
Laura: I guess I should attack the one that's in the lava.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Okay. Well. Oh! Can I-- Is he within ten or five feet of the other, the little ooze?
Matt: No, he's ten feet from it.
Laura: Okay, then I'll just attack him with my-- I'll just attack him.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: This is lame, that's a lame--
Travis: Do it!
Matt: So you have two attacks.
Liam: Oh.
Laura: Oh right, two attacks. 13?
Matt: 13 misses, unfortunately.
Laura: Pathetic. 20-something.
Matt: That hits. So the first one, you fire towards it, except the arrow just (whoosh) into the lava and (puff).
Laura: All right, cool.
Matt: With a slight puff of smoke.
Laura: Can I have used my flaming bowstring on the second one?
Matt: On the second one? If you'd like to.
Laura: Sweet. Oh! And I Hunter's Marked him, because I can do that.
Matt: All right, so you moved the Hunter's Mark over, he is now your quarry.
Laura: 13.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the additional fire damage and your quarry damage.
Laura: 13. 19 and 22 damage.
Matt: 22 damage, all righty. The one arrow disappears. The second one, as you release it from the bowstring, you feel the slight tingle of the arcane energy released into the arrow. The arrow bursts into flame as it releases from your bow, streaking and piercing the front of its hide as it's trying to claw its way out.
Orion: Nice!
Matt: Both of its claws are at the edges of the lava, and it's pulling itself, screeching, its mouth and eyes wild with the severe pain it's feeling as it's slowly melting him from the bottom. The arrow (impact sound) into its shoulder and burst into flame. It's now freaking out. It looks like it's having a really, really rough time making its way out.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Do you want to move, or you going to stay where you are?
Laura: I'm gonna back up and get against the wall. Oh wait, that's me!
Matt: That's you there.
Laura: Oh, I was thinking I was Keyleth, I'm gonna come up next to Keyleth.
Matt: All right, so right there?
Laura: No, against the wall.
Matt: All right, there?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. That ends your turn. Vax, you're up.
Liam: Okay, I'm gonna run over the dude in the lava, I'm gonna jump on him, probably make an acrobatics check and land right around here, between the two little slimes.
Matt: Acrobatics check.
Liam: Yeah.
Laura: Don't let the slimes hit you.
Marisha: Vault the lava.
Liam: It's acrobatics. 22.
Marisha: Vault that lava.
Matt: You jump, impact, and barely land next to them.
Laura: Oh my gosh.
Liam: Now, because they are, because Grog is--
Matt: It does get one swipe of attack of opportunity on you as you pass by.
Liam: Fine.
Matt: That is going to be a 20.
Liam: Okay. It's fine.
Matt: So, as you leap off of it, its hook swipes up towards you. You go ahead and take 14 points of piercing damage.
Laura: That's a big hit!
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Okay. Okay and since I land, since Grog is right up against those two--
Matt: I will eat this later.
Liam: I can Sneak Attack one or both of them, so I'm gonna hit the one closest to the party first.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: This is Sneak Attack.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: This is, this is-- It's an 18.
Matt: All right, that hits.
Liam: Three plus seven is-- this is my flametongue dagger, so that's-- Oh, hold on, no, I don't know what it is yet. Where's my pencil? I'm sending my dice everywhere. Nine plus six, ten, 15, 18, 40. 58 on one slime.
Matt: What is the piercing damage from the dagger?
Liam: The piercing damage?
Matt: Daggers are piercing, so yeah.
Liam: So I don't know. What is that? Is that what's besides the Sneak Attack damage?
Matt: Thank you kindly. Mysterious appearance of paper towels.
Liam: That's 18. If it's doubled for the Sneak Attack? I don't know. It's nine, without a Sneak Attack. 18 if it's Sneak Attack.
Matt: Right. Well, it's a Sneak Attack, because it is flanking.
Liam: So 18 for Sneak Attack.
Matt: Okay, got you. Cool.
Liam: That's first dagger.
Matt: All right, so second dagger. Go ahead and--
Liam: Second dagger attacks the other one. I just turn around and sink down into the other one for 16 with the keen, yeah, 16 with the keen dagger.
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: Okay, and this is probably not Sneak Attack at this point, or is it? I don't know.
Matt: No, you'll do only one Sneak Attack per round.
Liam: Okay, eight.
Matt: Eight, gotcha. So as you rush, you leap off, take the scratch in the air from the hook horror creature. You land on the ground, slash one with your dagger, slash the other. Both slashes are almost simultaneous. As you hit, you feel your blades gain purchase in both creatures, and you look down at your arms as the horrible burning sensation filters onto your hands as the splash-back. You take a total of 20 points of acid damage from the melee attacks you took against the creatures.
Liam: 20, you said?
Matt: 20 total, yes.
Laura: (whispers) Oh my god.
Liam: Okay. All right.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Percy.
Ashley: You're at 24? Fuck.
Liam: It's all right.
Taliesin: Where's the laser?
Marisha: So they're all still alive, all the oozes are still alive.
Taliesin: Laser.
Marisha: It was around here somewhere. You had it last.
Travis: What are you looking for?
Laura: What? What's happening?
Taliesin: Oh, never mind.
Marisha: Did I have it? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Taliesin: Yeah you had it, aha!
Matt: Percy, what you got?
Taliesin: I wanna move just slightly to my right. Just over there so I can get a clear shot at the oozes.
Matt: Okay, so right there?
Taliesin: Yeah, about right there, so I'm not going to hit anybody.
Matt: Okay.
Taliesin: I'm gonna take two shots at the little oozes. At the--
Matt: This one here?
Taliesin: Yeah, that right little ooze.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Little ooze.
Taliesin: First shot. 27 to hit. And that does ten points of damage. And then I'm gonna take another shot at him, I'm going to take a fire shot. And I'm gonna take a negative five to hit. And that's 14.
Matt: Hits.
Taliesin: So that's 15 plus-- that's 23 points of damage plus three points of fire damage.
Matt: 26, nice.
Travis: Yeah, boy. Perce!
Marisha: On the little ooze?
Ashley: 26 points of damage?
Laura: Woot woot!
Travis: Wow!
Taliesin: Plus fire.
Laura: Plus fire.
Travis: Get on it, nasty.
Liam: Pow, pow, pow, pow.
Matt: All right, that brings us to Keyleth.
Marisha: All the oozes are still alive?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Damn oozes. All right. I'm gonna do something crafty.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Get it!
Matt: Gotta eat sometime, guys.
Marisha: I'm gonna bamf into an eagle.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: I'm gonna fly over-- I think I'm going to land right by here.
Matt: There?
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Matt: All right.
Marisha: And I'm gonna do Thunder Wave. Which is--
Matt: So you're coming out of eagle form?
Marisha: So I'm coming out of eagle form. I was just using the eagle to fly.
Matt: Okay, okay.
Marisha: Coming out of eagle form, and I'm gonna do my thunderpush. So I take my staff and I throw it down. Kerplash.
Travis: Yeah.
Marisha: Today it's kerplash.
Travis: I buy kerplash.
Marisha: Kerplash!
Taliesin: Okay.
Matt: All right! So what is the radius effect on that?
Marisha: It's a 15-foot cube and it pushes everything ten feet away from me. Directly away.
Matt: 15-foot cube, okay. So like this cube here?
Marisha: Sure. Yeah, a cube in front of me.
Matt: All right, cool. So, they both get saving throws.
Marisha: Not Grog, though. I'm gonna just--
Matt: You can do that. Okay, neither makes their saving throw. So go ahead and roll damage, or whatever it does.
Marisha: 2d8.
Matt: 2d8 to each. What is the damage type on that?
Marisha: Six. It just says damage and then they're pushed. I was--
Matt: Okay. So I'll go ahead and say it's thunder damage. All right, so they're pushed how long? Ten feet?
Marisha: Ten feet. Directly away from me.
Matt: Yeah. So they're pushed right there. Got it.
Marisha: I was hoping they would go into the lava.
Matt: Unfortunately, it's not far enough. Is that your turn?
Marisha: Yep!
Matt: All right. Pike!
Ashley: Okay, can I sprinter's boot over to Grog? Sorry, no glasses, guys. So I don't see where I am.
Travis: A boot?
Matt: You can, yes.
Ashley: Okay, so I'm going to Cure Wounds.
Matt: All right.
Ashley: 'Cause that's what I do.
Matt: It's what you do as a healer, yo.
Ashley: So let's see, 1d8 plus spell damage. Wait, so I'm gonna do it at fourth level, so that means I can roll how many times?
Matt: 4d8.
Ashley: Okay, so--
Matt: Plus five.
Ashley: Five, eight, 16.
Laura: Ooh! That's good! 24?
Ashley: 24. So you heal 24.
Travis: Thank you!
Matt: Nice.
Ashley: And then--
Laura: Plus, do you add that to anything?
Ashley: Well, he adds it to his 14 that he already has.
Matt: Sorry.
Ashley: And then, can I do anything else while I'm there?
Matt: No, bonus action to do the item, move, action to cast the spell.
Orion: No.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: So that's your turn.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: Well done. All right, that brings us to Grog.
Travis: Right, yeah. I would like to come out of my rage.
Matt: All right. So it's level two exhaustion.
Travis: For the first time ever.
Laura: Ever.
Liam: Wow. Not sure how I feel about that.
Travis: What do you-- where do you wanna go? Towards Keyleth or toward the-- Okay. I'd like to pick up Pike and run balls over this way.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: Right towards this area.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: I'm all on my own.
Travis: Well, yeah, look. It nearly killed me the one time I hit it.
Orion: You shouldn't be doing melee on things that can split in half to begin with.
Laura: We're gonna die.
Matt: All right, so you pick up Pike. Level two exhaustion, your speed is halved.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Okay.
Matt: So you can only move 20 feet.
Travis: Right.
Orion: You messed everything up.
Liam: Hey man, if I can't be a hero here, where am I gonna do it?
Orion: Oh, every other time is fine.
Travis: Do you want to stay? It doesn't really matter.
Matt: You grab her, you turn--
Travis: You want to stay over there?
Matt: -- run that way?
Travis: You know what? I'll--
Marisha: Aim for in front of the Scientology Center. It always goes over really well.
Travis: Do you just wanna stay?
Ashley: I'm gonna-- I'll stay, I'll stay.
Travis: I'll leave Pike where she is and I'll run up and flank Iceberg Lobsterface.
Matt: Right there?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: Okay, so, that's as far as you can get, unfortunately--
Travis: Okay.
Matt: -- 'cause you're double-fatigued.
Taliesin: My name in high school.
Matt: As you run past, both of those slimes--
Ashley: Double?
Marisha: Double-fatigue?
Taliesin: Iceberg Lobsterface.
Matt: -- flash out with pseudopods, as reactions.
Liam: I'm surrounded by shit.
Taliesin: It's what all the kids called me.
Matt: So, two attacks against you.
Taliesin: Long story.
Matt: That's a 22.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Fuck!
Matt: And a 19.
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: All right, so both slam you for 24 points of bludgeoning damage. You're not raged, so it's not halved.
Travis: Okay.
Laura: Ugh.
Matt: So 24 against you, with an additional 56 points of acid damage.
Ashley: Wait! What?
Travis: Unconscious!
Taliesin: Damn it.
Laura: Why didn't you get acid damage?
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Matt: They haven't hit him yet. That was just Grog running away.
Laura: Oh.
Matt: Both of them getting attacks of opportunity on him, and both hitting.
Liam: I am surrounded by shit.
Ashley: Guys, guys, guys.
Matt: Grog falls face-first, right next-- right, like, literally cradling-- His unconscious body is cradling the two dead ogres right now.
Laura: No!
Matt: This slight sound of 'sss' as the acid is, like, sizzling and scarring his flesh.
Laura: Nobody attack the things up close!
Matt: That brings us to their turn.
Laura: Oh, no!
Liam: I'm going unconscious here, kids.
Laura: All of our heavy hitters are dead.
Matt: These three oozes turn. Actually, this one's going to move here--
Ashley: Oh, hello!
Matt: -- towards Pike.
Liam: (Tommy Wiseau voice) Oh, hi, Pike. (all laugh)
Matt: You get an attack of opportunity on it, if you like--
Laura: Oh, hit it!
Liam: Hit it? Yeah.
Matt: -- as it slips away.
Laura: Get it!
Taliesin: Get it!
Liam: Do I have to roll to do that? Right?
Matt: Yeah, you still have roll to hit it.
Liam: 26.
Matt: Hits.
Laura: Why is it going up there?
Ashley: You're gonna kill this thing!
Liam: 11.
Matt: 11?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Points of damage?
Liam: That's the damage. 11.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
Matt: All right, cool.
Ashley: What did you guys vote on?
Marisha: No shit.
Laura: Did they vote on this?
Ashley: Probably.
Matt: So, the one that's attacking you, Pike, that is a--
Laura: You guys suck.
Matt: -- 23, versus armor class.
Ashley: Yes, that hits. (all laugh)
Matt: All right. You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact of the pseudopod, with an additional 28 points of acid damage.
Liam: Son of a gun.
Marisha: Pseudopod?
Ashley: Okay, so an additional 28 on top of that.
Travis: You guys are dicks.
Matt: Yeah, so a total of 40 points of damage from the strike.
Ashley: I understand.
Marisha: Did he just call it a 'pseudopod'?
Liam: Masochists.
Matt: The other two are going to attack you.
Liam: Sure they are.
Matt: That's going to be a 19 versus armor class.
Liam: Yeah, that hits 'cause I'm at 19. Right? So that hits if I'm at 19?
Matt: It hits. Yeah. Okay. The other one is a 14, so that misses.
Liam: Okay, so I use Uncanny Dodge on the one that hit.
Marisha: Oh!
Matt: All right. So.
Taliesin: Nice!
Liam: Whoa!
Marisha: Yeah you do.
Matt: As you pull that away, you-- You take half-damage from the strike?
Liam: Half-damage. That's right.
Matt: All right, so that's-- this was a 40. Take 20 points of damage, total, from the bludgeoning and the acid.
Liam: Oh, I am rough, kids. I am rough.
Laura: Plus acid?
Matt: All right. That ends their turn.
Laura: Oh my god.
Matt: Clarota--
Laura: Clarota, save us!
Matt: -- is going to step forward to there.
Liam: Use your magic, you strange flayer, you.
Laura: Do not use Lightning Bolt.
Marisha: Yeah. No Lightning Bolt, Clarota.
Matt: Clarota reaches forward, uses his own-- Taking a note from Tiberius, uses his Telekinesis spell. The arcanist marks on its body flare up, and as it does you can see this large creature--
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: -- gets lifted up, and slams on top of this hook horror--
Orion: Yes!
Liam: That's awesome.
Matt: -- pushing it further into the lava and doing additional acid damage to the hook horror, which--
Laura: Yeah! And it dies?
Orion: Damn hook whores!
Liam: (Cosby voice) You see--
Matt: -- which completely dissolves and melts the hook horror. (all cheer)
Travis: All right, Clarence!
Matt: As it pushes down, the ooze just touches the edge of the lava, not taking full damage from the impact, but just enough from the portion of it. LIAM (Jimmy Stewart voice) Clarence! Clarence!
Matt: Taking an additional five points of fire damage. All right, it's that one there. Great. All right, that brings us to the hook horror's turn, who is currently dominated by Scanlan. Is going to rush forward to the edge here, and strike twice at the--
Laura: Yeah, Scanlan!
Matt: -- creature in the lava. Both hit.
Travis: Yes!
Laura: I'm full.
Matt: It's prone. That deals six plus 14. Eight. All right. The hook horror that Scanlan's controlling slams its hooks down into the ooze, causing the ooze to get pushed further into the lava. As you see its form begin to dissipate and slowly disintegrate into the pool of lava.
Laura: Yeah!
Matt: Leaving this dark, cooled kind of surface element to it. Slowly breaking apart, dissipating over the magma.
Ashley: Bye, bitch.
Matt: End of its turn, it's going to try and make a saving throw against the domination effect. Rolls a natural 20. Breaks the effect, however I feel like it did its good for the turn.
Laura: Damn it. Did he take acid damage? Is he hurt?
Matt: Yeah, he did. He took 20 points of acid damage from each strike.
Laura: Nice. Good, good, good.
Ashley: So there is only one left?
Laura: No, there is two little oozes and a big one.
Liam: Two oozes and a monster man.
Matt: All right, that brings us to the top of the turn. Tiberius, you're up.
Orion: Ah very well. I scooch myself a little bit over behind him.
Marisha: (sings) One little two little three little oozes.
Matt: Over here?
Orion: Yeah, that's good, I can see his fanny from here. I'm going to cast Glacial Blast again, but I'm going to form a giant spike once more and jam it right in his asshole.
Liam: Oh, he's pulling a Vax.
Orion: And I'm going to try and catapult it right where it's over. Because it's still at the edge of the lava pool, right?
Matt: Mm-hm. So you're going to glacial spike in the-- Kancho him. Magically kancho.
Orion: Magic ice kancho blast.
Matt: Arcane cheat code. All right. So go ahead and roll to attack.
Liam: Up up down down left right left right.
Travis: A B A B N.
Orion: 24.
Matt: That definitely hits. Go ahead and roll damage.
Orion: Yeah. One, two, three, four, six. That is eight. What is that, a 12? 15, 16, 18, 19. 20. 20 damage.
Matt: 20 damage? All right, and he's grappled, correct?
Orion: I'm not trying to grapple him, I'm trying to just push him.
Matt: Push him? Shove?
Orion: Yeah.
Laura: Into the lava.
Orion: Because he's like swinging at that dude so I'm like up his keister.
Matt: All right. All right. So he does make his saving throw.
Orion: Okay.
Matt: Unfortunately, so it doesn't push him into the lava, but it does slam him and does a shit-ton of damage to him, so.
Orion: Nice.
Marisha: In his pooper.
Matt: Looking rough. Just a little bit.
Orion: Yeah. I'll spend another two points.
Matt: How many points do you have now?
Orion: After this, I'll have five.
Matt: Okay.
Orion: Because we had the rest, I regenerated all my stuff.
Matt: Right. Right.
Orion: So I spent two already.
Travis: He's making trouble.
Orion: I spent another two on the fight. And I'm going to do another one. Up his ass again.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for that.
Orion: Yeah. 20.
Matt: Uh-huh.
Marisha: Uh-huh.
Orion: Yeah and that is 15. 15 points of damage.
Matt: Makes his saving throw again, unfortunately. It does not push him. Does additional points of damage. He's looking really rough. You can see now, this ice has encrusted around the outside of its armor.
Orion: And his butt.
Matt: And where the wounds from the impact are, there's cracking shards of ice crystal jutting outward.
Orion: From his arsehole.
Matt: From his asshole. Scanlan's turn. Should have had your sheet, Scanlan. Scanlan's going to go ahead and, for the hell of it, run up and make an attack. (all laugh)
Travis: Eff him up, Scanlan.
Ashley: Let's go, Scanlan.
Matt: Why not? Pulling out, his singing sword arches in the air, and begins humming to it as he walks upon-- The humming kind of adds this vibration element, like a tuning fork blade, as he arcs the sword down.
Matt: A natural 18. I'm going to assume that hits. That's going to be a 1d8 longsword damage. That's an 8 plus-- 12 points of damage.
Laura: Woo, Scanlan.
Travis: Yeah, Scanlan.
Marisha: Yeah, Scanlan.
Ashley: Go Scanlan.
Matt: The blade swings down to where the ice has encrusted the back of its armored shell. Scanlan takes the blade, swings it down, and pierces it directly into where that ice has gathered. As it does, it cracks open the back of its armored shell. Almost peeling it open like a shrimp. You can now see all its fleshy innards are exposed to the outside. It's looking extremely, extremely close to death. It's screaming in pain, kind of thrashing about now.
Liam: Shrimping, cool.
Matt: Vex, you're up.
Laura: Okay. I'm gonna Lightning Bolt the bad guy.
Matt: This guy?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right.
Laura: Oh wait, no, I should save my brother.
Liam: Maybe.
Laura: Okay, I'm going to attack one of the oozies instead.
Liam: The one right behind me.
Laura: The one right behind him.
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack.
Laura: Yeah. Yeah, 23.
Matt: Very nice, very nice, that hits
Laura: Oh I Hunter's Mark him first. Bonus.
Orion: Bonus.
Liam: Excellent.
Laura: 14 for the first attack.
Ashley: Wait, do we still have Scanlan's inspiration song?
Matt: You do, yeah.
Liam: You do. You have the die.
Ashley: I have the die. Is what I'm talking about, sorry.
Laura: Do I get six on both attacks? I do, don't I?
Matt: Mm-hm.
Laura: Yeah. 17 on the second attack.
Matt: All right.
Liam: Kill it. Kill it.
Matt: With a sickening (splat) sound, the ooze splatters across the floor.
Laura: Yeah.
Liam: Thank you.
Matt: Leaving a small, sizzling pool that's scarring the rock below it. You can see it slowly depressing into the ground. You gonna stay where you are?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: All right. That brings us to Vax.
Liam: All right. I walk back about 15 feet, and I go (shnk-shnk). Throw daggers at it.
Matt: Both daggers?
Liam: First one's a 15.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: Okay and that is-- this is my keen dagger. That is nine.
Matt: Nine hits.
Liam: Second dagger. Definitely hits, that's a 26.
Matt: Hits. None of them are Sneak Attack, unfortunately.
Liam: That's fine. This is flametongue. I don't know if fire helps, but that is an eight. So nine and an eight.
Matt: Nine and an eight, gotcha. Both daggers splash into it. You can see where they would slowly be scarred and damaged.
Liam: Except that they teleport back to my blink belt.
Laura: Yay, blink belt.
Matt: As they return to your belt, you can feel there a slight bit of liquid left, and you shake it off quickly.
Liam: Shite.
Laura: (sings) Shake it off.
Matt: But no other effect that that. It looks like it's having a hard time keeping its form together. It's kind of shaking and (oozing sound) as it moves. Still running towards Pike.
Liam: Finish that shit, Pike.
Matt: That brings us to Percy.
Liam: Hit it.
Taliesin: All right. I'm just taking the shot. Taking a shot with the bonus. So that's 14 to hit.
Matt: Mm-hm.
Taliesin: That hits. So that's 18 points of damage.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: And I'm gonna take the other shot.
Matt: Is this against the ooze?
Taliesin: Yeah, yeah. Sorry, the ooze.
Matt: All right. Yep.
Taliesin: And that's 13 to hit.
Ashley: Grog's unconscious?
Liam: He'll be fine in ten minutes, Pike.
Ashley: What?
Liam: He's out of the fight, but he'll be fine.
Ashley: Oh, okay.
Taliesin: And that's 11 points of damage.
Matt: The first shot hits, and the ooze kind of quivers. It leaves this kind of gaping hole, and it begins to slowly reform itself. Before it can, you see the other weak spot where the top of its physical form is barely wavering, and it's able to keep corporeal. You aim the second shot, and as you fire, it detonates and that portion of its upper torso-- whatever it would be-- gets flung off and splats against the wall, the rest of it slowly liquefying as the rest of the slime is destroyed.
Ashley: Nice.
Travis: Yeah, buddy.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: So I'm going to back up against the wall. I'm going to back to the wall of the-- Yeah.
Matt: Okay. Keyleth.
Marisha: Do I have enough speed to get next to Vex there? 30 feet?
Matt: Vax, you mean? Yeah, you do.
Marisha: Is that Vax? All right, once again, I'm going to Thorn Whip this bitch.
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for attack.
Liam: (sings) Thorn Whip.
Marisha: 26.
Matt: That hits, definitely, go ahead and roll damage.
Liam: (sings) Thorn Whip, the bitch is dead.
Marisha: Eight points of damage.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I pull him--
Matt: How do you want to do this? (all cheer)
Matt: The creature is slashing about with its claws.
Marisha: So I take my Thorn Whip, and I go (whip sound). And I grab him. And I see he's still struggling. So I take another one and I go (whip sound) on the other one. And I just go Spiderman-style.
Matt: And (dragging sound). As you do it, it plummets face-first into the--
Laura: Woo!
Matt: -- both into the magma and the slightly still-sizzling form left over from the ooze that had melted there.
Orion: Magma and acid.
Marisha: And just for flavor, I take a big gust of air, a big Wind Burst and I go (whoosh) down into the lava pool. Encrusting it all.
Matt: As you do, it slams down. You hear it scream underneath as its body begins to quiver. The Wind Burst hits, and the cool air rushes through the tunnel. All of your guys' hair and everything gets blown back for a second. You have to cover your eyes, and as you look back-- (all laugh)
Matt: The magma has cooled to a solid rock-covering surface. As darkness falls back into the tunnel--
Orion: Oh, Light!
Matt: As Tiberius hits Light, in the tunnel you can see the--
Laura: Grog!
Matt: -- hook horror, which, a portion of its upper torso is now encrusted into the actual cavern floor.
Laura: Awesome.
Travis: Amazing.
Laura: Save Grog!
Ashley: I'm going to go over to Grog and Cure Wounds at fourth level.
Matt: All right.
Liam: You tried to kill us, but you failed.
Laura: Don't challenge them.
Ashley: Don't.
Taliesin: Nice try.
Ashley: Nice job, guys.
Travis: I did a pretty decent job, actually.
Matt: I ate pizza in front of you guys. I don't care. It was tasty. Thank you.
Orion: Yeah.
Marisha: I don't care. No shame.
Matt: Delicious pizza.
Laura: No. We're not gonna have Trinket this whole thing. We better get back to Trinket soon. I'm freaking out, you guys.
Marisha: That's true, if we keep going.
Ashley: 25 points of heal!
Liam: Just in seven more weeks.
Travis: Thank you!
Ashley: You're welcome!
Marisha: I might be able to guide him--
Liam: Trinket's on the sidelines, man.
Laura: That makes me so sad!
Liam: We're not going back.
Laura: And it's all you guys' fault!
Liam: But it was like three years, Trinket was by your side. This is the first time ever.
Matt: As Grog, you come to consciousness again--
Travis: Ah! Did I kill it?
Laura: You did, Grog! Good job!
Taliesin: Yes, Grog, you killed it good.
Laura: Also, handful of pizza.
Travis: I put my hand in my pizza! (all laugh)
Liam: You killed them all, Grog! You were magnificent!
Marisha: Yay, Grog!
Travis: Aha! Tell me more! (snores) (all laugh)
Ashley: Wait--
Marisha: Now we pass out.
Ashley: -- so can I also do a Mass Cure Wounds? Since I just did a--
Matt: Yeah, if you'd like!
Ashley: Okay. So I'll also do a Mass Cure Wounds.
Laura: Yay!
Liam: Yes, 'cause I'm at four hit points.
Ashley: Yeah, you're pretty bad.
Marisha: Oof.
Laura: Brother.
Taliesin: I'm fine.
Liam: Oh, brother, where art thou?
Orion: I feel fine!
Laura: I feel fine.
Marisha: Ah, me too.
Taliesin: I feel fine.
Liam: Oh! Oh! Oh! Fancy you! Blah-blah-blah-blah! (all laugh)
Taliesin: Seems that there's one table where everyone is perfectly reasonable!
Orion: All the time, yes, Vax!
Liam: I'm at four hit points! You go fuck yourself.
Marisha: Yes, everyone on this side of the table's good.
Orion: There's an acid guy! Stab. (all laugh)
Liam: I was trying to save his ass! I was hurting myself on purpose.
Matt: All right. So, as you guys steel yourselves for a moment, kind of recovering from that fateful encounter, you--
Ashley: 22 points of healing--
Laura: To everyone.
Matt: To everyone.
Liam: That's pretty good.
Matt: Everyone heals 22 points of damage.
Liam: That's half-ish.
Taliesin: I reload.
Laura: Well done, well done.
Liam: Half-ish.
Ashley: Something additional.
Travis: Thank you, Pike.
Ashley: Oh, you're welcome, Grog! My best pal.
Travis: Hell yeah. (growling noises)
Ashley: (growling noises)
Matt: All right. (all laugh)
Travis: It's a language we speak.
Ashley: Yeah, man, it's like our own thing. (all laugh)
Matt: You guys push forward down the tunnel--
Laura: Oh!
Liam: Yes.
Laura: Limping.
Matt: For another 20 or so minutes, bringing yourself along, sore from the impact of the battle.
Liam: I'm burnt.
Matt: Bits of your armor scarred. By the way, your armor--
Liam: Yes.
Matt: -- what type of armor was it?
Liam: It was-- it's magical. I found it in the goblin city. Studded leather armor, plus two.
Matt: All right. For the acidic nature of this--
Liam: Wait. Do you know what's funny? What's funny is, the armor I had before this, that I wasn't paying attention to, was acid resistant! Isn't that funny?
Marisha: And now you don't have it no more?
Liam: That's so funny!
Laura: That's great!
Matt: Look at that!
Travis: That's really funny. Keep going.
Marisha: That is funny.
Liam: It's in my bag!
Matt: You wipe it off. Thankfully, the magic enchantment protects the armor entirely.
Laura: Ah! See! That was acid-resistant, too!
Matt: Grog, what armor do you have?
Liam: Even better!
Travis: Oh, it's like hides and leathers and--
Matt: Just regular hide.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: Currently, as you're walking, you look down and notice that the armor on your torso has near-completely dissolved.
Laura: (gasps)
Travis: Son of a-- Well, you're welcome, ladies!
Laura: My, my, Grog!
Travis: (sings) It's time for a show!
Orion: Grog! Will you put those away!
Matt: As it stands, you have no additional armor class bonus for any armor.
Laura: Oh no!
Matt: Your hide armor is gone. It is completely dissolved.
Laura: What about the black armor? Put on the dwarven black plate armor!
Travis: They're dwarves.
Ashley: What if we melt it and then make it a big one?
Laura: If it's magical, it might fit you if you just try it on!
Ashley: I don't know, would that work?
Orion: It's true!
Liam: Hold on, hold on. DM! DM. I take off my magical armor, which was dwarven in shape before--
Laura: (gasps) Oh, good!
Liam: -- but I take it off, it shrinks down to like a little toddler--
Laura: Oh! Ew. Cover yourself, Vax!
Liam: I'm wearing, like, a Scientology unibody underwear underneath-- (all laugh)
Laura: Oh, okay.
Ashley: Wouldn't that be-- that's mormons!
Liam: The armor shrinks down to like toddler-size--
Orion: I don't know what that means!
Liam: -- and I hand it to Grog.
Taliesin: It's probably for the best.
Liam: And I go to my pack and I take out my old armor, which is acid resistant. Not quite as cool as what I was wearing, but I don't want him--
Travis: You had two pairs of gloves?
Liam: I can't-- huh?
Travis: Kidding. It's Dumb & Dumber.
Liam: I can't stare at his pecs for the next three days, so I'll give him my armor.
Laura: I can.
Liam: Ooh! And put on what I had on before.
Matt: All right. So you take a moment, and hand him new armor, and Grog, this scarred, nearly naked goliath form, has been lumbering through this hallway--
Travis: Ooh!
Matt: Hoo! Modesty, Grog! (all laugh)
Matt: You place the studded leather on--
Liam: Studded leather armor plus two, okay?
Matt: So mark that for your AC.
Travis: Studded armor leather plus two.
Ashley: Wait, but then what are--
Laura: He's got his own armor.
Liam: I've got my old armor. I found that armor down here.
Taliesin: I'm gonna be the person who actually examines the cart, at this point.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Oh! That's a good idea.
Laura: Plus we have other plate armor!
Liam: That's a loaner.
Taliesin: You know, I just figured someone ought to.
Marisha: What the fuck did we open?
Travis: Plus two to AC?
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: And it should be me.
Marisha: Yeah.
Liam: No, it's more complicated than that.
Matt: Okay, here's the circumstance for you, real fast, before we get to that. So, Grog.
Travis: Yep.
Matt: The armor you had on was hide, which was a dex bonus of 12 plus your dex. Studded leather is also the same, so your AC actually goes up.
Travis: Oh! Ho! Something that you'd think!
Matt: So, what was your AC previously?
Travis: 18?
Matt: 18?
Travis: Yeah.
Matt: It should now be 20.
Travis: Yay! Yes!
Laura: Yay, Grog!
Travis: Grog takes the top off and does a--
Liam: Loaner! Loaner.
Taliesin: Put it back on.
Liam: Loaner.
Laura: It's his, he's keeping it. It's going to stink like Grog, you won't want that back.
Travis: The things I'm gonna do in this armor, you're not going to want it back. Just give me and Scanlan one night to break it in, and I promise you, it will be mine.
Matt: Just the two of you?
Travis: Well, uh, you know what I mean. Who am I talking to?
Matt: All right, well, go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Taliesin: An investigation check, what is that? Eight.
Matt: Okay. Looking at the cart, the cart is a rickety wooden thing, but what was in the cart was a large glass unit, a containment unit that was sealed off. You can see the inside of it has slight scarring to the glass, but it seems to be resistant to whatever the loose creature was contained in it. Along the inside of the cart, you notice there are a couple of just left over chunks of flesh of different colors, patches or pieces you see, like part of a hand that's just in there.
Laura: Ew.
Matt: Partially decomposed, to a certain extent. It looks like these were either used to feed whatever the creature was in there or remnants of some other strange collection. Based on the best you guys can ascertain, this creature was part of the experimentation-type process that the weird naga creature you fought earlier came from.
Laura: Oh, great, so there could be more.
Travis: Did we search the ogres?
Laura: Yeah! Loot the ogres!
Matt: Ogres are wearing nasty, nasty, tattered at this point, hide armor
Liam: Grog could do it.
Matt: They both carry total, amongst the two of them, about 24 pieces of gold.
Laura: Sweet.
Travis: I wanna take it.
Laura: I add it to party funds.
Travis: I am searching the ogres, and I keep the 24 gold, but I give two to Vax.
Liam: Thank you.
Travis: You're welcome.
Marisha: Can I go and grab shards of the broken glass of the case?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah. So mark that in your inventory, you have some hand-sized shards of broken glass.
Travis: And two to Pike for healing me.
Ashley: Oh, thanks.
Matt: Anything else you guys wish to do in this section?
Liam: So we searched the ogres, that's it. I guess we should just start walking further down.
Travis: You take a poo on the black puddle of acid?
Taliesin: I think-- Well, no. That's the only heat source, that's the only lava there was, and now it's cool.
Matt: And now it has cooled, yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, never mind, then.
Marisha: Sorry.
Taliesin: It's all right, I think it's worth it.
Travis: I'd like to take a hit dice.
Matt: Okay. Go ahead and do that. As many as you'd like.
Liam: Let's rest for a half-hour or so.
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: Take a moment, you can spend any hit dice now that you need to to heal yourself. Just make sure to mark how many you've used.
Taliesin: I just hear the sounds of ones.
Matt: All right. As you guys take a moment to heal yourselves, you pull yourselves back up to your feet, and you tread further down this tunnel. Another 25-30 minutes of the slight curvature, and it gets steeper and steeper, until eventually it opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you. You see a large waterfall pouring down from above--
Ashley: (gasps)
Laura: Mother bitches.
Marisha: It looped around?
Matt: You are on the outskirts of where the next tunnel opens up, where there are a few small streams of lava pouring from the ceiling. You look above, and you can see the top of the downward cavern. There's the giant lake beneath. And across the way, you can see the waterfall where Clarota was originally discovered.
Marisha: Well, we should go pick up Trinket.
Taliesin: At least you get your bear.
Laura: (gasps) Trinket!
Marisha: Let's go pick up Trinket.
Laura: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Travis: You're going to get your bear killed.
Liam: Can you explain? I don't think I understand.
Marisha: We left Trinket over there.
Liam: Can you explain with your map, Matt?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: We're at the bottom of the cave.
Orion: We went down and just--
Liam: I get we doubled back, but it would help the visual, I think.
Matt: Yeah so-- and I'll have more of this for you guys next week.
Travis: It was a warp tube.
Matt: The path you guys took was essentially-- lead to this back area, which I'll draw for next week, and a tunnel that curved all the way around and exited right there.
Laura: So we're--
Liam: All right, we'll go get your bear.
Laura: We'll go get Trinket, and then we'll go down the path we should have gone down in the first place next week.
Marisha: Son of a bitch.
Taliesin: Except we get Trinket.
Laura: But Trinket!
Marisha: So it's not useless.
Laura: It was absolutely useless.
Liam: That's fate, that's kismet.
Marisha: Is there, like, any other way down here?
Matt: Other than the fact you've completely destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well as the one helming the war camp above. You've acquired new magical items and defeated one of the abominations that was created for the siege war. I think you accomplished quite a few things, though maybe not as directly as you were hoping.
Taliesin: And we acquired our bear.
Laura: We got our bear back.
Matt: All right, so you, taking the flying carpet, it's a very precarious journey as the weight limit for the carpet--
Liam: You go on it, right?
Laura: He's with me, and he cast Featherfall.
Matt: You can go ahead and cast Fly on your bear. Trinket awkwardly (bear noises) manages to swim her way down to the bottom floor.
Laura: Come, Trinket, come.
Matt: As you make your way to the base of the watery lake, at the bottom, you can see a swish to the water, and a very familiar sight briefly shows itself in the distance. As you see a slick domed fish-like head protrude with a few tentacles in the distance, you all instinctively step quite a distance away, and it seems to withdraw back into the water.
Marisha: Can I-- While I see it real quick, I'm going to go ahead and channel and cast Beast Sense through it.
Matt: Nothing bestial of it. This is not a natural creature.
Marisha: Good to know.
Matt: Clarota once again whispers to the rest of you, "Stay at bay. The Aboleth is dangerous."
Laura: Aboleth?
Marisha: Aboleth.
Matt: You all step back and turn now into the the tunnel that extends further into the heart of this mountain. You see streams of lava pouring from the top occasionally, and one central flow of molten rock tends to fill half of the cavern, like a small river heading down into the base of the mountain. This is very familiar to you, as it's the path that your dream took you.
Ashley: Guys, this is really familiar to me. (all laugh)
Laura: We spent a whole game doing--
Marisha: Well, we took a wrong turn, I guess.
Liam: I don't know. We were flexing our muscles a little bit.
Laura: Flexing our muscles.
Marisha: Yeah, I like it.
Laura: Plus you got us new armor out of it.
Travis: And I got naked, too.
Matt: As you guys begin to step into the next lengths of your subterranean journey, we'll pick that up next week. Thank you all so much for tuning into Critical Role.
Laura: Man, oh man, oh man.
Matt: Some tense battles. An intense encounter choice on you guys' part. Well done on that.
Ashley: I want to keep going.
Liam: Who's this guy?
Matt: What is this?
Zac: All right, so. Amy was the winner of our first giveaway.
Matt: Congrats, Amy. (all cheer)
Marisha: Huzzah.
Zac: I ask whoever hasn't signed this, we're going to pass it around to all sign it for Amy.
Matt: Awesome, we'll all do that.
Zac: As a thank-you for Amy, she's an avid fan.
Laura: Yay!
Matt: Thank you, Amy, that's awesome.
Marisha: Thanks for being a fan.
Ashley: Thanks, Amy.
Zac: As a personal challenge, guys, from me to you, I think we are, what are we, 18 away, Lucas?
Lucas: 19.
Laura: 19?
Matt: 19 away from our next package?
Zac: From the next one.
Lucas: Is it at 1,550?
Zac: Yeah.
Lucas: Oh, we're 29 away.
Laura: Oh, okay.
Matt: Aw.
Zac: Are you sure?
Lucas: Yeah, we're at 1,521.
Zac: Okay, so we've got a little bit of a ways to go, but I'm going to go ahead and have these guys sign this one as well, and I'm going to push you guys that by the end of tonight, if we reach 1,550, I'll go ahead and throw this in with the next promo kit, as well. And if not I'll hang onto it for myself, and I won.
Matt: Boom.
Zac: Thank you guys so much. That was fun. It gets more intense like every week.
Matt: That's apparently the path this is taking, so--
Marisha: We keep getting knocked unconscious.
Travis: We make amazing decisions. (all laugh)
Zac: And just so you guys know, that was the chat room that decided on your fate.
Laura: You?
Travis: Sons of bitches.
Matt: Yeah, second week in a row.
Travis: (sings) Why can't we be friends?
All: (sing) Why can't we be friends?
Matt: So the chat room creature choice, those will be an occasional thing, not a weekly thing, 'cause it's too difficult to keep up with that and a little too random. Plus that's just too many creatures to be prepared for. But every few weeks or so, I'm gonna throw one out there for you guys. So come and watch. Hopefully you'll be there for one of those episodes. Put your friends together, vote for the creature you want to see them fight, and if a TPK happens, not my fault, it's totally on you guys.
Laura: Is that a total party kill?
Matt: Total party kill.
Zac: That's intense. So, guys, we're not going to go offline just now. We're going to stick around for a little while. We're going to throw it up while we move some cameras, so I'm going to leave it up to the chat room. It's up to you guys, we can either come back and play some Bloodborne on the PS4 that you guys bought us, or we can come back and play some Just Dance 2014 that you guys also bought us. So there's dancing or Bloodborne. It's up to you guys.
Matt: Dancing is fun to watch, Bloodborne just to watch him get really, really angry.
Zac: I don't get angry. Lucas gets angry, though.
Matt: This game, the beginning of this game will make you angry. All right, all right.
Marisha: You don't get angry? Have you played Dark Souls or Demon Souls? Because--
Zac: I think actually--
Matt: Demon Souls mimics, man, I know the pain you're in for.
Zac: What was it like, Bachee or something like that? Man, that game pissed me off.
Orion: Bocce ball?
Zac: Wings of-- ire, ear, something like that.
Matt: Oh yeah, I know what you're talking about.
Zac: Man, that was heavy. Would any of you guys be interested in sticking around to dance a round or two if we were to go to Just Dance? It's a nightly staple here. We end the nights with dancing. I don't know if you guys have seen that ridiculousness, but--
Matt: Who would want to stick around for that?
Zac: They're all shivering in fear, you guys
Liam: How soon will that start? I'll stay for 20.
Matt: We can stay for a little bit.
Zac: I bet they're are all going to ask for dancing now.
Lucas: See a lot of Bloodborne, actually.
Zac: Oh, really?
Matt: Oh, I live for Bloodborne, man.
Zac: Well, the second--

[END OF EPISODE]

[START OF EPISODE]
Matt: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play Dungeons and Dragons, or are a little late on the draw when shouting the phrase out, Travis Willingham. (laughs) Anyway, before we get into tonight's episode, let's go ahead and jump into our announcements. Let's see here, we've got a new game called Injustice 2 that just came out.
Travis: Yeah!
Ashley: Yeah!
Laura: Wait a minute. What is this Injustice 2 you speak of?
Travis: Is that the shapes and pie-making game that you play in the kitchen bakery?
Marisha: It's like Cooking Mama.
Laura: I watched a video today of you and you fighting, which was pretty exciting.
Matt: Yeah, we have all the Flashes covered, I think.
Taliesin: All of the Flashes are on this show.
Laura: That's crazy.
Matt: So who do you guys play?
Taliesin: I play Barry Allen.
Liam: I play Reverse-Flash. What's his name?
Taliesin: Eobard Thawne.
Liam: Right.
Laura: I play Supergirl!
Travis: I play Tim Garrick.
Taliesin: Jay Garrick.
Travis: Jay Garrick. I wear a tin pail for a helmet.
Matt: It's pretty slick.
Travis: The one Flash I don't know, really.
Matt: Next Halloween, man. Just saying. I'd love a picture of you wearing that hat.
Taliesin: Oh my god!
Ashley: Yes, please.
Matt: Please. It'll be great. And I play Deadshot. Yeah, check it out, it looks really good. They had us all do really intense facial motion capture which is even funnier, considering that my character wears a mask the whole time.
Travis: Did they really make you do that?
Matt: Yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah.
Travis: With a mask?
Matt: Well, not with a mask on my face, but yeah.
Taliesin: That would've been even better.
Matt: I assume there'll be a DLC costume where he doesn't have a mask, or they just did it to fuck with me, which I respect either way.
Travis: They're in the booth, going (whispers) we're not getting any of this!
Taliesin: Don't tell him! Let it roll.
Travis: Just draw a dick-butt on his forehead; it's fine.
Laura: Those bright lights are headache-inducing, yeah.
Matt: So check it out. It's out now, it's fun! What I've seen of it looks actually really cool.
Taliesin: I've played a little; it's fun.
Matt: They got their RPG in my fighting game, and that's right up my alley. All right, also, because it's coming up real fast, reminder, MomoCon, May 25th to the 28th. MoMocon! Taliesin, Marisha, myself, and Brian W. Foster are going to be there for a Talks Machina panel, as well as other events throughout the weekend, so look forward to seeing you there in Atlanta, Georgia, weekend after this one. Also, I will be at A-Kon once again, June 8th to the 11th in Fort Worth, Texas. Come say hello to me there. And then, remember that Talks Machina is live on Tuesdays at 7PM Pacific Time here on Twitch and Alpha. The submission email has changed, so to submit your gif and/or fanart of the week, use submit@talksmachina.com. So that is submit, submit! One submit, not two, that's just my psychosis. Submit@talksmachina.com. Yes. Anything else anyone wants to talk about, are we good? Move on to the game for the night.
Laura: Oh! Farpoint came out. So if you have PlayStation Virtual Reality System, then you can get Farpoint, and I play Dr. Eva Tyson on it, and it's actually a really freaking cool game.
Travis: It's fun, you shoot things with a gun. Do you have to get the gun for it?
Laura: You shoot things with a gun, and it was a really cool script and stuff. I liked the story a lot.
Liam: That's not how guns work.
Taliesin: Are we talking about next week?
Marisha: Are we talking about next week?
Matt: Oh, yeah, we should say that, too.
Marisha: That's a big one.
Matt: That wasn't on the list. So yeah. So we're missing two cast members next week.
Travis: Guess who's not here.
Matt: What? That's terrible.
Ashley: Hey!
Matt: But given the circumstance, instead, we're going to have a non-numbered episode next week, instead it looks like we're going to throw in for a new, higher-level battle royale for those who will be here to see how some of these high-level abilities function.
Marisha: You won't be there to put my face in lava this time! I'll just have myself to do that.
Ashley: I know, you guys, I won't be there, so.
Travis: Will Friedle won the first one, she won the last one.
Laura: I've never done it.
Sam: I've never done it, either.
Laura: Oh no. And you're doing it as Tary?
Matt: It's up to you; you get to choose.
Marisha: Are you going to bring back Scanlan?
Sam: All right, Taryon's going to die in like five seconds. (laughter)
Taliesin: So if we loot Tary's body, do we get all of his stuff?
Matt: It's not in canon.
Taliesin: No, even not in canon, in the game.
Matt: Oh, if you go to his body after he's dead, you can grab any of his shit to use it.
Taliesin: You are a loot drop, oh my god.
Matt: As long as it's not attunement, you can use it.
Laura: Is the helmet attuned? It is, isn't it?
Matt: I believe it is, yes.
Sam: Probably, yeah.
Laura: Too bad. But we can just steal all of his jewels just for the sake of it.
Matt: There you go. In the alternate universe version, you are just decked out.
Sam: Do I get Doty in the fight?
Matt: Yeah.
Sam: Okay. That helps.
Matt: And you'll be leveled up to their level.
Sam: And I'll be leveled up to their level?
Matt: For the battle royale, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, we level up for that.
Matt: Anyway, that'll be next week. That pushes our hundredth episode to June 8th. And it looks like we're confirmed for June 1st for our next guest, I believe.
Sam: Yes. Yes, we are. We are confirmed for that. Are we announcing that?
Matt: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Sam: Oh, well, yeah, on June 1st, our next guest, Jon Heder AKA Napoleon Dynamite, is going to come play with us and roll some dice. Yeah.
Marisha: My mother has never been so proud of me.
Laura: So, did we already say that because next week is a battle royale, that means our hundredth episode--
Matt: Is pushed to the 8th, yes.
Laura: Okay, you already said that? Was I busy rolling dice and talking?
Matt: You were. But thank you, Laura. Good looking out. I appreciate that. So yeah, I think that's all the major news, and given that, let's go ahead and dive in to tonight's episode of Critical Role. [dramatic music]
Matt: Hello and welcome back, everybody. So last time where we left off, Vox Machina, upon working on their bakery, the Slayer's Cake in Whitestone, made a possible new hire who turned out to be a drow bounty hunter named K'rynn, who was sent here to acquire Taryon Darrington and bring him back home to the city of Deastok In Wildmount. You guys all, through a series of high-level magic scrying and transportation, managed to cut off this specific bounty hunter on the outskirts of the city, and in doing so made an agreement to not slay her where she stood, and instead possibly make a transaction down the road. You guys then made your way into the city of Deastok to the Darrington Estate and were led up into the study of Howaardt Darrington, father of Taryon, in which you all discussed the reasons of why he was brought back, the current financial state of the family, and the intent to resolve and remedy long-standing sins of the father, through you standing up and doing your family duty, from his perspective. We left off as you guys had just finished that conversation. You've exited his study and were about to go about your business. Coming off the tension of the conversation, you closed behind you with a clack the heavy wooden doors of Howaardt's study. There you have Bertholt, who's standing off to the side, the dragonborn servant of the Darrington family, waiting patiently, and you all at this moment are at your own disposal. What do you wish to do?
Sam: Just before we move  the names that Dad had told us about to maybe parlay with in the Myriad?
Laura: Korshad.
Sam: Korshad?
Matt: Korshad, yes.
Travis: And how much was the debt? It was 260,000?
Sam: 230,000!
Matt: 230,000 gold debt.
Sam: But wait, wasn't there some other name, the little--
Travis: Lydia!
Matt: Lydia was who you are to be betrothed to, and the location was the Grumpy Lily.
Marisha: I was questioning myself, I was like there was no way something was called the Grumpy Lily.
Matt: Had a stroke while taking notes in D&D. Grumpy Lily!
Laura: The Many is who we want to speak to.
Taliesin: Just as something that happened, during that whole family conversation I was scanning the room and the bookshelves for anything interesting, anything out of sorts, anything out of place.
Matt: Make a retroactive perception check.
Sam: A retroactive perception check!
Taliesin: I didn't want to-- yeah, I didn't see shit. I just rolled a three; that's nothing.
Matt: Rightly so!
Sam: Retrograde! You know they always say that retrograde perception is 20/20?
Matt: What?
Taliesin: I appreciate what you were going for there.
Sam: Anyway, I would love to ask Bertholt if he knows the location of my sister.
Matt: "Well, if you are looking for Maryanne, she's probably in her chambers."
Sam: All right, well, I mean I guess we can all walk to her room and knock on the door. It's a little weird, right?
Liam: You want to go talk to her and touch base with her first? You can introduce us to her after.
Sam: Sure. I'll lead them back downstairs to that main room that was all awful and terrible, right?
Matt: Well, it was just dark and cold and empty.
Sam: So I'll lead them down there. This was our playroom, maybe you should just wait here and I'll go talk to sis. I'll be right back.
Laura: All right.
Travis: Is there like furniture to sit on, or is it barren?
Matt: No, no. There's furniture, and a lot of the furniture here is really well made, dark woods, fine deep red and maroon fabrics. A lot of it has dust on it.
Taliesin: Plastic covers? No plastic covers?
Matt: No plastic covers. But some of the furniture here is for use and some of it is here just as part of the decor, and it's very easy to see which ones are which.
Laura: I'm definitely going to sit on the ones that are just for decor.
Matt: Okay, they're really uncomfortable.
Laura: Cool. Going to rub my butt all over it.
Matt: You leave a little butt-print in the dust. Perfect. At which point, Bertholt acknowledges that you guys will be staying. "Could I get anything for you? Perhaps teas, juice, water?"
Travis: What is this bullshit, no ale?
Laura: Do you have fermented juice?
Matt: "I'll fetch the wine." And he hobbles off to acquire some means of imbibement.
Travis: Should we pay him? We just found out he's dead fucking broke.
Laura: I'd rather not.
Travis: Okay. (laughter)
Matt: Okay. You make your way back to the second floor and off to the far western end of the estate, to what you recall being Maryanne's chambers. So as you enter her room, which has become her own study, as you recall last time seeing her, her room was becoming more and more of a functional office, and as you knock and push the door open like a familiar brother does, not wishing for any patience on her end, necessarily, you can see the interiors. The bed's there for function. Most if it is, I wouldn't say a replica, but it very much resembles the decor and mood of your father's study. You see her currently sitting at a desk in the corner. Her blonde hair is tied back in a tied braid that runs down her back. She wears a coat and pants and seems to be dressed a little formally or businesslike for being casually at home. You haven't really seen her dress like this before, at least not in a casual circumstance. As you glance over past the doorway she looks up from her papers and goes, "Brother!"
Sam: Hello, sister.
Matt: "Brother, what--" She closes the book. You can see she's been looking over ledgers and catalogues. Looks like she's been doing a fair amount of work here at the desk and stands up in a very formal way and begins to step towards you. "When have you arrived?"
Sam: Just today. Father kidnapped me and brought me home.
Matt: "Kidnapped?"
Sam: Well, I'm not a kid, but still works. Abducted. Abducted me and brought me home. Paid someone to do it.
Matt: "Right."
Sam: Yes. Anyway, it's good to see you. Your room is coming along quite nicely. It seems like you're running the show now, is that true?
Matt: "No, not quite, but the responsibilities have definitely been mounting. You look well. How have the wind-tossed roads of Exandria treated you this past year?"
Sam: Well, I have had many adventures and close calls, but I won't bore you with those details. It's been an interesting year abroad, and I would say I'm glad to be back, but for the abduction part and also the fact that I've now learned that we are destitute? Is that true?
Matt: "We're on the path to destitution, yes."
Sam: So it's true; he wasn't just trying to guilt me.
Matt: "Probably both, to be honest. We're in a relatively dire situation compared to our previous long-standing lifestyle choices. We're trying to fix this mess."
Sam: And what would have been your plan had I not arrived today?
Matt: "Well, you were part of the plan. We're trying to figure this out the best we can and given the circumstances, we feel this is probably one of the most viable and least dangerous or risky endeavors in which we can right the family's trajectory."
Sam: By marrying me to some lady I've never met?
Matt: "Oh, you're welcome to meet her. I've met her. I helped to arrange this."
Sam: What is she like?
Matt: "She's very nice. She's very pretty, a bit bookish, which once again would befit you rather well, but let's be honest. This is a political marriage. You do what you want. I mean, there isn't a politician or a lord of this land that hasn't in some way, shape, or form made their own life outside of the family." At that point, you noticed she gets a bit dark and seems to speak with this bit of sarcasm.
Sam: And father's businesses, are they being run the same way? With the same attention to detail?
Matt: "There's been no necessary change to the way business has been done. Other than the transition of some responsibilities, of course." And she gives a slight nod. She's getting a little uncomfortable as this conversation continues.
Sam: Listen, I'm sorry to pop in like this and challenge your judgment, but me marrying this person would solve our problems long-term? Somehow?
Matt: "Marrying into this family, the Truscan lot, would enable us the resources and connections to reacquire the deeds to our land, to reacquire the business elements that we've been in this unnecessary partnership with for some time, and would enable us to once again reclaim complete rulership of our family-controlled lands."
Sam: Do we not own anything anymore?
Matt: "It is a partnership that is quickly sliding into the behest of the Myriad."
Sam: So what is ours now? Anything? Our personal belongings? This home?
Matt: "We still own everything, in partnership. Own solely on our own? Some of the furniture."
Sam: And again, if I do this, what's to say we're not just going to drive up another debt again? Doesn't seem like father or you have been very good at keeping us in the black.
Matt: "I have only been recently brought into this unfortunate circumstance, brother. And you can trust in knowing that in my studies and my time spent here, working with father, being very clear, and very thorough with the mistakes he's made in the past, I will not be doomed to repeat them."
Sam: So you and he are two peas in a pod, yes?
Matt: "Well, he's certainly in need of retiring based on the stress he's put upon himself. It would not be long until I will take over the responsibilities."
Sam: Well, I may poke around and see if there's another way I could help. But before I do, is this fun for you? Do you like running this business, or almost running it?
Matt: "It's certainly a better challenge than many other daughters of lords are given in their time."
Sam: Do you have any friends?
Matt: "Friends come, when the money and power's in place. You know this."
Sam: I do.
Matt: "It's the way the land works."
Sam: Well, I'll leave you to your work, and-- love the decorations. I'm considering the offer and I'll have an answer for you by tomorrow morning.
Matt: "Wonderful." As you begin to make any sort of exit, she catches you and goes, "Brother, your arrival here is a great boon to us. You have the power to change the fate of this family. Consider the respect you have for the people who have worked their entire lives to provide for you what you have been given. Mother and Father sacrificed so much for us. Consider weighing one's selfish interest versus the importance of a bloodline. That is all I ask."
Sam: All right. I'll consider it. With all my intellect.
Matt: "Well, it's good to see you." She steps forward and gives you a half-hug. It's like--
Sam: A pat. The back pat. Good day.
Matt: "Good day." She straightens her coat and sits back behind her desk and waits for you to leave.
Sam: All right. I'll shimmy out. (sighs) All right, I'll rejoin my friends downstairs. Well--
Laura: How did it go?
Liam: Well, yourself.
Sam: As expected. Things are about the same between me and Maryanne.
Laura: Is she still a raging bitch?
Sam: No, she's not raging.
Ashley: I just think it's rather rude that she doesn't want to come down here and meet us.
Sam: She has her work and her--
Liam: Oh, she's not coming down?
Sam: No.
Liam: That's weird.
Sam: I mean, I don't know, she's busy. I guess.
Liam: Okay.
Sam: They're not guest people. They're not dinner party family.
Liam: We picked up on that.
Laura: Not even for people who could help them with their name?
Marisha: Did you mention us or anything else?
Sam: Nope. It didn't come up.
Liam: Did they have any idea what a heavy hitter you are now? The type of people you roll with?
Sam: They said, how have I been? But they don't really give a shit either way.
Marisha: So you didn't even offer up the information?
Sam: If they are not interested in me, why should I be interested in them knowing about me?
Laura: That's a very good point.
Liam: Let's back it up. What are you thinking? Where's your head at? How can we help you?
Sam: I don't know what to do. There's this woman; she's apparently nice and I could go for it and marry her, and then it seems like all my family problems would be okay.
Ashley: Forever?
Marisha: There's no such thing as family problems being okay for forever.
Travis: Really?
Sam: I don't know. I'm sort of curious about talking to the people who are in this contract with my father and seeing if there's any way to wiggle out of it a little bit, but I don't know how to solve everything right now. I also don't know-- I feel a duty, a responsibility to this family, because they are my family.
Marisha: Grog!
Travis: You feel a doodie? The privy is over there! Or over there! Or the front yard beckons.
Taliesin: He may have opened a bottle of wine.
Travis: I'm lost for the rest of this conversation.
Laura: No, we're not drunk, we may have just had a little bit of wine, just a small amount.
Travis: I carved my name into the floor.
Sam: Part of me wants to-- oh god. Part of me wants to turn around and go back with you to Whitestone and forget that the Darringtons exist, but I don't think I can't do that. I am a Darrington and I owe it at least to my name to try and fix what I can.
Laura: That's your plan?
Sam: Yes.
Laura: Don't sacrifice your entire life for this, though.
Sam: Well, I'll try not to, but it seems like a plan B at this point.
Liam: Also, you had no prior knowledge to your family's connection to the mob?
Sam: No? It's way cooler than I thought my family ever was. I knew my dad did shady business with lots of shady characters but I never knew-- I assumed he paid off people. I assumed he had friends in high places and people who you'd have to bribe to turn the other cheek, but I never knew that he was in business with them, owing our whole existence to these terrible people, and I don't know what to make of that
Liam: T, I think we're all prepared to help you do anything you want to do, but are you sure you want to help perpetuate the family business?
Sam: Definitely not. Listen, I think there's two steps to this: there's the short term and the long term. We have to solve this short-term need really quickly. Not this whole 230,000-dollar-- I mean -gold debt. It's a Whitestone term, I mean a Wildmount. Oh my god. My phone rang! I'm confused! Anyway, listen, couple drinks before-- no. We have a short-term problem that we can maybe go alleviate a bit if we go talk to these folk at the Laughing Ninny or whatever it's called. The Grumpy Lily.
Liam: I like the Laughing Ninny. I kinda want to go there instead.
Taliesin: It's a stand-up comedy club. (laughter)
Sam: And then there's a long-term problem which I'll have to solve on another day. There's a long- term problem that my family is awful and needs to be stopped at all costs, and that's something that I'll have to deal with tomorrow.
Laura: Do the Truscans, that's who you are being married into potentially, do they have a son?
Taliesin: That doesn't help! That's almost beside the point!
Sam: You're talking about marrying the sister? Yeah.
Taliesin: Oh, that's still--
Laura: I guess it's not the same, is it?
Taliesin: No! Actually, it's unfortunately the opposite.
Sam: You're royalty. You know this!
Laura: Of course, I know everything about royalty.
Sam: Little royal girl.
Marisha: What exactly is your duty that you are feeling inclined towards? Damn it, Grog!
Taliesin: Lilah? Is it Lilah?
All: Lydia.
Taliesin: Perhaps we should talk to this Lydia as well, because she is obviously in a position of being told what she is going to do with herself.
Marisha: Yeah! Maybe she's also a badass!
Liam: At the very least, we should meet all the chess pieces on the board, right?
Sam: I mean, she lives in another part of the kingdom, right, Matthew Mercer?
Marisha: That's not a problem.
Sam: Oh yes, that's true. But there's the in-town people we can meet first.
Laura: Sure. Let's talk to the mob!
Sam: Yes, of course! You'll come with me? Because I can't talk to the mob by myself.
Laura: Tary, of course we will!
Travis: Wait, when you said we need to stop your family at all costs, are you talking about killing them?
Sam: No, I'm not talking about killing them.
Marisha: Yeah, but Grog does bring up a point that I was trying to make before he started laughing when I said "duty." (giggles) But what, are you committed to keeping your family around? You said you were compelled and you felt like you had a duty but then you immediately started talking about--
Taliesin: Stop it, Travis! God, I can't--
Marisha: Tearing your family apart? And stopping them?
Sam: My family is pretty bad, I've learned. But I've also learned from young Trickfoot that even a rotten family is worth trying to save. And I admire the path that she took with her family, and I would like to at least try to push mine in the right direction and try to make our name a little less shitty.
Liam: That is a pretty big matzo ball, my friend.
Sam: Well, that's why that's long term. In the short term, I just want to get them safe.
Marisha: If there's one thing I understand, it's giving your life to a cause.
Sam: I don't want to die, if that's what you're saying.
Marisha: No.
Sam: Dedicating.
Marisha: Dedicating.
Sam: Thank you.
Marisha: Time is a gift, I would say.
Sam: Sure.
Marisha: So dedicating that gift is, it's a big thing, but I hope you believe in it.
Sam: I don't believe in them, but I believe in the cause right now, and we'll see how far that takes us.
Marisha: We believe in you.
Sam: You guys.
Travis: Can you describe to me this duty?
Marisha: You don't care!
Travis: I think I do now. Is it real hard?
Sam: It's a little more nebulous than that, Grog.
Taliesin: We can pass on this for now.
Travis: Adjectives are not my strong suit, so.
Laura: You know what an adjective is! That's impressive.
Travis: Yeah. No, I got it one time at this tavern. I had it for two nights. It just itched everywhere.
Sam: Listen. When you see my duty, you'll know.
Travis: Copy that.
Liam: It's loose. This duty is loose.
Laura: Should we go to the Grumpy Lily, then?
Taliesin: Please.
Laura: This is going so well.
Matt: As you're exiting the house and Berthold's opening the door, you hear some heavy creaking from the stair that leads down to the main area, and you watch as an older woman in her early fifties or so with her mid-length, curly brown hair in shades of gray, green eyes behind a small set of reading spectacles, stoic of face, wearing what looks to be some sort of a finely crafted silk robe, clutching a book under her arm, comes down the steps and looks down and goes, "Taryon?"
Sam: Mama?
Matt: "Taryon, my boy!" And she sets the book down and walks up, puts her hands out as she says, "Oh," takes you at the sides of the face and pulls you in for (kisses). "Oh, terribly sorry. I didn't realize that we had guests."
Sam: Oh, yes, these are my allies and my friends. This is the team known as Vox Machina. They are a fearless band of adventurers and they have taken me in as their own.
Matt: "Look at you, so rugged!"
Sam: Well. Yes, I am, a bit!
Matt: "So you've had some adventures with my boy, have you?"
All: We have.
Matt: "That's wonderful. Have you spoken with your father?"
Sam: Yes, I've spoken to Father, and Sister, and it's good to know they're healthy. And it's lovely to see you, as well. Have you been happy at all, this last year?
Matt: "I--" And she reaches back and takes the book off the step and goes, "I've been making my way through your library."
Sam: Oh! Oh, my books, in my room.
Matt: "Yes! Well, I've had a lot of time to myself. Been a bit under the weather for some time, and these have kept me fine company."
Sam: Oh. That's lovely. I hope you've enjoyed them as much as I did. What's your favorite one?
Matt: "Well, not this piece of trash." And she sets it down. "There's one. What was it called? The River's Dawn. It was a brilliant--"
Sam: Before the River's Dawn, yes.
Matt: "Before the River's Dawn! That one, yes. It was a continuation of the creation myth of Wildmount, but it turned into the spirits of the gods, these two fauns, and they fell in love but could not be together because the dawn had to rise and the sun would shine. It was very, very beautiful!"
Sam: Yes, yes! No it was, but also heartbreaking at the same time.
Matt: "Very much so. It reminded me of you."
Sam: Yes. That's one of my favorites, as well.
Matt: "Well. I didn't break the binding too much, I hope."
Sam: I'll fix it if you did. It's all right.
Matt: "All right."
Sam: Well, that's wonderful to hear. I'm glad you've been entertaining yourself. I know living with Papa can be very hard, and it's been very hard on you all these years.
Matt: "If you would excuse us for just a moment, please. Just a few moments." And she points towards the door.
Sam: I told you they were like this.
Travis: Yeah, no, we're going out the front door. Front yard.
Marisha: Bottle of wine!
Matt: Berthold is leading you out of the main area, out the front door.
Travis: Yeah, front door!
Laura: Out the house, like get out?
Matt: You guys were on your way out.
Sam: Just wait on the fucking porch!
Liam: We got it.
Laura: Fine.
Matt: As soon as she has some privacy with you, she goes, "My boy, if you could indulge me in some strange honesty, I'm rather intrigued at this idea. I don't wish to undermine anything that we've built as a family. I've lived a privileged life for a very long time, far longer than you and your sister have. I've lived within this house, removed from the world. I do as responsibility asks of me, my wedded duties as both a wife and a mother, and I do so without complaint. I have always seen you fight these same circumstances bravely, and I find vicarious joy in your escape from this place this past year. These books are a reminder of that same bravery. I know Howaardt has said many things, and he may be right. But there's a little part of me that welcomes a little change in scenery and lifestyle. Maybe that's what the family needs. I don't know. Perhaps I'm foolhardy. I know not."
Sam: No, you're right to think this way. This year has been eye-opening for me, and I know that you care for Papa, and you are a diligent and faithful wife. But I know how hard it must have been to live this life for so many years and I wonder what it would be like if you hadn't been with him, what kind of person you would be.
Matt: "Looking at you, looking at your sister, I wouldn't change it for the world."
Sam: Well, things are going to have to change at some point, right?
Matt: "One way or another. I just-- (sighs) I just want you to make choices for yourself. I want you to do what you think is right, that you could live with. Duty and blood is one thing, but... Anyway, I'm talking out of turn."
Sam: No. Thank you. Thank you for that.
Matt: "Could you not tell Howaardt we've had this conversation?"
Sam: Mum's the word. All right. I'll be back, and maybe we'll have time to talk more books later.
Matt: "I would like that very much."
Sam: Good evening.
Matt: "Good evening." As you leave, she's like, "Oh! The other one I was trying to remember was The Mountain Range of Gold. It was a wonderful three-part series--"
Sam: When you think he's dead, but he's not, and he comes back?
Matt: "Well, the second book, you get halfway through it before he even turns and reveals himself!"
Sam: I know! Well, you never see the body in the first one, so that should have been a tip-off.
Matt: "And then the white robes and everything! His renewed power, it's incredible! Anyway, I'm sorry, you have your friends waiting on you. Good night, Taryon."
Sam: Yes.
Liam: I want to adopt her.
Marisha: She's awesome!
Matt: So as you step out to greet the rest of your friends?
Sam: All right, let's go to the Jumping Jimmy, or whatever it's called.
Laura: How's your mother?
Sam: She's better. I mean, she's had a tough time. That was the longest conversation I've had with her in many years.
Laura: Wow.
Ashley: She said she's under the weather. What's wrong?
Sam: I think everybody's super stressed out and heartsick about everything that's happening, and living under a tyrant of a father is not healthy. You should have seen me when I lived here. I was not nearly as dashing or as charming as I am now. It took me spreading my wings and flying before I found my sense of humor. My hair looks better, my eyes look better.
Marisha: I thought you said that was because of the aloe vera.
Sam: Well, yes. We didn't have any at home.
Marisha: Right, yeah. Salt air is better for you.
Sam: I mean, life needs aloe to live. Is something I always say.
Taliesin: That's true.
Liam: I've heard you say that two or three times.
Sam: Moisturizing products in general. Life needs moisturizing products to live.
Taliesin: Life needs moisture to live.
Ashley: I know my beauty regimen's changed.
Marisha: Life needs moisture to live. It's way smarter-sounding.
Taliesin: All right, gauntlet dropped.
Laura: All right, to the Laughing Ninny it is.
Matt: All right. Who's leading this charge? Probably you, Taryon.
Sam: I know the place.
Liam: You are in charge while we're here.
Matt: You've never been to this place. You've heard of it, but you'd never be seen dead in a place like this before. You lead your way in. At this point, because when you arrived the sun was still in the sky, but it was deep in the sky, so by now it's post-dusk. You now see the massive stone and wood structures of Deastok are dark against the ever-dark sky with the windows now aglow, this warm yellows and orange of the candle and lantern-lit interiors. You can see there are hanging lanterns that are put out there, and you can see a number of individuals who seem to work for the city, who go and place these lanterns up in each of these poles, are now finishing their job and are returning to the evening. Following these lamps, along the street, the cobblestones are still really well kept for as old as this town seems to be. For a city that isn't a major metropolis within a kingdom, and what your experience has been in Tal'Dorei, a fair amount of money still makes it way through this city. Eventually, you find your way fairly far north into the city until you come across the exterior of the Grumpy Lily. Asking a few questions to guide you to which building it is, it's much smaller than you expected. You see what appears to be a single-story pub with one window, one door, no more than maybe 30 feet on any given side. It is lit from the inside, though it's dimly lit. As you approach and push past the somewhat ajar entryway, you see before you what appears to be three tables. Three singular, stained, brown tables. One lone patron sits at the center table, an elderly man inspecting a small, clay sculpture that he's enraptured by, and a single barkeep to your right that seems to notice your entry. A healthy, pale woman of brunette hair in her forties, dressed in a simple gray blouse. As soon as you enter and take in the atmosphere, she goes, "Slow day, folks! Happy to have the business! What can I get you?"
Liam: Jeez, Grog, I don't even know if you're going to fit in here.
Travis: Yeah, it's really tiny.
Matt: Your head does reach the ceiling.
Travis: Shit.
Laura: Just dive in then?
Sam: Should we get anything to drink first? Or just dive in?
Travis: Yeah, it's like how you have to buy something to use the restroom.
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz? I was just wondering if you had any imports. Do you have a red wine?
Matt: "Yes! That I can get for you, dear. Don't worry. Red wine we can do definitely." She walks over and slams her hand on the side of the bar and what you thought was once the patron now appears to be the one barman there. "Wait! What! Oh. I missed the conversation."
Travis: Oh the guy with the sculpture?
Matt: Yeah. "Red wine, for our guests." "Oh." He stands up and begrudgingly walks over. You see his back is hunched forward and he's (pained grunting). Leaves the room for a second. "Well, sit down, find a place wherever you like."
Sam: Put two tables together, I guess?
Laura: All three, really.
Marisha: Let's just take them all.
Travis: Wait, this is the meeting place of a dark group, right? A shady group? Shouldn't we check this area for anything shady?
Taliesin: Is there shade in this establishment?
Matt: It's dimly lit, so there's plenty of shadows.
Liam: It's a five-by-five square. Do we see anything amiss? Oh, that's terrible. 24.
Matt: Nothing seems amiss. It seems like a shitty pub. It's the definition of a poorly attended dive.
Laura: Does it look like there's any seams in the ground that would be a trapdoor or anything?
Matt: You can make an investigation check if you want to.
Laura: 17.
Matt: You begin to look around the floor and keep perspective around the area. No. You see some stains, you see some crumbs, and at one point you look over in the corner and you see what appears to be a piece of stale bread that's been left under one of the tables and there are three rats currently eating it. As soon as you lean in, they all stop and look at you and scatter.
Laura: Oh, you can keep going.
Taliesin: Could be worse. They could not be afraid of you.
Laura: That's true.
Matt: (laughs) They just give you the fuck-you look and keep eating their bread.
Taliesin: That's when you know you've really found the right bar. The rats were like: "We reserved this table two weeks ago. You have to make a phone call."
Matt: The elderly barman walks in now and he's got two bottles of red wine and he's shuffling. (grunts, clinks) "I'll get your cups." Turns around and starts shuffling back.
Laura: (laughing) Do you need any help?
Marisha: I mean we have-- Oh, it's fine.
Taliesin: Just let it happen.
Sam: Okay. Who do you think we proposition here? The old man?
Liam: That guy.
Sam: That guy? Really? What makes you say that?
Taliesin: Shifty eyes.
Liam: Shifty yeah, may be an act, even.
Sam: He's just old I thought. No?
Laura: Nobody's just old.
Liam: He's many things.
Marisha: That's true, look at Pike's grandpa.
Liam: Look at Pike.
Ashley: Look at me.
Liam: How old are you, again?
Ashley: 142.
Liam: I said goddamn.
Sam: Is that true?
Ashley: No.
Sam: Oh. (laughter)
Sam: Oh. Well, because you could be.
Ashley: I forgot my birthday. I don't know how old I am.
Sam: Is it in the hundreds?
Ashley: No. I think it's in the 30s.
Sam: Oh, okay.
Ashley: Right?
Matt: Whatever you want.
Ashley: Yeah.
Liam: You ain't no baby.
Matt: The gentleman shuffles back now with a bunch of cups. His hands wrung through all the various handles. (grunts, clicks)
Laura: Impressive.
Matt: (grunts) "Two gold for both bottles."
Laura: I give him two gold.
Matt: "Thank you."
Laura: You're welcome.
Sam: In my earring, I say to Vex  I'm clamming up, you do it.
Laura: Sir?
Matt: You see him walking and he goes like (sighs).
Laura: On your way to the back, could you tell the Many we'd like to speak to them?
Matt: He slowly turns his head over to the bartender, the woman. "What was that?"
Laura: Oh, just a conversation with the Many.
Matt: "What about them?"
Liam: I dip my thumb into some wine and I use thieves' cant and write "discuss" in wine on the bar.
Matt: (click) She gives a click noise to the old man, who goes (groan, thump) Are you going to take your bottles or what?
Laura: No, yeah, we'll definitely keep those.
Matt: "All right, pick them up. Follow me."
Taliesin: Oh, we're going to get to see the real bar.
Matt: He turns around and shuffles out. It's like following a bad, slow NPC in World of Warcraft. You're like, just go fucking faster! His pace is terrible. Yeah, it's awful.
Laura: Running ahead, turning around.
Matt: Exactly, just waiting.
Travis: Over here, adventurer!
Matt: Eventually, he takes you out of the small pub, past the unused kitchen, which has another series of stale bread clumps on the side, down to what looks to be a broom closet. He gets there to the edge of the broom closet and pulls out a key ring.
Laura: I want to pay attention to what key he's taking.
Marisha: Can I take the bread crumbs from the corner and throw it down so the rats could have it?
Matt: Sure. So you walk over to the kitchen and grab some of the bread crumbs and throw them down on the ground and you wait there, because there's no rats present. And you're like, bread crumbs. They scatter a little further out. You turn around and the minute you turn, in the air you hear (skittering) and look over, and there's like seven rats that just scurried out of the shadows and are just going at these crumbs immediately.
Travis: I kill all of them.
Laura: Sploosh!
Liam: I nudge my sister and say, all mine.
Laura: Yes. That she is.
Matt: He pulls one key and unlocks the small closet. You paid attention? (creak) Opens this rickety wooden door, and goes (grunt) and walks past, and he's behind the door, expectantly waiting. You guys glance into the space, and you can see there's what looks to be a low torchlight about every ten feet down a wooden stairway that descends about 30, 40 feet.
Liam: Traps, people hiding, anything that seems out of place or dangerous.
Matt: Traps, or people hiding?
Liam: Traps.
Laura: I'll look for people hiding.
Matt: Perception check, investigation check.
Laura: 24.
Liam: 24.
Marisha: Twinsies!
Ashley: Twinsies!
Matt: Look at that. That's disgusting. All right, so you guys make your way down. No traps in the stair descent, but you make your way to the bottom of the stairs without issue. You don't see anything necessarily fishy. You do see these torches have been burning for a little bit, a couple hours, and are probably needing to be re-upped pretty soon. You guys eventually make your way down, and as soon as the last of you-- who's following up the rear in this, by the way? What's the marching order?
Sam: I'll go toward the front with the twins?
Matt: The hallway here is about big enough for you to go single file.
Laura: Okay. You'll hang behind me, Tary?
Ashley: I'm in front of Grog.
Marisha: Yeah, I'll hang with Grog and Pike.
Taliesin: I'm in the center, as well.
Travis: I'm in the back.
Matt: Okay, so Grog's in the very back. Keyleth, Percy.
Laura: Pike is with Grog.
Matt: Yeah, Pike's with Grog. So we'll say, Grog in the back, then Pike, then Keyleth, then Percy, then Taryon?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: And Vex and Vax. And you have Trinket in your necklace, I assume? Okay. All right, so you guys descend down the stairway. As soon as, Grog, you make your way in, it's tiny. You have to (straining) squeeze in and duck low and even just walking through the pathway, your shoulders are rubbing against the sides of the wall, and your head occasionally (bang, bang).
Laura: It's like you in Japan, baby!
Travis: I know. Taking a shower, I broke like two shower heads. Just turning around, I was like (crash).
Liam: The beds, was that like lying down on a saltine for you?
Travis: Oh yeah. My heels were just over like the--
Laura: We went into McDonald's and his head hit the ceiling!
Matt: You are a kaiju!
Ashley: A kaiju from the deep! A level seven!
Marisha: Okay, wait, before we go any further.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: Wait.
Travis: Oh my god. Holy shit. Before we go any further, wait.
Marisha: Do I have to be doing a short rest to do the Inspiring Leader thing?
Matt: It's ten minutes, it takes to do.
Marisha: Oh, never mind.
Laura: Well, no, we could stand here for ten minutes!
Travis: Yeah, no, please. Fucking say some words!
Marisha: I'm new to the being an inspiring leader thing.
Matt: Yeah, it's ten minutes, before you know you're going to go into something, you stop and do this.
Marisha: I should've done that at the bar.
Liam: Wouldn't that be cool if you were just pep-talking us all the way down here?
Sam: Start it now.
Laura: Yeah, start it now! Just do it while we're walking!
Marisha: Okay, okay. As we walk I'll be like  You know what, guys? I've had a lot of time to think over the year that we've been away--
Matt: The door closes behind Grog and you hear it lock.
Marisha: And I feel like we've grown so much as people, and you guys are family. You're a family to me. And I go on for a while. Do you guys remember that time in Stillben? When we very first met, and we all didn't really like each other, and Grog, I don't think you understood me for a while.
Travis: Still don't.
Marisha: Yeah, that's fine. That's fair. Hey Grog, do you remember that one time--
Matt: This is great, by the way, because at the bottom of the stairs it only goes for about 15 more feet before there's a door. There's a man on a stool who's just sitting there going--
Liam: She'll just be another minute.
Travis: I'm about to find out what the inside of a Bag of Holding feels like, I swear.
Matt: He's not stopping you.
Marisha: Do you remember that time-- I think it was the first time I made you laugh, and I turned into an earth elemental, and then pretended to do an "I'm going down the stairs" thing through the floor?
Travis: Oh yeah!
Marisha: Yeah, I just remembered that the other day, and I just love you guys so much, you know?
Taliesin: I don't feel included in this.
Marisha: Yeah, I don't think you were around yet. But I love you so much!
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel better. That's all.
Sam: Any change in our bodies or anything?
Liam: She's going for ten in-game, real-time minutes.
Matt: As you guys are all in the hallway, Grog at the back, you can't move forward, because everyone's stopped, and you're just like-- (groan) All of you who wish to can take 17 temporary hit points. That's by the inspiring leader feat.
Marisha: Oh yeah, you want to mock until you realize you get your hit points!
Matt: It is your choice as to whether or not you felt inspired by that and take them.
Marisha: And I love you guys. I love you guys so much.
Matt: Grog's too uncomfortable to take them.
Travis: No, I just start weeping silently in the back.
Liam: I mean, let's be honest, he wouldn't even feel the difference.
Matt: That's true, yeah. That's what Grog needs, is temporary hit points.
Liam: Grog would just go (sneezes).
Marisha: Not showing your sensitivity?
Laura: Thanks. Thanks, Keyleth. That felt good. That was a nice trip down memory lane.
Ashley: I feel inspired.
Laura: Oh, hey! How's it going there?
Matt: You see this guy, he's tough and surly, looks like a balding man who's just like made of muscle and anger. He's sitting there with one eye open, one a little squinted, he's just--
Laura: Do you feel inspired? No.
Liam: Not the warm and fuzzy type, are you?
Matt: He doesn't seem to respond. You do hear like a series of muffled voices and what sounds like a faint beat of some kind from the other side of the wall, just muffled.
Taliesin: Is the password, "I am what I am," not sure? Too strange a reference; never mind.
Matt: He begins to reach over for what looks to be a small lever that's hidden on the side.
Laura: We're here to speak to the Many.
Matt: Stops. (grunts)
Sam: We're in.
Laura: We're going to just go on in, then.
Sam: That word just gets us in.
Matt: So. As you guys enter this doorway, as it pushes open, you're immediately hit with a wall of voices and laughter and conversation, interweaving in multiple languages. This is far more lively than you expected it would be, it's a large tavern hall. It's almost two stories tall, but it's open. There's a central, circular chandelier that hangs over with what looks to be flickering candles in a circle around it. You can see elements of what are almost like a second floor, but it's more like a slight balcony outcropping. You don't see any doorways, it's just a level platform above, and there before you, you see what has to be three or four dozen people scattered across a number of tables, all in various forms of dress and many of them are drinking, some of them are playing games of chance, some of them are in deep conversation. You can see, the music-- though this is a bad example, but it's what I have-- it's not a full band, per se. It looks like there's a set of three percussionists in the far corner that are all in the process of weaving this rhythmic beat that shifts and changes. Some of them are on more of a hand drum, some of them are more small percussion instruments. It's interesting. It's not the usual bar atmosphere you're used to. It has almost a weird--
Sam: Would you say more like Blue Man Group or more like a subway bucket drummer?
Matt: I'd say it's in between the two, actually. Take a little Blue Man Group and a little bit of subway bucket drummer. It's right in between there. You guys step into the chamber and take in the atmosphere a bit. Whether that be with smiles, awe, or confusion and care.
Taliesin: That's exactly what I said, the real bar.
Ashley: I like this.
Liam: This is like old times.
Matt: As soon as you begin having this conversation and taking in the atmosphere, one of four bar hands sees you approach. You see a jagged smile of a hairless man with ruddy skin that immediately comes up to you. "Aye, friends! New faces are few and far between here in Deastok. Welcome to our little slice of the family. What can I get you?"
Sam: Well, we brought bottles. That's rude, isn't it?
Laura: The good stuff is down here.
Matt: "I don't know where you got that shit but put that away. We'll get you right fucked up, eh?"
Marisha: Do you have a shiraz?
Matt: "I'll see what I can muster."
Marisha: I like these people!
Matt: "Slim pickings for room here. It's a bit early in the evening. That's when it's the busiest. Just find some space, sit down. Folks don't want you to sit by them? Don't fucking sit by them."
Laura: Thank you. Do we see room for a large group?
Matt: You see two tables that have room for half of a large group.
Laura: All right. Split up?
Sam: Why don't we ask them nicely if they would like to move?
Laura: No, let's not do that.
Travis: Yeah, no. You do that. Go by yourself.
Sam: No?
Taliesin: No. This is special.
Travis: How about the talkers go to one table?
Marisha: And then the defenders go to another in case shit goes bad. I like that.
Travis: The Defenders' Table. Yeah, so I'm going to the talkers' table.
Laura: Yeah, obviously.
Marisha: Vex, Tary, I feel like you guys are good talkers.
Laura: Right.
Taliesin: I'll join you.
Liam: I'm actually going to wander the room.
Marisha: I'll sit with Grog and Pike.
Travis: Yeah.
Ashley: Yeah, Shiraz time.
Laura: All right.
Sam: What's our play here? Do we just keep saying the word "many" as many times as we can and see how far it goes?
Laura: This is about as in as we get with the Many.
Sam: This is it? So now we ask for her by name? Or him by name? Korshad?
Laura: Yeah. He or she may not reveal themselves too quickly.
Sam: All right.
Taliesin: We could buy Korshad a drink.
Laura: That is a beautiful idea.
Taliesin: Thank you.
Laura: Care of one Taryon Darrington.
Sam: Of course. I have just enough for a nice drink.
Laura: Oh, we'll cover the drink, darling. Party funds cover the drink. It's just in your name.
Sam: Oh. Oh, okay. All right. All right. I'm slow to catch on sometimes.
Laura: Can we grab a barmaid?
Matt: You split between the two tables. One of the tables appears to be three guys who are in a card game. As soon as you sit down they (grunts) and then keep talking amongst themselves more about taking bets, bluffing each other, giving shit about their home lives, stuff like that. The other table has four quiet individuals that are, look to be elvish lineage. Either half-elf or full elf; it's hard to tell. They're wearing these hoods that show the ears from underneath but then seem to block a lot of the features of their face and guard a lot of the forehead. This silk hood that drips down past the nose on the sides.
Laura: Do we recognize any semblance of that garb?
Matt: Make a history check.
Sam: History check.
Laura: Well, my history is shit, but 19.
Matt: 19. You haven't seen this kind of dress, but you've heard of it. It seems to be of Wildmount but the eastern side of Wildmount, not a part of the Dwendalian Empire. This more stems from Zorhaus, which is the other kingdom on the continent. It's actually in a tense existence along the border of the Dwendalian Empire.
Laura: You said it was to the east?
Matt: Zorhaus, I'm pretty sure that's what it's called.
Laura: It is now.
Matt: It is! It's whatever it's called in the campaign guide.
Laura: Oh! Oh man, that's right. Now you have to stick to what you wrote. That's crazy.
Matt: I know, I'll just have to look it up again. But anyway. As soon as you sit down at the table the four individuals look at each other and then get up from the table and then walk off to find another place.
Laura: Maybe some of us don't smell very good in this group. I'm not one of them, though. I smell amazing.
Liam: I smell fucking fantastic, and I'm over there. I am going to laze about the musicians and listen to the musicians and wait for them to finish a set.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: I guess all of us can sit at the table because of the people--
Matt: All of you guys can sit at the table now that you've forced them off their own space. The guys playing the card game seemed to pay no mind. As you sit around the table, the barhand that met you here approaches and once more goes, "All right, looks like you've found a place to sit, what can I get you? Got you that shiraz you were asking for, eh." He goes ahead and he pulls up what looks to be a dark green bottle, already uncorked and he brings over a hefty metallic goblet or tankard and then pours it in there. It appears to be something akin to a shiraz, I suppose. Fills it to the top, slides it forward. "All right. Drinks for anyone else, eh?"
Travis: Yeah, you got any pies or meat or both?
Taliesin: To drink.
Travis: Do they not have food?
Laura: No, probably.
Matt: "I can get you a meat pie, if that's what you're asking. I don't recommend you drink it, though you could probably squeeze water from a stone, so wouldn't surprise me if you could."
Travis: Yeah, meat pie and an ale, please.
Matt: "All right, coming on up. Anyone else?"
Laura: Whiskey?
Taliesin: Same.
Matt: "It can be done. So whiskey. And you, little one?"
Ashley: Well, you said you have things that will fuck you up right, so what would that be considered?
Matt: "Oh, I mean no offense, lady, but you're a bit small-sized--"
All: Whoa!
Matt: "I mean that respectfully! Look, I'm just looking out for my patrons here. I don't want to go ahead and send someone to the local temple."
Laura: She can drink most people under the table.
Ashley: Bring it!
Matt: "All right. I'll take your word for it, then."
Sam: I'll have another shiraz.
Matt: "Another shiraz."
Liam: Over the earring  Pickle, will you get me one of those, as well, and don't drink it before I come back?
Ashley: As a matter of fact, I want two of whatever that is.
Matt: "All right, coming up." And he leaves the table.
Taliesin: Did you order the drink for when he comes back?
Sam: Oh the other drink? Oh fuck. Wait, before he goes, pardon me. I have one more order to make. I would like to buy a drink for Korshad, courtesy of Taryon Darrington. And I'll slip him a gold piece.
Travis: I thought you were about to shake his hand with two fingers.
Sam: There is a coin between the two fingers.
Matt: "Korshad, you say?"
Sam: Yes.
Matt: "All right."
Laura: I nudge him under the table.
Matt: "You want what he likes, it's going to cost you more than that."
Laura: What does he like?
Sam: Whatever it is, here is another four and keep another one for yourself.
Matt: "Thank you very much. That'll put you up to yours, though. We will go ahead and settle your bills at the end of the drinks. But all right, Korshad it is."
Taliesin: What table did the bartender look at when he said that?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Oh, I was planning on totally watching that, too.
Taliesin: Yeah, that's a safe 13.
Laura: Should I roll, too?
Matt: Well, you said you were looking, too, so roll a perception, yeah.
Laura: Well yeah, okay. 30.
Matt: 30, okay. You gather the direction that he glanced. It was a cursory look, more to see if the individual in question was still in the room or not. But you got the direction of it, and you know exactly where he was looking-- three tables and that way there. He leaves for a bit, and the laughter is still rising and falling throughout the room. The musicians in the corner, which are two younger human boys and what appears to be a female goliath, who has the heavier drum in the center, who is like the mid-piece, the big (heavy drum noises). The two guys, one of them has a small set of lap drums, (light drum noises) the faster beats. And the guy to the left of her-- they could be brothers; you're not too sure, their features are similar but different enough, the ages seem off. The guy on the left has a series of small wooden blocks and what looks to be some sort of contraption that has three or four different small percussion instruments that are all fixed to it and so he is leaping between them all. For being just percussion, that variety is still making a cool melody. You're still able to find certain notes and certain blends where it still is a very different and unique atmosphere. They manage to bring to this crescendo the piece that you entered on, and it finishes. There is no real-- there is occasionally a couple of claps here and most everyone is busy about their own shit.
Liam: All right, I clap. Excuse me, players?
Matt: As they're both looking over to grab a drink to stop and the younger guy with a scruffy chin and this mop of hair that's a little wild glances over to you: "Yeah?"
Liam: That was a really unique piece you guys just did there. Thank you.
Matt: "You're welcome."
Liam: You know, I have only ever heard music like that one time, and it wasn't here. It wasn't in this city, it was actually in Emon. What was his name? Dranzel. It was a musician named Dranzel-- this is a long shot, but you haven't come across a Dr. Dranzel in your travels? I've always wanted to hear him play again.
Matt: "Can't say I have, sir. My apologies."
Liam: Oh, shit.
Matt: "Sorry. You guys ever heard of Dr. Dranzel?" And the other guy goes, "Nope."
Liam: Orcish. Stylish hats.
Matt: The goliath woman is sitting there and she is just staring off across the room and goes, "No." (laughter)
Matt: "Sorry, friend."
Laura: I'm keeping an eye on the side of the room that he glanced in, looking for anybody going and delivering drinks to the people.
Matt: Okay. You watch the gentleman who has been getting you guys drinks, and he is in the process of getting all of your various drink orders and pouring what you have requested, and he does come to a point where he gets this one fine jewel goblet that he has specifically set off to the side and he takes it and washes it and takes care to clean it entirely and dry it off, and once it's set there he reaches underneath, counting a few bottles and pulls one drink, uncorks it and there is this thick dark brown glass jug and as he uncorks it he pours it into there, glances over, grabs another thing, seems to be mixing it with something else. He is being very careful with the actual amounts he is pouring. He finishes that, takes a piece of what looks like an orange, crushes it in the inside and leaves the rind and takes it and swishes it for a second. (sighs) And walks over to a table across the entire hall, where you saw him glance before.
Sam: One sex on the beach! (laughter)
Matt: He walks over to a table where you see what appear to be about five different patrons at the table. Most of them wealthily dressed. Two of them appear to be older mercantile or business owners, they wear the jewelry on their hands very extravagantly and displaying both wealth and prestige to an ostentatious way that you know most high-end guild workers or owners tend to display. You are very familiar with caste systems that have emerged in a lot of these central metropolitan areas, and so you can very easily pick up some of those themes. Two of them appear as a contrast very simply dressed. No jewelry. You can't make out any details in this distance and there is one man who he hands the drink to, he sets it down in front of him and slides it forward. The man you see there, he has deep brown skin, marked, there appear to be a number of tattoos that curl up his arms and up the side of his neck and touch his ears on each side. He's wearing light, billowing clothes of silver and maroon silks that end about the elbow and are just hanging beneath, leaving the rest of his arm completely visible where you can see the tattoo continues up the forearm and grasps the back of the hand, almost like he has a gauntlet on that is just his skin. You see around him a series of gold and silver bracelets and rings that adorn his fingers. His face is framed by a lion's mane of black and gray dreadlocked hair. Because of your perception check, at this distance and your ranger-like eyes, you can see what you perceive to be a visible scar on his throat from ear to ear. He's currently mid-conversation with the patrons at the table, leaned back in his chair in a comfortable setting and as soon as the drink-- huh?
Laura: Can I read his lips?
Matt: Sure. Well, the drink arrives and gets pushed forward and you read the barkeep's lips as he says, "This drink is a gift to you from patrons on the other side of the place." And this individual, who you assume at this point is probably Korshad, gives a look and goes, (grunts). And he points over, right over to your table across the room. You watch as Korshad sits up, glances over your direction, sees you looking at him directly. Takes the drink, scoots it over next to his side, and folds his fingers and goes back into listening to the conversation of the other patrons. And the barkeep who is standing there is, "Right." And then goes back to the bar, gathers the rest of your drinks and brings them slowly over to your table and passes them out. "All right, got a second shiraz, for you there, sir. We've got a whiskey, and a whiskey. We got an ale and a meat pie for you. And you, well--" (laughs) He brings up these two mugs. They're simple ceramic mugs that are dark and handcrafted, and he sloshes them up to you and as you see inside, most ale has a good liquidy content. This has a very syrupy thick texture to it. He slides both forward and goes, "I don't expect you to drink both those back to back."
Ashley: Well, that's not up for you to decide, my friend. I get on my earring. Hey, String Bean, your drink is here.
Liam: Yeah, and Sarenrae will know if you drink it before I get back, so just hold onto it for me.
Ashley: Well, I can't make any promises.
Matt: And he leans forward and goes, "This here is the Change-Bringer's Nectar. You sip this, slowly."
Laura: The Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Marisha: Write that shit down. Can Keyleth get up and walk past the diplomats' table and run my hands--
Matt: Well, you guys are all at the same table now.
Marisha: Oh, we're at the same table now?
Matt: Yeah, one table got up as soon as you sat down.
Marisha: Oh, so we scootched together? Okay, then I'm just going to lean into Vex and give her an Enhance Ability on her charisma.
Laura: Ooh! I'll take that.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: You get advantage--
Laura: On charisma checks?
Marisha: Yeah. On checks.
Laura: I like it.
Marisha: Her cleavage gets a little nicer.
Laura: It can't get any nicer than it already is.
Taliesin: Very fair.
Liam: All said out loud.
Taliesin: Pike, which one of those two is Vax's? Which one of those two belongs to Vax?
Ashley: This one.
Taliesin: Oh that one? I'm taking a sip of it.
Ashley: Take a sip. It's very thick.
Matt: It's very thick, and it's sweeter than you expected, but it has a definite burn that grows and grows after drinking it. It's syrupy, but because of its syrupy texture, as it goes down it also coats and numbs everything as it touches.
Liam: Percy, I saw that. You have to buy me a whole other drink.
Taliesin: That's fine. I put my whiskey in its place and take the whole cup.
Liam: No motherfucker, that's not what I said! I want to drink that one and the one after it! Oh, you don't want to start with me, Fredrickstein.
Travis: Are you sipping it?
Ashley: I'm sipping it. I'm doing as the locals do. Enjoying it how he told me.
Matt: And you get the sense it's probably a good thing.
Ashley: It burns!
Matt: It's almost like maple syrup Everclear.
Ashley: Ugh!
Laura: Gross!
Travis: How's my meat pie?
Matt: Meat pie's pretty good!
Travis: This is pretty good!
Laura: That makes me want an empanada right now.
Liam: Role-playing, guys.
Matt: Sadly, no empanadas in Deastok.
Sam: Why isn't he coming over here? Should we send another drink? Maybe two this time.
Laura: He's in the middle of a conversation right now.
Taliesin: He has to sit and enjoy his drink.
Laura: Let him take some time.
Ashley: (slurring words) Should we sent him a Change-Bringer's Nectar? Oh no!
Laura: Oh no, Pike!
Ashley: (still slurring) I only had like three drinks. Three sips.
Travis: Keep going.
Laura: Just tiny sips.
Ashley: They were so small.
Laura: Drink some, maybe some water, too, in between each sip.
Ashley: Okay. Maybe some meat pie.
Taliesin: That's whiskey. That's supposed to be-- never mind. Go ahead.
Marisha: Hey, who's the Change-Bringer? Does anyone know? I feel like this drink is inspired. Can I do a check to see?
Matt: Make a religion check.
Marisha: Aw, I'm not good at this. Pike, you know gods!
Ashley: Let me see if I know. Will I know the Change-Bringer?
Marisha: Oh, please. I have no idea. I definitely have zero idea.
Ashley: I'm going to see if I can think of it. 14.
Matt: It's really not that hard. The Change-Bringer is Avandra. Avandra, one of the gods of the pantheon.
Marisha: Oh. Yeah, of course we knew that.
Matt: The Change-Bringer is the deity that looks over luck, looks over adventure, travel, the open road. That's as much as you can glean from your passing knowledge of the deity. Since you are not a woman of faith, obviously, you don't know much beyond that.
Marisha: It just sounded fancy.
Ashley: It sounded so fancy.
Matt: She's also known as "she who makes the path."
Laura: Hey, Tary.
Sam: Yes? Is it time? Should I go over there?
Laura: Just calm down. This is mainly what I'm trying to tell you right now. Stop being so weird.
Ashley: Do you want a sip of Change-Bringer's Nectar?
Laura: It might actually help you just a little bit.
Taliesin: Do what we do any time there's trouble. Sit down, pay attention, and do everything she says.
Laura: And don't look sneaky.
Taliesin: Have a sip of this. It'll help.
Laura: Yeah, seriously. Just have a little sip. A little sip, it's always good to relax your nerves.
Sam: All right.
Ashley: Loosey-goosey.
Sam: I'll take my helm and cock it to the side.
Laura: Yeah, jauntily. That's good, yeah.
Taliesin: Okay, now I feel like I'm on a listing ship.
Travis: What's your confident face look like? More tongue. Little further. Yep. Little higher eyebrow on the right side.
Laura: Okay, maybe stop. I'm just afraid he's going to look over here at any moment. I'm keeping an eye on good old Korshad, and seeing if he looks over here. I also want to see if I can catch his lips and see what he's talking about over on the side there.
Liam: And I would like to look around the room and make sure that other people aren't watching us, or if so, where in the bar they are.
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: And I would like to make my way over to the goliath woman.
Matt: Okay. So as you begin walking in that direction, Vex. Couple things. One, you notice that Korshad, while he seems to be mostly being talked at or at least just listening to a conversation, when he does speak, he leans in and does this.
Laura: Of course he fucking does.
Matt: You get the sense he's a very guarded man and this is not his first rodeo. He speaks through his fingers.
Laura: I do, too!
Matt: But he doesn't appear to look over at your table again. He seems to have acknowledged the drink, is enjoying it slowly, and is back enthralled by the conversation at his table. What did you roll?
Liam: 25.
Matt: 25. And what did you say you were going to do?
Marisha: Mimic Vex.
Matt: Okay. You both cover your mouths.
Laura: What are you doing?
Marisha: I'm following your lead.
Laura: You don't have to do that.
Taliesin: Does this one still work? We can do this one.
Laura: Yeah, that one's good. Just this.
Ashley: Is this good?
Laura: That's it, Pike. Pike's got it. He's definitely going to come over and talk to us now, I can feel it. We're so cool.
Taliesin: This is a lot of drink that I seem to have taken on.
Matt: Vax. Glancing about the chamber, remember I said there was a secondary platform, that didn't have any doorways to rooms, but there was just the upper walkway across the room both ways? There are about six figures on each one.
Liam: Six on each one?
Matt: They're all sitting there, wearing leather armor, mostly covered by a cloak. You glance up and you can see underneath at least two of the cloaks what appear to be the shape or outline of a crossbow at the ready.
Taliesin: 12 of them? 12 men?
Liam: I relay to the group quietly, yes. Packing. 12 or so above us all, so no sudden movements.
Matt: The music picks up again, Grog, as you're walking over. The next piece is occurring and you can see now that while the previous one had a frenetic tribal beat, this one has more of a scattered, if I could say percussion jazz sense. It tends to have multiple changes. Yeah, if you could. If you haven't heard the jazz timpani before, it's fantastic. It's more of an improvisational piece. You can see where they're each building off of each other, and then one will make a change and the others will shift with it. You don't notice this, because you really don't care, but anybody who had musical interests would be able to pick up on this. But you walk up and you see the goliath woman. Most of the goliath women you've come across, their lifestyle leads to either very short-kept or very tightly bound hair, as the coarse hair of the goliaths tends to mat up very thickly when living in the wild as your tribe did. This goliath female's hair is really well kept, actually. It's almost shining, which catches you off guard entirely. She's not tattooed and appears to be in a trance as she's in the process of drumming away, not even looking at the two of her compatriots or any patron. She's spacing out and is currently enraptured by the music she's creating.
Travis: Are there any weapons around her feet or where she's sitting or playing?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Travis: Three.
Matt: She has very nice boots. And as a man who has made boots in the past, you can acknowledge, those are very well-made boots.
Travis: Me Grog!
Liam: I just love the alacrity that Travis goes to two, three. It's so good.
Travis: You play good!
Matt: The head slowly turns and the eyes focus for a second in the dim, snow-blind looking pupils, and gives you a nod.
Travis: Nice hair.
Matt: Head turns a little to the side.
Travis: I'll be-- if you--
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots, Grog.
Travis: What?
Ashley: Tell her she has nice boots.
Travis: Nice boobs!
Matt: (bang) Big drum hit, and her part of the song comes to a halt. The two other bits of music alter but continue the beats, and she just--
Travis: Boots. Nice boots. Bidet. And I go back to the group.
Matt: As you walk back to the group, a little dejected, Vax, since you're the one who's paying attention the most at this point, you notice as the goliath gets this small grin on the side of her face and continues to go back to the drums.
Laura: You charmed her!
Marisha: Look at you!
Liam: Nice work, de Bergerac!
Matt: But Grog doesn't see it.
Ashley: I'll be your Cyrano!
Matt: All right. So what's the next order of business, guys?
Taliesin: Is that conversation breaking up?
Laura: That's what I planned on doing, is waiting out that conversation. I in no way want to interrupt it.
Matt: About 20 additional minutes go by. Another round is bought at the table, with Korshad still slowly, very carefully sipping the drink that you guys bought for him. Doesn't appear to be slowing, doesn't appear to be breaking. You can keep waiting if you want.
Laura: I want to get one of those fancy drinks for myself and see what it is.
Sam: You mean the Korshad drink?
Laura: I want one of the Korshad drinks.
Matt: One of the Korshad drinks, okay.
Taliesin: I would assume you've already had this stuff at this point. We've been sharing a cup around. This is too much for a human being to handle.
Matt: Do you go to the bar?
Laura: I'll go up to the bar. We don't know his name, do we? The bartender's name?
Matt: You haven't asked him yet, no. There are a few barhands that walk around, but the one you've been going with, you can go ahead and catch his eye as you go through the area. "Hey, do you need something?"
Laura: Of course, darling. I didn't catch your name.
Matt: "Oh! Wence."
Laura: Wence, thank you so much. Could I grab another of those fabulous five-gold drinks there, that you brought to our friend?
Matt: "Oh, you want Schlond's Embrace. Okay. If you're sure about that."
Laura: I don't know, what is it?
Matt: "It's an acquired taste. It's made from a very long-distilled, 40-year processing of a heavy mint leaf, and that, when it's been very thickly fermented, is mixed in with this very sour port base that's been repeatedly funneled and sifted until it's become almost thick in its own right. That's mixed together with a few other sugars and a bit of a special fruit. Honestly, I think it tastes pretty shitty, but it's what he likes."
Laura: I'm going to give it a go.
Matt: "All right then! Five gold." He goes and makes the drink for you again.
Laura: Slowly but surely marking little amounts off this party fund, y'all.
Marisha: Need to make some more money.
Matt: However, he does not bring it in the same glass. He brings it in a regular glass. You get the sense that the glass that was filled was his own. But it's delivered and it's different. It almost has a weird, mushroomy flavor to it. The fermentations involved in the processing of this is not the type of alcohol you'd expect. It's a little musty. But it's functional, and it has an aftertaste that comes to a very strong mint, like a wintergreen afterwards. It's a very strange mixture.
Laura: It's like brushing your teeth, only you get drunk.
Matt: Yeah, kind of. In fact, elements of it taste like having orange juice after brushing your teeth.
Laura: Foul.
Matt: Yeah. It's a little rough at times.
Marisha: What are you learning about the man by what he drinks?
Laura: I'm learning that he probably has minty fresh breath.
Marisha: Oh, really?
Ashley: Maybe you should cheers him from afar so he can see you're drinking it.
Laura: Yeah, but mine's in an ugly cup.
Marisha: They didn't give you the same cup?
Travis: I have nice cups. Do you want a jewel-encrusted chalice?
Laura: Do you have one?
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: Pull it out.
Travis: I'm like fucking Bed, Bath, and Beyond in this bitch. Jewel-encrusted chalice.
Laura: Do you really have a jewel-encrusted-- you do, in your fucking Bag of Holding?
Travis: Not anymore, it's getting marked off now.
Laura: Sweet. I'm going to clean that shit out, pour it in.
Taliesin: The interior of that bag looks like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. It's a little weird in there.
Matt: It is a silver and pewter chalice that contains a number of multi-colored gems embedded along the sides, going to the base.
Laura: This is gorgeous.
Matt: Lil' Jon would be proud. It's beautiful.
Laura: Taryon. You drink out of this one.
Sam: That drink?
Laura: Yeah, you're the one that bought him the drink. Look like you're drinking it, too.
Sam: All right. Pinky out.
Laura: How is it? Do you like it?
Sam: I love it. (whispers) It's terrible.
Laura: I know.
Sam: I'll just laugh, way too loud. (laughs) And then she said to me, that's not armor!
Matt: Another 20 or so minutes pass in the tavern.
Matt: Some folks have entered since then, some have left. The patrons that are here don't seem to be-- there isn't a lot of switching in and out. Seems like most of the folks here come here fairly often at the end of the day, whether to go about their business or to unwind. But no one seems to be approaching you, no one's crossing your path.
Marisha: I'm so bored.
Laura: Can I go over and talk to Wence one more time?
Matt: Sure. You catch his attention. He comes back to the table as you step up and start in his direction, he goes, "Hey. Another round, eh?"
Laura: Actually, no. I give him five gold.
Matt: "All right. You want another one?"
Laura: No, I'd rather not. No, I was just wondering, do you know how long Korshad usually hangs out here every night?
Matt: "Varies. Easily probably another hour or so."
Laura: Always with the same company, or different people?
Matt: "Varies. They've been here most of the afternoon."
Laura: Oh, wow. Would you mind going over to him and just letting him know that the gentleman who bought him the drink would love a moment of his time.
Matt: "Oh, all right."
Laura: Taryon Darrington. He needs to know the name.
Matt: "Okay. I will." He looks at the gold and goes, "All right. I will."
Laura: No rush. But make sure it happens.
Matt: You see he noticeably gets a little nervous. Walks over. Do you go back to your table to join your compatriots? Okay. As you're watching, he actually has to psych himself up. He approaches and then turns around and stops for a second, and goes up to the table again and stops himself and gets the gumption up this time and goes to the table. And you see him talking to Korshad, who at this point has his hand on the tip of the drink, glances up at him. Looks over at the table again.
Laura: I walk over and put my hand on Taryon's shoulder and keep eye-contact with Korshad.
Matt: You see a smile creep slowly across Korshad's face. Puts his hand up and immediately you can watch as Wence, who's in the middle of talking and expressing this goes, "Yes." And quickly darts away. Korshad gives a point to the rest of the guys and you watch his lips say, "Excuse me a moment." He stands up.
Sam: Make some room. Grog, leave!
Marisha: I scoot with Grog.
Travis: We get up. I get up.
Marisha: I get up with Grog, too. Oh, I have to pee. Do you want to go pee?
Matt: As Korshad's walking across the room, Vax, you do watch as all the individuals that are on the upper platform all watch him go through the room and are now seeing the table and where they are standing. The attention is very strongly on what is about to transpire.
Liam: So far just eyes, though?
Marisha: Yeah, I start paying attention to the room as well, with Grog.
Liam: Grand Poobah, here.
Laura: You said that over the earring?
Liam: That was Liam.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: Korshad walks his way over to the table and you can see, as he walks through, occasionally somebody at a nearby table will stop and watch him him. Very quickly to you, you get the sense that he's definitely one of the more powerful figures that seems to come in and out of this establishment. He approaches the edge of the table, still holding the cup from the upper lip. There's like a lip at the very edge that he keeps clasped with his fingers as it drifts there in front of him, and he occasionally sips from it that way as he walks towards you. Comes up to the edge of the table. "Do you mind if I sit here?"
Laura: Oh please, join us.
Matt: He sits down and places the cup on the table. (muffled) "So." (laughter)
Matt: "My man Wence tells me that you are requesting my presence."
Laura: Yes. For the sake of this. I'm going to move my hands but just know my hands are here the whole time. Okay?
Matt: Okay. (laughter)
Laura: I'm sure you're familiar with Taryon here.
Sam: Taryon Darrington, of the Darrington family.
Matt: I have not had the pleasure, but I know of you.
Laura: And you are familiar with his father as well?
Matt: "Quite."
Laura: We've heard tell of recent situations with his family and you.
Matt: "And?"
Laura: And we were hoping we could come to an agreement.
Matt: "What agreement do you have proposed?"
Laura: Well, I don't know if you've heard of Vox Machina?
Matt: "We trade in a great many things. Information being one. And I am well aware of who you are."
Laura: And I'm well aware that someone like you could find a good use for someone like us.
Matt: "Are you offering your services?"
Laura: Potentially. If it could help clear the Darrington name.
Matt: (sighs) "You are not wrong. I, myself, am the keeper of the deeds. I consider the Darrington estate a long-growing loan that is now ripening. You see, our community here thrives on a principle that other syndicates in Exandria lack. Patience. I have been letting this stew for a very, very long time, so if you wish to make any sort of dent in this debt, your task will have to be equally monumental."
Sam: Well, I can make magical items, if there's something that you need made or enchanted. We have other members of the group that do different things. We have a fine tinkerer, if you need something made for you. Vex here is an excellent shot. She could put on an archery show or something, if that would be something worthwhile to you. You know, if that will help ease the debt. I know my family owes you quite a bit of money.
Laura: 230,000 gold. If we're hearing correctly.
Matt: "You are correct. For the time being."
Sam: And might I inquire, as it is my family's debt: what is the timetable on that? Will you be coming to collect anytime soon?
Matt: "I have given your father a date of six months to pay this debt. If it is not paid, then the deeds, as agreed upon many years ago, transition to my name entirely. I am not going to kick your family to the street; I am not a terrible man. But I will be possessing all of your belongings."
Sam: Will they be in any physical danger?
Matt: "No. Not unless they put up a fight."
Sam: Well, I don't know much about you, but I assume you would much rather have the cash than have to own property and manage it.
Matt: "Both have their uses."
Sam: All right.
Laura: So would the Darringtons simply work for you?
Matt: "The family, I will happily give them time to find whatever place they can afford to live or leave the city entirely. It is not my business. However, I will be taking over the farms, I will be taking over the business, I will be taking over the estate. Most of the assets within, they will become property of the Myriad."
Taliesin: Well, there. That's where I think we could come to an arrangement. We're not particularly invested in the power structure here. We're here for sentimental reasons. The estate and just enough property to maintain a modest comfortability. We don't really care what happens to the fortune so long as your family's taken care of.
Sam: Yes, I guess.
Taliesin: You keep your house, you keep your things, you keep a little bit of property to manage.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: What do you think? I mean, they did make this bed. I'm suggesting to you that maybe it is not your job to save your family's power and allow them to keep going as the way they have. But just to give them enough that even if they-- that they can continue with reasonable means. Maybe not necessarily living the life that they were living before but living far more comfortably.
Sam: Even that would be a step up, but it seems like we would have to do something in order just to earn that much.
Taliesin: Oh, I imagine so. It's just, there's a difference between saving everything and saving enough to keep them comfortable.
Matt: "If I am to understand you correctly, you are willing to offer your service to us?"
Taliesin: Possibly.
Matt: "And in exchange, we would still be taking the land-based assets from the Darrington name, other than the estate and enough means to live comfortably."
Taliesin: And enough income property for them to be relatively comfortable. Reasonably comfortable. I'm sure we can take a look at the assets and come to a very, very reasonable arrangement. And you, in turn-- well, we could have a discussion about what that would be worth to you. I have no interest in making an arrangement that doesn't please you. We're only here, again, for sentimental reasons. We are not invested beyond that.
Matt: Make a persuasion check.
Taliesin: Please, god. You've been terrible today. 15.
Matt: He goes, "Comfortable living is a relative thing. To maintain my comfort of living, well, your estate is but a drop in the bucket. But, and I mean no offense--" as he looks about the rest of you-- "Comfortable living for some of you, well, that could be as much as my drink would cost."
Sam: My family would require their main property and all residential rental property.
Matt: "That is not a deal. The residential and the farm territory is to become mine. I would leave for them your estate and enough gold to live a comparably comfortable lifestyle than living on the street for years to come. They could then strike out on their own, start a new fortune if they wish. Perhaps land barony was not their strong suit. You seem to have found other pursuits, maybe you could lead them in a new path."
Laura: And past that point, they would be in no debt to you?
Matt: "Past that point, and a task done in our favor by the famed Vox Machina. Maybe."
Sam: Would they get to maintain possession of their personal property? Artwork, statues?
Matt: "Everything that remains within the estate home itself would be yours to keep. The rest is mine."
Sam: And what is this task?
Matt: "Roughly 120 miles east of here lies a sinkhole. It has swallowed the core of the platinum mines of Herethis a few months back. Now, those mines are a very lucrative point of business for my employers. And every time we've sent scouts to inspect the source of this erosion, none have returned. Many very capable and proven men, unheard again. One of our greatest diviners has since spoken of a powerful force within this mine. Ancient. Birthed improperly. But now seems to grow more and more mad. We're at a loss, so we've put out a contract or two, but nothing has taken a bite yet. If you were to go to this mine, find this entity that has ruined our mining operation there, return with proof of its demise, and we confirm its destruction, I will consider our task complete."
Taliesin: We'll also need some operating capital for this. It sounds dangerous, so we will take the job, but we will need to also charge a very reasonable fee, I think, on top of this.
Matt: "That is entirely understood. And we will keep track of each fee, and we will deduct it from the materials in the Darrington estate."
Laura: If we take care of this for you, it does seem like a monumental task.
Matt: "It may not be. But it would seem to be something of your skill set."
Laura: From what we've learned, ancient beings tend to be quite powerful. We would ask that you don't slander the Darrington name. That when they stay in their estate, everyone believes they are still the Darringtons as they have always been.
Matt: "I would agree to that. I have no interests in your family's public image. I believe that damage has been done well enough on your own."
Sam: Yes. Are you sure you don't have a cloak I could just enchant and then we could call it square?
Matt: (chuckling) He takes another sip from his drink. "When all this is said and done, Taryon, we'll be in contact. I think there is much business we could do in the future."
Sam: All right. I suppose we have no choice.
Taliesin: We do.
Laura: There's always a choice, dear.
Marisha: You could marry the girl or we could go kill an ancient being.
Taliesin: I'm feeling pretty good about this one.
Marisha: Yeah!
Sam: All right.
Laura: Do we need to decide at this moment?
Sam: Seems like we do.
Taliesin: We will also need all of the information you have on this creature in the mines, and if you have anybody who has access to that--
Laura: The diviner would be wonderful to speak to.
Matt: "The information I have given you is what the diviner has found."
Sam: I'm not going to ask you all to risk your lives for my shitty family, so I will pursue this matter on my own if I have to.
Laura: Good. Yeah. You're going to go by yourself.
Sam: Well, I would hire a couple of people to come with me, but if you'd like to accompany me, I'd be okay with that too.
Travis: We could watch you do it. That'd be pretty funny.
Sam: Well, I mean, you've taught me a lot, so maybe I could do it.
Laura: I think you're good.
Ashley: You won't find anybody as good as us.
Sam: Of course not.
Marisha: You are very skilled in hiring talented mercenaries. That might be your strongest suit.
Sam: I am one for two on that count.
Taliesin: And we do have another mercenary at our beck, if we need. That's actually very fair. You're already one up.
Sam: Should we vote on it then? Grog, do you want to go kill something big and scary?
Travis: Yes.
Sam: Pike, are you drunk?
Ashley: I think you should marry whoever you want. So that's what I think we should do. Yes. Yea. I vote yea.
Sam: Twinsies?
Laura: Always have your back, dear.
Sam: Oh, Vax isn't here. Hey Vax. You want to go help me save my family by risking our lives in almost certain death?
Liam: What does that entail?
Sam: I'll take that as a yes. Keyleth?
Marisha: Vax says yes, and so do I! Aye!
Sam: Science bro?
Taliesin: Vex says yes, and I am so in the mood to kill something. (laughter)
Marisha: I think we've all risked our lives for each other at one point and another, so it's your turn, Tary. Welcome to the family.
Taliesin: Cheers. This stuff burns.
Matt: And this whole conversation he's had his mouth covered, he takes his fingers away from his mouth and he takes the drink. "Do we have an accord?" Picks his drink up and clinks it. "Return when the deed is done." Slaps the table and stands up and walks back. And at this point, that you notice, the tables nearby, everyone's been just quietly watching in on this. As soon as he leaves they go back to their business and drinking.
Taliesin: Everyone, on the count of three, we're going to stand up very quickly.
Marisha: Okay.
Sam: Why? Okay.
Liam: Wait! No, I'm just fucking with you.
Laura: Three! Let's go!
Matt: As you do that, about half the folks get startled by it. The music's still going.
Laura: On the way out, can I grab Wence again, one last time?
Matt: "Hey."
Laura: Most of the people here, are they local patrons or do they come from all over?
Matt: "Most of them are local and come from all over."
Laura: Great. Thank you.
Matt: "Sorry."
Laura: It's all I needed.
Matt: "I just serve the drinks, miss."
Travis: Can I make my way back over to the players?
Matt: Okay. She's sitting there. (drumming)
Travis: Can I have your name?
Matt: (drumming)
Travis: (louder) Can I have your name?
Matt: As she's still drumming her head slowly turns around and she goes, "Camilla." (drumming)
Travis: Thank you, and I leave.
Matt: (laughs) All right. With that, we're going to take a break. Try and get back here in a minute guys, see this next bit of interesting fun.
Marisha: To Camilla!
Matt: All right guys, so we have tonight's Wyrmwood giveaway: this awesome butternut wood and leather dice tray. Giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood. Come on over, jump into the Twitch chat to enter for the possibility to win this, the word for the night is Myriad. That is M-Y-R-I-A-D. If you don't know, look it up on Google.
Marisha: You'll win it if you spell it right.
Matt: Exactly. Butternut up or shut up with your Myriad spelling. All right guys, be back here in a few minutes. See you in a second. [break]
Matt: Hello, everyone. Welcome back to Critical Role. Which, timing works out interesting sometimes. Yeah, welcome back to the game. We had our break. Going to go ahead and jump in here.
Liam: I feel cheated. I didn't hear any of that.
Sam: (belches)
Laura: Nice.
Sam: Thanks.
Matt: As you guys have found your way out of what seems to be this strange subterranean bar beneath the Grumpy Lily, you've agreed to, at least for the time being, to make your way east to this mine, which currently seems to be under the-- what's it called? The Platinum Mines of Herethis. Herethis. Which you, Taryon, you understand. Herethis is a region, a regional forest area over there. The Herethis Wood. About 120 miles east. You guys decide: What's your best means of travel? How do you intend to get there?
Sam: We have to misty there, right? Because you don't know any trees in the area?
Marisha: I could scry on the area if I knew enough about it.
Taliesin: If we misty there we could also camp for the night.
Laura: Yeah, we need to camp because we need to rest and get our shit back.
Marisha: That's fine. It's 120 miles.
Matt: It's not terribly far, as the mist flies.
Marisha: Yep. I'm pretty fresh.
Taliesin: We can misty there, camp for the night.
Travis: (repeatedly, getting deeper) Yeah. (laughter)
Travis: Character voice.
Matt: Well, I'll go ahead and by the way, because I totally forgot. We do have a winner in the chatroom. Besolis8926, you won the giveaway.
Liam: You got the Nutter Butter box!
Matt: Yeah, Denova will contact you for your information to get it shipped to you, so congratulations. All right, so. What are you thinking about for travel? You're just doing the Wind Walk?
Marisha: All right, before we leave, is there any type of research we should potentially do?
Travis: Nope. Headlong. (laughter)
Sam: I don't know what we'd be researching. The guy who sent us on the mission doesn't even know what it is.
Liam: It's not even nearby, so it's not like we could ask people what the mine is like. It's 120 miles away.
Travis: Yep.
Liam: The mines of "hear this."
Laura: Herethis.
Travis: This is right up our alley. Like this is literally what we've been training for our whole lives.
Marisha: I mean, just in case there's maybe some ancient deity that rules over the forest of Herethis and some sort of goddess? Fuck it, let's go.
Laura: I mean, do we know anything? Have we ever heard about the woods of Herethis or the Platinum Mines of Herethis?
Matt: You guys haven't. You have. They're woods that lead into this small rocky-- it's almost too small to be a mountain range and more just large, rocky hills. But there's no historical significance to the location that you know of. Go ahead and make a history check.
Travis: Roll high.
Taliesin: That'll do.
Sam: Oh yeah! 21.
Matt: 21. You do know a number of the large-scale battles that took place towards the end of the Age of Arcanum took place on Wildmount. In fact, Zorhaus, the other kingdom that we were discussing before is largely a badlands, barren landscape because that was where the final battle between the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities took place. And the sheer volume of, the sheer intensity of that battle laid waste to the landscape there, so you have the Dwendalian Empire and the whole western side of Wildmount, which is fairly lush and functional, then towards the Zorhaus Kingdom is, and that whole eastern side of the continent, a lot of it is just barren, cracked, destroyed. But you do know that Herethis, the name, at least, stems from a hero that fell in a battle long ago. You can't recall the specific details of it, but there is some significance to the title or at least the location there to something ancient and old. May have to deal with this time period of entities battling gods. That's the best you can make out. The mines are well known. The Platinum Mines are well known. They're not well attended. They're not a public space, and they're definitely under the control of a number of companies that are shadow corporations under the control of the Myriad. You can see where the connection and the necessity for it to be reopened again is important. Platinum is not a very common metal.
Travis: Anything we should be worried about?
Sam: Gods attacking us.
Travis: Nope.
Marisha: Trial run.
Laura: Oh man. No, but really, that's where the battles took place, huh? So this ancient being could be from, potentially--
Sam: Or it could not.
Taliesin: Whatever it is, it's not leaving the mine.
Liam: We're running off on a lark, but we've raked ourselves in the faces before.
Laura: Yeah! If we die, we die.
Sam: Oh god, I don't want to die.
Taliesin: Well, no one wants to die.
Marisha: Well, once again--
Laura: Don't say it, Keyleth. Do not fucking say it.
Travis: Don't incant that shit again.
Laura: Don't say it about all of us and doom us to your fate.
Travis: Goldfish.
Marisha: Duty. (laughter)
Travis: Better.
Sam: Before we go, was there something you wanted to tell the drow woman?
Laura: Oh shit.
Liam: If we're talking about what we were talking about before, I don't think it's a good idea.
Travis: Why?
Liam: If you want to go and find him, us, and say hi, that's a different story.
Laura: I would like to point out that this same person you are so adamantly protecting from our scrying or our spying or our finding is the same person who shit in the middle of a temple so that he could watch Pike.
Liam: Well, A) he did that, not us, and B) we were all very much friends and happy with each other when he did that, and he is not happy with us. It's not exactly the same thing, dear. But if you want to go with me and find him and check in and say hello, I'd be very happy to do that with you. But to send the woman who threw our friend, drugged, over the back of a horse, and took him off to his family? I don't really want to send her after Scanlan, to look in on him or follow him or watch him or anything him. It didn't sound like his father wanted him dragged back on the back of a horse, and it happened anyway. She doesn't seem very trustworthy to me. Yeah, she's cool. So what?
Laura: I just realized I have the other half of the stone. The traveling stone.
Marisha: That we gave Scanlan.
Laura: I could pop in on him anytime I want.
Taliesin: Or he could pop in on you anytime.
Marisha: But he hasn't.
Travis: If he has it, still.
Marisha: Yeah, maybe he threw it into the ocean for all we know.
Travis: Ooh, that would suck because then we'd be in the ocean.
Laura: That would be really, really shit if he did that.
Marisha: It would be a massively dickish move.
Liam: That was very smart, Grog.
Travis: Hey.
Taliesin: Wow, that happened.
Travis: In your face.
Liam: Oh. Anyway, my point still stands. Once we wrap up here if you want to go find him I will go with you.
Marisha: And do what? Convince him to come back?
Liam: No.
Marisha: See if he's okay? Ask him how his year's been?
Liam: Yeah.
Travis: What about just a location and she has to stay unseen? You know, I know Keyleth can scry and stuff but--
Taliesin: We could make her walk first into the mines.
Marisha: Yeah, you didn't want me to even scry on him and now we're talking about just popping in on him? I feel like there's a weird crossing of the lines.
Travis: Yeah, but that was a year ago. I'm over that sentiment.
Marisha: Oh man, Grog.
Travis: Yeah. Yep.
Marisha: You guilted me very hard on that. You made me feel kind of shitty.
Travis: This is Grog evolved.
Marisha: No, you kind of got it right. Just go with it.
Taliesin: Exalted?
Laura: Exalted?
Travis: Absorbed. Yep.
Liam: You done been woked.
Travis: Woked.
Liam: So woked.
Laura: No, but seriously. What are we doing? I don't think we use that mercenary to walk into a mine. I'm not sending her to her death.
Taliesin: I am perfectly content to hold onto that chit for as long as we need.
Liam: Save that for a rainy day. We don't need to punch that ticket now.
Sam: Should we at least ask her to stay in town? For a to-be-determined mission later?
Travis: Well, I think she needs to keep up her employment, right?
Sam: We can give her a little money to keep around, a retainer.
Laura: No.
Sam: I can give her a little money. I might need her.
Taliesin: She was employed. She's reachable through employment. We can just find out how to reach her.
Travis: Oh, yeah, that one!
Sam: She might be gone.
Taliesin: You have to be able to hire her. I'm sure there's a system.
Sam: We have no idea how she was hired in the first place.
Laura: We go ask her how to hire her.
Sam: All right, well then let's do that.
Marisha: And no one has heard from him at all over the course of the year?
Travis: Who?
Laura: Oh. Well, he writes me all the time, but outside of that.
Travis: What? Really?! Scanlan does?!
Marisha: She's messing with you.
Travis: That was very mean.
Taliesin: You promised you'd keep that secret.
Liam: She has a mean streak.
Laura: (laughs) I have so many secrets to keep, dear. So many.
Travis: I'm mad for an (stutters) a long time.
Liam: I know one of them. When she farts it sounds like a duck.
Laura: It really does.
Marisha: That's kind of cute.
Laura: We go find-- (laughs)
Taliesin: You're going to fart awkwardly and we're going to yell "imposter!"
Matt: All right, so you find K'rynn. She let you know that she was just around the corner from where the estate was and let you know where to find her, and it's like an open tent/lounge area. She's just currently drinking water and eating a little bit of dried meat, and as you approach, she stands up. She still has her illusion on. She still has her pale skin. You get the sense that drow in general are not-- they don't have the easiest time walking through large societal establishments. "You returned. So what did you need?"
Sam: We have no mission at this moment, but we may call on you shortly after we return.
Matt: "Very well."
Sam: Can we find you here or will you be gone?
Matt: "I have no interest in staying in this city in particular. I generally prefer to stay around Vashlow."
Sam: Where's that?
Matt: "Vashlow? It's to the west of here. About 25 miles southeast of Port Demali."
Travis: Port Demali.
Matt: "If you wish to contact me, you can send a missive to Vashlow, or if you have access to a practitioner of the arcane arts, perhaps a Sending would be sufficient."
Sam: Sending, okay.
Laura: Definitely.
Sam: All right. Well, stand by. We'll call you. Thank you for your time, and we'll be in touch.
Matt: "Very well. It was just business."
Sam: Sorry about your horse.
Matt: "Eh. Fair trade." She gets up and gathers her little satchel over the side of her shoulder. "Until we meet again." She nods and then walks out into the darkness of the night.
Laura: Never to be heard from again because we'll forget that we have that connection. (laughter)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Let's Misty Step. Let's Wind Walk.
Laura: Misty Step tonight and then that way we can recover everything?
Taliesin: In the morning.
Marisha: Yeah, what time is it?
Matt: You're in the evening now.
Laura: Let's Misty Step there--
Matt: Misty Step is a very different spell.
Laura: Oh, sorry.
Liam: We go 30 feet. (laughter)
Sam: We're going to be windtalkers.
Matt: Yes. All right, so you guys go ahead and transform into your misty forms via the Wind Walk spell and begin making your way to the east, towards the Herethis Wood. Travel is pretty rapid. It's a clear sky. The moon's still pretty-- it's only been a few days since the last full moon when you guys had the ritual up at the top of the mountains with the Trickfoots, so it's very easy to see the details, especially those of keen vision. Rather rapidly, you find yourselves to the outskirts of the Herethis Forest, and after doing a couple passes overhead, you can see there is a portion of the forest that is open, and there you can see there are a couple of stone towers set up. There appear to be large ropes and cables fastened at the edges of what looks to be a large circular ravine, some sort of an entry port, a very large hole in the ground. And as you approach and get close you can see that, while there are two standing towers, there appear to be remnants of two other towers that have fallen in, and looking at some of the cables and the way that some of the equipment is set up, it appears that this sinkhole that he spoke of that consumed a portion of this entryway, whether it be a quake or something, a lot of the structure that was placed around the outside of the mine has fallen in, and is precariously being held either dangling over the inside by cable work or has crumpled somewhere at the bottom of this abyssal hole you see before you.
Marisha: What do you mean by--
Matt: When I say abyssal hole, that's just a descriptive way of saying it is pitch black from this distance. You cannot see anything past the top.
Sam: And it's connected to the Abyssal Plane.
Matt: It is actually a doorway to the Abyss. Hey guys! Orcus tonight!
Marisha: Finale!
Travis: Do we have any glow sticks that we could throw in and watch fall?
Taliesin: Yes, we actually do.
Matt: Have you guys transitioned back to your physical forms to have this conversation?
Marisha: Yeah. Well, we can float down.
Taliesin: If we're doing our little circle, I would say that a little bit of a distance.
Laura: Yeah, I don't want to camp right next to the--
Taliesin: About half a mile away.
Liam: I'm looking for cooties around the outside.
Matt: Okay, make a perception check.
Liam: Cooties.
Laura: Did you get it?
Ashley: No, it's right here.
Liam: Dang it. 24.
Matt: 24. Okay, you start coasting over the edge, and you can see there are broken carts and crates. You can see the remains of what seem to be a couple of humanoid bodies, mostly picked away to the point where there's just slightly pinkish bone from whatever dried bits of muscle or blood that remain, the rest of the flesh and organs pulled from or dissolved. You're not sure.
Laura: I think a Cure Wounds, a light Cure Wounds would probably help.
Sam: Dead talk?
Taliesin: They don't talk back, but yeah.
Sam: Let's do that.
Travis: Oh yeah, you can do that!
Ashley: We can talk to the dead. I have it.
Laura: We'll land a little bit away.
Travis: We didn't land yet, right?
Laura: Let's land a little bit away.
Liam: Getting some Baldur's Gate vibes here, man.
Matt: So you land about half a mile out, and you guys transition back to your physical forms. Vax shares the information and what he spotted.
Laura: Were the bodies on top or were the bodies down below?
Liam: On the edges, right?
Matt: They were on the edges.
Marisha: And when you mean seared, like acid? Or like heat?
Matt: Like white and pink bone. Like just whatever flesh was on there has been picked off.
Ashley: Like something was eating them?
Taliesin: Can we speak to dead?
Laura: Pike can do that.
Taliesin: Why don't you two misty there, somebody start setting up camp for tonight.
Laura: I'll go with Pike and we can stealth in.
Marisha: I'll start setting up camp.
Taliesin: You can still misty. We're still misty-able. You can fly in, talk to them, and fly back out.
Laura: She can't talk to them as mist.
Taliesin: I mean, land and then--
Laura: Oh, okay. I'll cast Pass Without a Trace, anyways, so we'll be stealthy going in. So I do that.
Matt: All right, so. Is it just you, Pike? Who's going with you?
Laura: And me.
Liam: I'm already standing by the bodies, yeah.
Matt: All right, so you go back to the bodies with them?
Laura: Okay, you're still out there?
Liam: No, I--
Matt: All right, so the three of you are turning back to mist and making your way back toward the entrance.
Taliesin: I'm going to set up the tents.
Matt: Okay. You guys land near the edge of this crumpled rock and you see where the ground itself has curled in and collapsed inward, and there are a number of cables or ropes that go across and various large structures, the stone towers that sit at the edge of this opening. You can see there's tension on these ropes and either the rope's going to snap at some point as the weather gets harsher over here, or the rock is going to crumble in if the ground keeps eroding. You're not sure if it's done, or if it's a slow crawling thing. There before you, you see a body. You can see elements of clothing, torn and dried, crusted with old blood. You see a boot that's left off to the side. The foot's been removed, but it looks like the edge of it's been torn and ripped a bit. The skeleton's been picked clean.
Ashley: Okay. We only see the one body?
Matt: There are three bodies around the whole exterior, but you've landed next to one.
Liam: When you said picked clean, do they look like they've been chewed upon?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Liam: It's fine. 18.
Matt: Looking at the bones, you can see signs of what appear to be scratches or grooves across the bones... It's interesting. A lot of the bones have a very smooth texture to them. You're used to seeing very porous, but it looks like elements of the bones have melted slightly.
Laura: Oh, gods.
Liam: Slimes, jellies. All right.
Laura: I'm going to get my broom ready. And while Pike is doing her ritual I'm just going to keep a hand on her, that if anything happens then I can just take off with her in tow.
Matt: Okay. Pike, you're casting Speak with Dead?
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: All right. It's easy enough for you to cast it. It's quick. Ritual complete, you go ahead and you burn some incense.
Ashley: Okay, I get three questions.
Matt: And at which point, the skeleton, which is face down on the ground by the way, the skull (bone creaking) creaks up and looks over. Like, turns around and faces you as it reaches. It curls upward, almost in like an upward dog--
Laura: Like downward dog? Oh. What's that called?
Matt: Cobra position, but the head's turned completely around and curled up.
Liam: Oh, I get down close to it and go (groans) and I flip it over.
Matt: (rattling thud) It flips over on its back and the head (bone creaking) turns back around to its right.
Liam: Sorry.
Matt: You get five questions.
Ashley: Five questions.
Marisha: Five?
Ashley: Good day, sir. It's not a good day for you. Sorry.
Travis: Wow.
Laura: It's okay. Good start.
Ashley: What happened to you?
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Something in the mines we found. It hatched. Or woke. And its anger shook the halls. I tried to run, but the skittering beasts got me first."
Laura: Skittering beasts?
Travis: Godzilla.
Liam: That's more than one.
Laura: (whispering) What did the skitterers look like?
Ashley: What did the skittering beasts look like?
Laura: Oh, in my drink?
Liam: It flew away.
Marisha: Yeah, it's a dick.
Matt: (raspy, strained) "Large. Hard carapaces. Pincers. Many legs."
Ashley: (whispering) It's like spiders.
Travis: Umber hulk?
Liam: Umber hulk with many legs.
Marisha: That could be a glabrezu, which fucking killed you the first time. They have pincers.
Laura: Yeah, but that's really big.
Marisha: I don't know. Skittering beasts?
Ashley: Is there anyone else alive?
Liam: Did anything work against it?
Ashley: Oh, yeah that's a good question. (louder) Was there anything that you guys could tell of your knowledge-- did anything seem to damage it or work against it?
Matt: (grunts) He seems confused about what you're referring to. The skittering creature or the--
Ashley: Oh. The skittering creature or the big thing?
Laura: The skittering creatures?
Ashley: Both, because we still have--
Liam: Against them
Ashley: Against them! Against the skittering creatures
Matt: "The skittering creatures, we just ran. I didn't look to see."
Laura: That's already three questions.
Ashley: Okay. Oh god, this is not-- (whispering)
Ashley: How big were the creatures?
Matt: "They were rather large, maybe eight foot end to end. They burrow, they spit. But they were awoken by the smaller one."
Ashley: Wait, he said they spit?
Laura: I didn't hear, something about his spit. What did he say?
Matt: You gather, what he said was-- (laughing)
Matt: No, the skitterers bite, they spit. But they were awakened by the smaller one.
Marisha: The smaller one?
Laura: What's the smaller one?!
Liam: What can you tell us of the smaller one?
Sam: They spit. Maybe acid, probably.
Liam: Yeah, they're smooth, that means they were just like (slurping noises).
Ashley: Is there anything that you can tell us about the smaller one?
Matt: "It was like a baby, and it cried out and everything fell around us. I barely made it out, but the skitterers found me." (deep exhale) The enchantment leaves that embodied the skull, falls to rest, the bones now motionless.
Sam: So it can emit a cry that shakes everything.
Ashley: A baby, like a baby?
Liam: Mandrake?
Matt: I would say, Marisha--
Marisha: Does it sound like anything we have encountered? A nature check?
Matt: We'll say a nature check for both you and Vex.
Marisha: Would I have an advantage with my little book?
Matt: Not for this in particular.
Liam: It will be like the creature back in Stillben?
Laura: Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Liam: And we have heard tales of mandrakes, and they scream.
Laura: Yeah, did the pincers sound like something we have fought though, before?
Matt: No, it's not something you've encountered before, necessarily.
Marisha: 19?
Matt: 19, okay. And Vex?
Laura: Nature check?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: Do I get advantage because I'm standing in the woods? Six!
Taliesin: You know you're standing in the woods.
Matt: You have heard of a creature that does exist in subterranean and sometimes forested areas, referred to as an ankheg.
Marisha: An ankheg?
Matt: An ankheg. They generally tend to snatch cattle and beasts of burden in the night. They are large and insect-like. They spit an acidic fluid. Some of the things this corpse has described makes you think of that.
Liam: Isn't that what our bug juice is made out of?
Matt: You bug juice is made of sandkheg, which is a desert-based variant of that creature.
Laura: Oh. I wonder if we could sprinkle it around us and they won't bother us because we'll smell like their brethren.
Travis: I ain't wasting that shit!
Laura: Hey, man, it's an idea.
Marisha: So they snatch cattle--
Sam: So we should all be cows.
Marisha: Oh my god, you guys. Perfect opportunity!
Liam: Throwback Thursday!
Marisha: Throwback Thursday!
Matt: If only the person who could cast the spell was in your party anymore. He's elsewhere in the world right now.
Liam: That asshole.
Sam: We just talked to him. He was the dead body. (groaning)
Matt: All right, so what are you guys doing?
Sam: Well, we're going to rest for the night, and then go in at first light.
Laura: Yes, we definitely should have a Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Yeah, let's have a Heroes' Feast, which-- okay, hang on, let me check here.
Travis: We don't need it.
Marisha: I can do a Heroes' Feast.
Taliesin: Protection from acid would probably be very--
Marisha: Okay, but my Wind Walk-- I already Wind Walked, so I can do a Heroes' Feast at a higher level. I also want to do a 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Matt: Okay. 5th-level Commune with Nature.
Marisha: What should I ask? What should I ask that we don't already know?
Sam: I mean, is there any nature down there? It's a mine. It's all rocks.
Marisha: Well, I can see in a two-, three-mile radius.
Travis: How deep does the hole go?
Marisha: I was thinking that.
Matt: Instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area: terrain; bodies of water; prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples; powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead; influence from other planes of existence; or buildings.
Marisha: Okay.
Matt: Choose three of those.
Marisha: First and foremost, influences from other planes of existence.
Matt: Okay, so as you focus and Commune with Nature, the plants speak to you in this series of images and thoughts that essentially get the idea across to you that there is something planar involved here, but it's very old and long-dormant, recently awoken.
Marisha: Okay. Planar, long dormant.
Taliesin: Recently awoken.
Travis: If it's a fucking baby ancient dragon I'm going to be stoked.
Marisha: Okay, so something planar.
Liam: Didn't Drez Vina send us to a fetal thing?
Marisha: Yeah, that was our first fight.
Sam: Oh, we can't do how deep is the mine? No?
Marisha: No, I can, it's a terrain question, so terrain. Yeah. How deep does this mine go?
Laura: Maybe you can ask where the thing is in the mine.
Marisha: Is. I think I can, right? Can I sense the location of where--?
Matt: You can ask whereabouts this thing is.
Marisha: Yeah.
Matt: Nature tells you this sinkhole goes down for about a quarter-mile, and it lies at the very bottom.
Laura: It's just straight down at the bottom of it?
Travis: That's 400 meters, y'all.
Ashley: So it's like this and then the little baby thing at the bottom?
Matt: Apparently, yeah. The whole ground just collapsed inward.
Marisha: 400 meters and the entity lies at the bottom.
Sam: We can just jump. We're like gods.
Marisha: Yeah, we're gods!
Taliesin: We're golden gods.
Marisha: It's only a little bit more than 1000 feet.
Laura: Yeah, then you might survive that one? Only if you turn into a goldfish and fall onto the ground. It's fine.
Marisha: Now I know Looney Tune physics doesn't work in this world.
Liam: Always go earth elemental.
Laura: Always Keyteor.
Marisha: Always Keyteor.
Sam: So what's our last question?
Travis: Something from another plane. We know it's 400 meters down.
Marisha: It lies at the bottom.
Taliesin: How many of these creatures are there?
Travis: Of the crawly ones?
Marisha: Ankhegs. Can I get a sense of how many and whereabouts the ankhegs are?
Matt: One of the two.
Laura: What are ankhegs? Are they fiends?
Liam: They're beasts, probably. They're big bugs.
Laura: Aberrations?
Marisha: How many?
Travis: Yeah, because if there's hundreds, then--
Marisha: That's a problem.
Taliesin: Then this is a stealth mission.
Matt: They are monstrosities, and that's what they look like right there.
All: Oh!
Taliesin: I love Starship Troopers. I'm excited.
Laura: We're about to fight some big, armored vaginas.
Marisha: About how many? Do I know about how many there are? Sensing their skittering movements under the surface.
Matt: Using the nature's essence to let you know somewhere in the neighborhood of about close to a hundred. Throughout the network of caves--
Marisha: Because this is a three-mile radius, right?
Matt: Yeah, so this is spread out amongst what would essentially be a subterranean anthill of these ankhegs.
Marisha: There's a lot.
Travis: We're going to need a fast exit. He wants us to take care of what the problem was.
Sam: We've just got to kill the big boss. One little baby big boss. The boss baby.
Laura: Did we understand correctly that it's the baby that cried out is the big monster? The big boss?
Matt: It seems to be the source of where all this started.
Laura: Okay. And that's the thing that woke up the skitterers?
Matt: Or at least brought them to start attacking the surface.
Laura: Okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like, there's a big boss and then there's skitterers and then there's also little babies that cry out.
Matt: You don't know. This is all the information you have.
Ashley: But do we know why the baby woke up? What woke the baby?
Laura: No, we don't know what woke up the baby.
Ashley: We didn't ask that? Okay.
Laura: Maybe we should talk to another dead person.
Travis: Nah.
Sam: I don't think they'll know.
Taliesin: I don't think they'll know.
Laura: They're not miners.
Ashley: They did something in the mine that awoke it. And we can redo it.
Taliesin: I think anybody who was there who saw it probably died at the center of it.
Liam: Sorry, we're trying to remember the very first game of D&D we ever played and Keyleth, twins, Grog were there.
Matt: Yeah, that's right. That was what was essentially a dead or stillborn deity. A demigod, essentially, in its own pocket plane.
Marisha: So does it have anything to do with this?
Matt: Roll a religion check.
Marisha: No. I'm bad at this! (groans)
Liam: I'm religious!
Matt: Yeah, if you want to, whoever's having this conversation you can make a religion check.
Liam: Luck of the day. Yes!
Laura: Natural 20.
Marisha: Are you serious?
Laura: No, I haven't rolled. I'm trying to make myself roll it.
Liam: I got a 19.
Laura: (gasps) Oh my god I rolled a natural 20!
Marisha: Shut up!
Travis: She really did.
Laura: It's like Run Lola, Run where she's doing the roulette thing and she's like--
Matt: Okay. You recall a while back that you battled with that entity, you-- what was it called? Crysa-Thul.
Laura: How?
Matt: (sighs) This is all I do with my free time, guys. Make up shit for fun. But that was not tiny. That was a very large entity. Like, to the point where you remember there was a 20-foot-wide well and a giant fleshy baby arm that slapped out and crawled it out Akira-style. Everyone kept saying small on this one, so you don't know if-- maybe related in some way? But you're not entirely certain. It doesn't appear to be the same kind of thing, necessarily. Not by the descriptor you've heard.
Liam: Corpse called it a small one, right?
Matt: It called it a small one.
Travis: We're good. We've still got to camp for the night, right?
Laura: Yeah. We're camping. But we should camp in the trees, y'all. Not in the ground, in case the things come up out.
Matt: Yeah, the thick forest of Herethis surrounds the mine.
Laura: Oh man.
Marisha: Can I Druidcraft some web hammocks?
Taliesin: I mean you can, I mean we've gone to all this trouble, but if we want to add to it. I mean, this is just what we've been doing.
Marisha: Look, I really like elaborate tree houses.
Taliesin: No, I understand. I respect the art form.
Marisha: I can have a rope bridge here.
Liam: Hammock bed.
Matt: We'll say Druidcraft, which is a very localized and cantrip-based magic, you could, over the next couple hours craft a single web hammock. (groaning)
Matt: It's a cantrip, yo!
Marisha: I'll pass. We'll just sleep with the ones we have or whatever
Liam: A third-grade diorama.
Matt: Yeah. This is what it would look like if you were to build to scale. Okay. So you guys find a place in the trees? Who's helming finding that spot? All right. Go ahead and roll an investigation check.
Laura: 15?
Matt: Okay.
Laura: Oh wait! I honestly don't know anymore what my favored terrain does for me.
Matt: No, this is exactly where to use it because forest is your favored terrain. This is exactly the kind of thing it would help with.
Laura: I always feel like I'm bullshitting it now. What am I rolling? Investigation?
Matt: Yes.
Laura: 24.
Matt: 24. You find one massive tree. The trees here can get pretty big, and there's one thick tree that the branches are pretty easy to climb, and up top it branches out and all the various branches that make up the canopy. It's almost like this little bowl at the very top, just underneath where the heavy foliage descends, and it's a perfect place for you guys to make a camp higher up off the ground.
Laura: Hey, this is a place! Let's do it here!
Taliesin: I'll unload everything.
Matt: All right, you guys make camp. Who's making first watch?
Travis: Me!
Laura: All right.
Liam: Me, too.
Ashley: Oh! Heroes' Feast.
Laura: Heroes' Feast.
Marisha: Heroes' Feast.
Matt: All right. We'll say as a note, this the last of the chalices you have prepared. If you want to do any more Heroes' Feasts, you'll have to specifically go and purchase the chalices or go look for it in town.
Liam: Let's do it!
Marisha: Is this including or not including the chalice that Grog gave to Vex earlier to drink out of?
Matt: That chalice, while it looks quite delightful, is not worth a thousand gold pieces.
Taliesin: It's from Medieval Times.
Matt: (laughs) It's a little gaudy.
Marisha: It's got Michael's. Michael's crafts.
Matt: Yeah, every time you drink from it you get glitter on your hands and you're like, shit.
Marisha: How do you turn it off? Cover it in blankets.
Laura: Yay, Heroes' Feast.
Sam: We're immune to fear?
Matt: You're immune to fear, immune to poison, and--
Laura: Advantage on wisdom.
Matt: Marisha, you want to go ahead and roll the additional hit points for Heroes' Feast?
Marisha: Yeah 2d10, yeah?
Matt: 2d10, I believe.
Laura: We're losing our 17?
Liam: Lose our 17 from the speech?
Matt: You do.
Travis: That's why I didn't take them.
Marisha: (gasps) Ooh! Wait, yeah! Ooh, that's amazing! It's a nine and a ten!
Matt: So 19 additional hit points to all of you guys.
Laura: If you give us a speech, how long does that last?
Matt: Temporary hit points last until they go down or you take a long rest, I believe. Let me double check.
Marisha: But this is going to be a long rest?
Laura: Oh wait, but does that mean we lose our temporary hit points on the Heroes' Feast?
Matt: Well, no. They're different. The Heroes' Feast is in addition to your maximum hit points. Temporary hit points are different. Technically, those two stack. You're about to lose the temporary hit points.
Marisha: But then at the top of the morning, I can give us another speech.
Matt: Should you be so inclined, yeah.
Laura: Tight.
Marisha: Do I have to do it?
Travis: No, you don't. You don't.
Marisha: Fuck you, Travis. Fuck you.
Matt: You can give the essence of a speech.
Marisha: Right, I can do an interpretive dance.
Travis: That's better.
Taliesin: Only if you actually do the interpretive dance.
Ashley: Wait, 19 extra?
Laura: He's giving you a look.
Marisha: A laser light show. With fireflies. It's like in a Disney Imagineer show.
Matt: It's a speech.
Marisha: All right, well, it's a speech.
Matt: You can give the essence of it, but the idea here is just you honing your public speaking skills.
Laura: You're going to get better at it, Keyleth.
Liam: It's like public debate in high school.
Sam: Toastmasters.
Taliesin: I love Toastmasters.
Matt: Temporary hit points. They last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest. Yes, I was correct. Cool.
Marisha: So in the top of the morning.
Laura: Top o' the mornin'!
Marisha: Top o' the mornin'!
Matt: All right. We'll say for the purpose of brevity, because even at your guys' level if you did encounter anything in this forest that was indigenous, you'd splatter it in a round. But you don't have any issues. Nothing really sees you up in the branches. You occasionally get caught off guard by the sound of a nearby (hooting). It's an owl in the trees. But nothing seems to bother you during your evening slumber. You complete your long rest. You still maintain your benefits from the Heroes' Feast, and as morning comes, Keyleth gives a rousing speech.
Sam: Just give us a topic.
Matt: You can just describe the topics you talk about. You don't have to give the actual speech.
Marisha: That's great, because one can only bullshit so much in a four-hour fucking game. I talk about the smell of our breakfast. It's bacon in the morning. And taste and smell the fleshy essence of the pork.
Taliesin: Is bacon what we're fighting for?
Marisha: No, bacon is definitely worth fighting for. Bacon is worth fighting for, and when we kill that celestial baby we will have the godliest bacon one could ever imagine.
Sam: I do like bacon.
Taliesin: This is the most Burning Man thing that's ever happened on this show. I'm flashing back.
Matt: Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest.
Taliesin: Bacon. Speech.
Matt: All right, guys. There you go. Take your 17 temporary hit points.
Marisha: She's not a great talker and has never been one. Just want to point that out. You guys all know this.
Matt: No, it's just her level.
Laura: Just add that to the 19 then?
Matt: No, because the 17, once the 17 goes it's gone.
Laura: But the 19 we can heal to?
Matt: It's still your maximum. You can heal to it, yeah. That is the difference.
Taliesin: I always imagine occasionally Keyleth gives a speech that's like what's-his-name from Animal House.
Sam: Matthew, I'm going to prepare some spells that I'm going to inject into various coins.
Matt: Yes, what are you doing?
Sam: I'm going to drop another 300 gold and give Vex another Revivify.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: Grog, you're already a good jumper, right?
Travis: Yeah.
Sam: How far can you jump?
Travis: You gave me a Fly coin.
Sam: No, that's gone forever. That's gone. It doesn't last forever. It lasts a couple hours.
Travis: Well, that's bullshit. Yeah, I can jump 15 feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally. So not great. Like three squares.
Sam: I'll give you a Jump coin, so that will triple your jump.
Travis: Will you sing "Jump" from Van Halen?
Sam: Sure. When you do it. Let's see here. Who needs things?
Ashley: (singing) Jump! For my love.
Sam: Oh no, you guys all cast things now, right?
Taliesin: Not really, why?
Liam: T., give me something! Show me some magic. Give me a doodad.
Sam: Can you turn invisible?
Liam: I used to be able to, but I--
Sam: You gave away your ring.
Laura: Kerr bear. Oh no, it wasn't Kerr bear. It was Tova.
Sam: I'll give you a Blur coin.
Laura: Don't you already have that with your--
Liam: That cloak that I gave away?
Laura: Oh yeah, that one.
Marisha: That's the one that Kerr bear took.
Liam: That's right.
Laura: That's right.
Matt: Yeah. (laughs) The inventory of the items you've lost to guests.
Liam: Lost? Gave away.
Matt: Lost and gave away.
Sam: I'll give good old Percival a Cure Wounds coin.
Matt: What level?
Sam: Just one.
Matt: Level one. You got it.
Taliesin: Yeah. It will hopefully not come in handy.
Sam: And also I'm going to change my Robe of Many Things to my new Robe of Many Things.
Matt: Okay.
Sam: And that's it.
Taliesin: A Vest of Several Items now.
Matt: (laughs) The Kigurumi of Useful Trinkets.
Laura: Oh, hey. Well, no. Maybe would this be a bad idea? To shoot an Oracle Arrow down into the bottom?
Taliesin: I think that's been working out very well for us. It is pitch black down there, though, isn't it?
Laura: Well. We have this method that we used to do. Light the arrow on fire, and then send it down. So I can see by the light of the fire on it.
Liam: Would that make your actual eyeballs burn?
Laura: I don't think so.
Sam: Oh! And I'm going to do one more thing. I'm going to pull out a healing draught bottle, and give it to-- no, you can heal things.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm all right.
Sam: You don't need to heal.
Travis: Other people, I normally do.
Sam: I give it to Vax.
Travis: I turn into Nurse Betty almost in every fight. What are you talking about?
Taliesin: Yeah, that's actually true.
Laura: That's true, he does. He does heal people a lot.
Travis: But that's cool, you give it to somebody that, you know--
Liam: Well, he can give it to me. I've got 50 things I can do a turn. It was what kind of potion?
Sam: A healing draught. It's not a potion; it's a bottle of healing shit.
Liam: Oh shit.
Sam: It's 8d8.
Ashley: 8d8?!
Liam: 8d8?!
Liam: I will never give this up. Ever. Thank you. Thank you, Taryon.
Sam: Sure.
Taliesin: I think that that's a really good idea, shooting an arrow down there.
Liam: I'm going to set the Deathwalker's Ward to necrotic.
Marisha: I'll light my hands on fire so that Vex can light her arrows on fire.
Taliesin: So when we're ready we've got something to light the--
Laura: Wait, should I cast Pass Without a Trace on us? No, I'm going to do the Oracle Arrow first. Oh. What if we wake it up when I shoot it down and things come out?
Liam: Well, that is a very real possibility.
Taliesin: Well, then they'll be easier to kill up here than they will be down there.
Marisha: They'll be 400 meters down. I could theoretically drop some awesome Fireballs on their face, potentially.
Laura: I like this idea. I'm going to cast Pass Without a Trace on all of us, just to be safe. So we can stealth and be quiet. Yeah, but they'll just keep falling, won't they?
Marisha: I don't know.
Laura: How does that work?
Marisha: That's a weird magic question.
Taliesin: This is why magic freaks me out.
Matt: What's the question?
Marisha: If I drop a Fireball, how long it'll go--
Liam: Does gravity continue to carry it down?
Matt: Drop a what? A Fireball?
Taliesin: Fire a Fireball into the abyss. Will it just eventually stop?
Marisha: Will it keep going?
Matt: Well, a Fireball is a small bead of magic energy that has a range. So if it reaches the end of the range, it has no effect.
Taliesin: This is why magic's weird.
Marisha: But I could Keyteor to the bottom.
Matt: You could.
Travis: We're just spoiled for choice.
Matt: You take half bludgeoning damage when you impact.
Marisha: Yep, advantages to both.
Liam: Dropping a great height did not go well for you.
Travis: Keyleth, did you roll 17 or 19 on your--
Marisha: I rolled 19, but then you get an additional 17 because my weird speech about bacon.
Matt: Bacon points. 17 bacon points.
Laura: It will make the most glorious bacon!
Matt: To be fair, I've eaten some bacon in my time that's given me some temporary hit points. Just saying.
Marisha: Look, it was inspired, okay?
Matt: Oh, completely.
Marisha: I'm not wrong.
Liam: We will not go bacon-less into the night.
Marisha: Bacon has saved many a people.
Laura: All right. I'm setting my arrow on fire, and I'm shooting it down into the pit.
Matt: Okay. Oracle Arrow. You fire it. It's a big pit. The radius of a small flame on an arrow doesn't seem to light up the walls. It's not bright enough, so it just descends and descends, and the wood is catching and burning, and eventually it hits the stony, earthy floor at the bottom (arrow impact) and it clatters and breaks a little bit. It's burning pretty heavily, and you glance around the space inside and you can see what looks like some broken mining equipment on the ground, jutting out in places. You see what appears to be some sort of stony platform that is carved, but mildly forgotten or eroded steps, and the rest of the arrow burns up and you lose your vision.
Laura: That was helpful. Super helpful.
Taliesin: Worth it. It was worth it. It didn't cost us anything.
Laura: That's true. I didn't see the great baby beast down at the bottom.
Taliesin: And that's information we didn't have. And now we know. Great baby beast is not at the bottom--
Laura: Potentially. In that small circle.
Taliesin: It's not at the bottom of the topless pit.
Laura: Okay, so we could take the flying carpet down. A couple of people could fly. We can take the flying carpet down.
Taliesin: Two flyers, plus the carpet.
Travis: The circumference of this thing is massive. The diameter.
Matt: Well, the diameter of the actual hole is maybe about--
Travis: Football field?
Matt: Not quite that big. I'd say it's about 150, 200 feet across?
Travis: Stay away from the walls.
Laura: You think? The skitterers are going to come out of the walls?
Travis: Yeah, do not come anywhere near the walls.
Sam: When we descend, do we want light to be able to see? Or we don't want things to see us?
Liam: Good chance they can see in the dark.
Taliesin: Let's have the flashlights ready, but not activated.
Marisha: I mean, I have a few Daylight spells.
Laura: It may be good to blind them if they dwell under the surface.
Travis: You know, if we're not in a rush-- (deeper) if we're not in a rush, it might just be nice to send a little mini nuke down into the hole and see what comes out.
Taliesin: Did your voice just crack?
Travis: Yeah, no, it's like reverse puberty.
Taliesin: Becoming a man? Okay.
Marisha: I'm down with that mini nuke. It extends a lot of our magical ranges, unless I want to Keyteor down.
Taliesin: I think it's better, especially-- have we seen a tree that we can port to in case of an emergency? Or some sort of object that we can port to?
Marisha: There are definitely a lot of trees, yeah.
Taliesin: But there will not be a tree down there.
Laura: No.
Matt: No.
Taliesin: Do we have an escape route if we need it?
Laura: We have a flying carpet, two brooms, a set of wings. Up and out.
Taliesin: Well, all right.
Travis: Just a reminder that I can't ride the carpet.
Laura: Yes, you can.
Liam: It's a big one.
Travis: Is it? Is it bigger than the first one?
Taliesin: Yeah, it's bigger than the first one.
Travis: So I can get on there with everybody else?
Laura: The only people we need to get on it are Percy and Pike. Everybody else can fly. Unless Keyleth is out of--
Marisha: Well, I can Polymorph him.
Taliesin: How much weight can the carpet take?
Ashley: I mean, you could technically just go on it alone and I could--
Laura: Hop on the broom.
Liam: We are versatile as shit.
Ashley: Hop on Vax's back.
Matt: Okay, the flying carpet, the one that you have? 800 pound capacity.
Travis: Okay.
Sam: It's you, right?
Taliesin: You're 300 pounds, right?
Travis: No, I'm... it's arguable. I'm definitely over 300.
Taliesin: Okay, so three of us on that carpet  one big one, one little one, and a medium.
Matt: You can fit Grog and one other person.
Travis: He's a big bastard.
Sam: We can take someone on a broom.
Laura: Yeah.
Taliesin: I'll join you on the broom.
Laura: All right.
Matt: I think you could probably fit Grog, Percy, and Pike.
Taliesin: Yeah, okay then. That solves it.
Sam: Well, then let's descend slowly and quietly? Is that what we're doing?
Marisha: Hang on. Before we go, there's a few things I want to do. Let me double-check-- I don't want to be a dumbass.
Taliesin: No, this is very clever. I see what you're going for.
Marisha: Hang on. Wait. I might need the book. Okay, one of the things I want to do is I want to use my staff to create an air elemental? So I want to take a minute to use my Spire to conjure an air elemental.
Matt: Conjure an air elemental.
Sam: By the way, can I just remind everyone, this whole year I've had one half of a communications bracelet and someone's been watching us the whole time.
Travis: What?
Sam: Remember that thing I found?
Laura: Because you got that down in the fucking Nine Hells, right?
Sam: Yeah. Someone's watching us. For a year.
Taliesin: Oh my god, they're right there.
Laura: That is so crazy.
Marisha: What?
Travis: Yeah, watching you make fucking blondies. All right, this channel's boring.
Taliesin: The blondie channel.
Travis: He's making armor. Ugh.
Liam: (guttural, growly) I want a blondie so bad!
Marisha: I'm going to conjure an air elemental, and then I'm going to go over to Grog and I'm going to give him a big hug and say, for the next hour, no one can keep a hold of you. And I'm going to give him Freedom of Movement.
Travis: What is that?
Taliesin: Target should now spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from non-magical restraints such as manacles or creatures that have grapple.
Marisha: You can't be grappled.
Travis: So I just spend five feet of my movement?
Marisha: You're also unaffected by difficult terrain. And spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
Taliesin: You are parkour.
Marisha: You're parkour.
Travis: I'm Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation.
Marisha: Because I feel like you've been restrained a lot.
Matt: As you finish the conjuration with the staff and slam it into the ground at the edge of the entranceway, you watch as a nearby cloud starts to swirl and descend, and you hear this cracking sound as the planar shift between your plane and the Elemental Plane of Air briefly hiccups open and then summons forth an air elemental that (whoosh) rushes down under your control. It is concentration. Keep that in mind.
Marisha: Yes.
Matt: All righty.
Taliesin: Let's go.
Travis: Do it.
Matt: So. Two brooms of flying, magic carpet, wings.
Laura: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Taliesin: (singing) And a partridge in a pear tree.
Matt: And you are...
Marisha: I know. I'm wondering if I should ahead and go elemental, but I can't cast. Can I get on the carpet? Is there room?
Matt: The carpet's full.
Taliesin: I'll hop on the broom. You hop on the carpet.
Matt: Okay, we can do that. All right, so you guys slowly begin to descend down this heavy, open tunnel.
Laura: This is just the stupidest. We're sticking to the middle.
Marisha: Did you cast Pass Without a Trace?
Matt: Yes. So I would like all you guys to make a stealth check, please.
Travis: Natural 20.
Laura: Oh shit! Flying carpet! Ooh, shit, and add ten, y'all.
Taliesin: 27.
Sam: 21.
Liam: I rolled a two, but it's a 37.
Ashley: That's ridiculous.
Laura: 39.
Liam: Built into the rules, man!
Matt: Yep, reliable rogues, man. That's what rogues are good at.
Marisha: 37.
Ashley: 28!
Travis: 30.
Matt: 30, okay! As you guys all descend, you get about halfway down the tunnel, and you can hear this occasional echo (clicking). And for those of you that have Darkvision, you look off to the side and you see there are these small openings, these tunnels in the sides, and occasionally you see a large insect-like creature skitter out (clicking) and then into another hole. None seem to see or notice your presence. You continue delving deeper and deeper and deeper. Looking up above, you can see the slowly vanishing circle of daylight above you, and as you continue further and further down, those of you with Darkvision, you begin to see a floor begin to approach.
Sam: Don't land?
Laura: Don't land.
Sam: Do we need light?
Travis: No, not yet. I halt the carpet 20 feet off the ground.
Matt: Okay. You halt the carpet.
Laura: And we're whispering. We're whispering, but we're not whispering so that people can hear. We're definitely whispering over--
Ashley: Can we see any little creature in the middle of anything?
Matt: Make a perception check.
Laura: Can I look, too?
Sam: I have some sort of a cloak over my helm, since it emits light always.
Matt: Okay. It doesn't block all the light because it's the Helm of Brilliance. As you guys are being somewhat stealthy going down here, Taryon is still a slight beacon of fire. His helmet just emits a glow at all times.
Travis: Cool. Because insects don't love lights in the dark.
Marisha: I know.
Ashley: 25 for perception.
Laura: 22.
Matt: Okay. You glance about and you can see this opening at the bottom. There's some warping to the earth here. It's one large chamber that's almost peanut-shaped, it pinches in the center and closes around, and there's a small tunnel that leads off and then closes at the end. It appears to be what may have been some sort of mine shaft that has then collapsed on the opposite side, but the center here looks like there's some fallen barrels and chest pieces, and there are pieces of rods and rope and cords strewn about. And there's this ancient stone platform that rises up in the center, and what appears to be some sort of a small recess in the stonework there. It looks like it's the size of a football carved downward.
Sam: I was wrong. It only emits light when there's undead around.
Matt: Oh.
Laura: Is it emitting light? Is it like an orc?
Matt: It is currently not emitting light.
Laura: Should we just nuke it? Should we just nuke that thing?
Travis: The ancient platform? No, don't do that.
Laura: Oh, it was like a coffin. Does it look like a coffin?
Matt: You could probably get closer.
Taliesin: Let's get a little closer.
Laura: A teeny bit.
Matt: Okay. Because you're a ways from it and you have no light down here. Even with your Darkvision, you can make out some details. The closer you get, you see a number of small carvings in what looks like some sort of language that I don't believe you understand.
Taliesin: Celestial?
Matt: You don't see it. It's pitch-black for you, Mr. Human.
Laura: Abyssal? Draconic?
Matt: Nope.
Marisha: Primordial?
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Common.
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: That would be amazing.
Ashley: Dwarvish. Gnomish.
Matt: Nope.
Travis: Giant?
Laura: Yeah, they're human. They can't see shit.
Matt: The humans are sitting there in pitch black, seeing this tiny little bead of light above and just hoping that someone's going to give them some indicator.
Laura: Should we cast some light down here?
Sam: Sure. We said that we had prepared our flashlights before, didn't we?
Taliesin: Oh, we have that low-light version! We have the red-light version of it.
Sam: Yes, we do. I'm going to mark off two of these.
Liam: I can get around very fast. Why don't I go look?
Sam: You want to borrow a flashlight?
Liam: I have a flashlight.
Taliesin: You don't speak Celestial.
Marisha: I can also just cast Daylight, by the by.
Sam: Well, that's what we have going in our flashlights, are Daylight spells.
Taliesin: Except they're lensed and contained.
Matt: It's contained, but it's still a single beam.
Taliesin: A beam of red light.
Matt: So you go ahead and get close on the broom.
Taliesin: And just start to see if I can make out what it is.
Matt: Right. You open up the hood of the light, and it immediately beams this stark red beam down on this portion, and you look at it. It is Celestial.
Taliesin: What does it say?
Matt: It appears to be runes of gestation and protection. It speaks of a seed, a guardian for ages to come: Symphior.
All: Symphior.
Taliesin: It's an incubator. This isn't a coffin. It hatched.
Ashley: So this is the opening of-- this is where it was.
Liam: Is it a guard cherub?
Matt: You notice as this pale white light begins to slowly appear a little ways ahead of you in the other side of the chamber. This light is emanating from some--
Taliesin: I snuff. The second.
Laura: And we back away from the thing.
Matt: You guys begin to drift back on the carpet, and you see this beacon of light hovering maybe ten feet up off the ground, about the same height that you guys were to the platform. And you see there what appears to be a cherub. It's a baby, or an infant, but it appears to be withered and gray, and its arms and legs hang limply, and it has these small, white angel-like wings, but the feathers are tattered and broken in places, and the head's lolled back, and as the glow grows from it, it goes (wheezes, screams) and gives out this heinous scream that echoes throughout the whole hall. You can't help but instinctually grab your ears. I would like you all to make a wisdom saving throw, please.
Laura: Advantage on!
Matt: Which, actually, you are immune to fear, so it does not affect you. However, it shakes the interior and you watch as small stones (thud) hitting the ground around you. You guys, looking up above, you can see that this scream is affecting the structure a little bit. I need you all to roll initiative.
Marisha: Oh, that's good!
Sam: Oh, that sucks.
Laura: Oh shit.
Matt: So we have, up here by the platform.
Liam: I rolled a 20 on the wisdom save we didn't need to make, and threw it away, and thought, "well, I wanted to keep it," and then I rolled again and I got another natural 20.
Marisha: Oh shit.
Sam: Whoa, look at that! There's a map.
Laura: Wow, it's cool-looking! Oh shit, we're right by the baby.
Liam: Where's the baby?
Matt: There it is.
Laura: Oh, that's the baby?
Matt: It's very tiny.
Laura: Oh, it's a mean baby. I feel like it could be saved, because it's--
Liam: When you say saved, do you mean killed?
Laura: I feel bad because it's a baby.
Matt: All right. Initiatives. 25 to 20, anybody?
Liam: 25.
Marisha: Holy shit.
Matt: Who rolled what?
Taliesin: 30.
Matt: Jesus Christ, Percy.
Liam: So what did you roll?
Taliesin: I rolled a 19, and my initiative is 11.
Ashley: Jeez.
Liam: Wow.
Taliesin: I am going to debate hard how dumb I'm about to be.
Liam: The dumbest.
Matt: All right. So 20 to 15.
Ashley: 20.
Marisha: 19.
Ashley: What did you get?
Liam: 25.
Ashley: You got a 25, okay.
Matt: All right. 15 to 10?
Laura: 12.
Matt: Ten to five.
Sam: Oh yeah.
Travis: Eight.
Sam: Six.
Matt: All righty. All right, guys, we're going to keep this coming at everyone fast, because we're going to make this happen. All right, first and foremost, as this creature emerges and you guys are in your respective places, Percival, you're up first.
Taliesin: Where am I?
Matt: You're up here near the top of the platform, where you saw the recess.
Taliesin: Goddamn it! Okay, so I'm far away from that little bugger, aren't I?
Matt: Yeah, it appeared on the opposite side of this double chamber. It's all up from there.
Taliesin: Okay. I'm going to hop off the broom.
Matt: Okay. So you hop off of there.
Taliesin: Actually, no. You're going to move towards it, I assume?
Laura: I'm so far below you in the initiative, though.
Taliesin: Okay, that's fair.
Sam: It's glowing, right, so we can see it even if we don't turn on flashlights and things?
Matt: You can see it, yes, but you cannot see the terrain around you.
Travis: I'm sure we're going to try and talk to it, right?
Sam: Yeah. Maybe it knows my family's name.
Matt: So Percival, what are you doing?
Taliesin: I'm going to hop off the broom, activate my boots and activate my gloves, and start running through that little choke point, and I'm going to get as close to and possibly on the wall of that choke point as humanly possible. The other side of the choke point.
Matt: Oh, this side? You can get about there. You don't quite get to the wall.
Taliesin: Okay. I can get about there?
Matt: You can get further, but currently the creature is out of your view.
Taliesin: That's fine. That's as far as I can get right now. That will be just fine. The gloves are charged, the boots are on, and I'm heading towards the wall.
Matt: Okay. That's your turn?
Taliesin: Yep.
Matt: All right. Vax?
Liam: Okay. Boots on, I'm going to arc over to ten feet away from the baby.
Matt: All right. About there?
Liam: Yeah. Where I am, is it straight up, or am I covered over here?
Matt: It's straight up. Where you see the walls are right now, even this is collapsed about here. In fact, I'd say, to keep it easier, I'll say that's a collapsed entrance there. But this is all a straight-up hole in the ground. It slowly funnels as it gets to the bottom.
Laura: Whoa.
Liam: All right. So action, action, bonus action. I'm going to cast Vow of Enmity on it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: Then I'm going to throw Whisper at it.
Matt: All righty.
Liam: That is a 33 to hit.
Matt: That hits.
Liam: I'm going to cast Divine Smite on it.
Laura: Good job! Kill that celestial baby!
Liam: There's a lot of dice here.
Laura: Get all the bacon!
Liam: This is ten, plus psychic damage is 11. That's not very good. 11 plus Divine Smite is 12, 19, plus sneak attack damage. 19, 21, 26, 28, 29, 34, 36, 38. And there's nothing extra because it's celestial, not a fiend.
Matt: Correct.
Liam: All right. So that was bonus action, action, I'm going to use my action to then just fly away from the fucking thing, a hundred feet away diagonally up into the tunnel where I can still see it, hopefully. I'm hasted.
Matt: Right.
Liam: Movement was to get there. Bonus action for Vow of Enmity. Action to attack, and then my hasted action I can use for dash, hide, disengage.
Matt: Correct. Dash is your full movement, which is--
Liam: 60 normally, 120 feet hasted. I didn't make these rules or these items. (whoosh)
Matt: Cool.
Liam: Diagonally up. I'll fly by my sister, how's that?
Matt: You fly by your sister? Okay. No worries. That ends your turn. All right. Pike, you're up.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope.
Matt: Actually, sorry. Before the end of your turn, it's going to go ahead and use a legendary action to use a terrain shift.
Travis: But it's just a baby!
Laura: Oh no! We're in its lair!
Matt: Yep. As you stab the creature, it (gasps). There's a horrible sucking sound as you dart back. It looks over in your direction. The wings flutter once and it brings its arms up, and as it does and you land next to your sister, you feel the air around you begin to freeze in cold. This energy's just (crackling). You feel ice crystals condense around, and both of you feel the air in your lungs suddenly begin to freeze up. I need both of you guys to make constitution saving throws.
Laura: Thanks for coming right next to me on that one. Goddamn it.
Liam: Natural 20.
Matt: Nice!
Laura: What am I doing, a constitution?
Matt: Constitution saving throw.
Laura: Nine.
Matt: All righty. 19 points of cold damage to you, Vex, and that is nine points of cold damage to you, Vax. And while you manage to pull out of this space of condensed cold, Vax, your sister, however, becomes stunned for one round as your body is frozen and locked in place.
Sam: Do we see any of this happen?
Matt: You watch the air coalesce into this frozen area, and while the broom is still holding you aloft, thankfully, you are standing there in place and the ice falls, clatters, and slams into the ground below you, sounding like the shattering of a hundred pieces of crystal across the stonework. Pike, now it's your turn.
Ashley: Okay. I'm going to cast Beacon of Hope. And for my bonus action, I'm going to pull out a spiritual weapon of a giant big greatsword.
Travis: Yeah!
Laura: A giant baby rattle that's directly in front of it.
Travis: Don't fight, play with this.
Matt: It's a level two spiritual weapon. Where are you putting the spiritual weapon?
Ashley: Right in front of the baby!
Matt: All right. I believe you get to make an attack with it, then, if you do.
Ashley: Yeah.
Matt: All right. So.
Ashley: Oh, but I don't know if I want to hurt the baby. Did you do any damage?
Liam: Yeah.
Matt: Once again, roll for attack on that.
Ashley: Oh, that's not very good.
Matt: So you roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: 13.
Matt: 13. (whoosh) It swings, and the creature flaps out of the way and avoids the blow.
Ashley: Stupid piece of dice crap.
Matt: Are you going to move or stay where you are?
Laura: Oh yeah! I'm resistant to cold, Travis just reminded me! I have cold resistance because of my Vorugal armor.
Matt: You do.
Laura: Does that mean I roll again for--
Matt: No, you take half the damage, but you're still stunned.
Laura: Oh, okay. So that was 17?
Matt: You would take nine damage instead of the 19.
Liam: Nine instead of 18 is what you would've taken for it.
Laura: Okay, so add nine back.
Matt: So do you want to move with your turn?
Ashley: No, I'm going to stay.
Matt: Okay.
Ashley: I'm going to stay. Because we're on the carpet, right? Grog, Percy, and I on the carpet?
Taliesin: I'm not on the carpet.
Ashley: You're not on the carpet anymore? Oh, the three of us. I'm going to stay on the carpet.
Taliesin: You can move the carpet forward, though.
Laura: Did Beacon of Hope get everybody?
Matt: Beacon of Hope. The range on that is 30 feet. 30-foot range gets everybody except for the elemental.
Marisha: That's cool.
Taliesin: What do we get?
Matt: Beacon of Hope, you have advantage on Wisdom saving throws, death saving throws, and you regain the max number of hit points possible from any healing.
Marisha: Sick.
Matt: All righty. That end your turn?
Ashley: Yes.
Laura: Death saving throw is huge. And healing is huge.
Matt: At the end of your turn, the creature goes (raspy breathing) and you watch as the ground right beneath the carpet explodes. It peels back as molten lava suddenly begins to spill up in a column beneath you, splattering up and to the back and over the top of the carpet. I need everybody in this cluster, this ten-foot-by-ten-foot section, to make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: Not good, but maybe I'm lucky. Oh, am I not in that? Where am I?
Taliesin: You're over on the corner.
Sam: I have no idea where I am.
Laura: You're next to the big white thing.
Sam: I am?
Matt: So Grog, Pike, and Keyleth.
Sam: Oh, well then, never mind.
Travis: Danger sense 18.
Matt: Danger sense 18.
Marisha: 17.
Ashley: Natural 20.
Matt: Natural 20 plus, what's your--
Ashley: One! 21!
Matt: Pike's the only one who made it.
Ashley: What?
Matt: Pike, you suffer 21 points of fire damage, halved because of your armor, so you only take ten. Ten points of fire damage.
Ashley: Okay.
Matt: I need you to go ahead and make a concentration check on Beacon of Hope.
Laura: You got this. You got this, Pike.
Matt: Just roll a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Fucking molten lava!
Matt: Keyleth and Grog, you guys both take 42 points of fire damage.
Travis: Oh, it was nice being over 250 for a little while.
Ashley: Fucking fuck.
Matt: The ground below you right now is currently in flames, and you guys have to stick around that space there. The open ground is billowing flame and lava now, and the area around that platform is searing hot. So what did you roll?
Ashley: Five.
Matt: A five with your--
Ashley: Yes.
Matt: Yeah. You lose Beacon of Hope. Sorry.
Laura: What is it? You have to get above half of the damage you took, is that what it is?
Matt: You have to get above half the damage you took or ten, whichever is higher.
Laura: Oh.
Travis: Do we stay on the carpet or are we knocked off?
Matt: You guys can choose to stay on the carpet. You pull out of the way, and now the area is just billowing with lava and flame. Keyleth, it's your turn.
Marisha: Okay. I'm going to take and control my air elemental and send him over.
Matt: All right. You took how much damage? 42?
Marisha: 42.
Matt: Make a concentration check. Constitution saving throw.
Marisha: So I have to get over-- I have advantage on these.
Matt: Yes. You have to get over a 21.
Sam: Over a 21!
Matt: A 21 or over.
Marisha: What's 17 plus four?
Sam: 21.
Matt: 21. You just maintain concentration.
Laura: Good roll!
Marisha: Thank you, Gil! All right. So (boom) I send him over with my staff. It has 90-feet fly speed.
Matt: 90-feet flying speed? Yeah, he gets over there easy. Plops on over.
Marisha: And he's going to go ahead and do a Whirlwind. The creatures in his space have to make a DC 13 strength saving throw.
Matt: Okay. Nope. This is not a very strong creature.
Marisha: That's what I hoped. They take 3d8 plus two bludgeoning damage.
Matt: Go ahead and roll the damage on that, yeah.
Marisha: Oh, that's nasty. 12 plus seven is 19 plus two, so 21. And they are flung up to 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone.
Matt: Random direction, I'll roll for that. Okay. That's going to fling him 20 feet into the five, ten, 15, 20 into the wall right there, and prone.
Marisha: And are knocked prone.
Liam: Stupid baby.
Marisha: Do I still have line of sight?
Matt: To it right now, no. You would have to get off the carpet to go.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm going to get off the carpet and walk over just to where I have line of sight.
Matt: Okay. At the top of your turn, by the way, you suffer eight points of fire damage by the proximity to the flaming platform there.
Marisha: Even though my mantle allows me to ignore the penalties of dangerous weather effects?
Matt: It's not so much a weather effect. It's more that there's a heaping column of molten rock.
Travis: Your old friend, molten lava.
Matt: Eight points of fire damage. And I need you to make another concentration check.
Sam: Oh no, another concentration check!
Marisha: I'm a warcaster, though, man! Because that's eight, so I just have to get over a ten, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Laura: What is this considered, Underdark, or a dungeon?
Marisha: Rolled a 13.
Matt: This is considered subterranean, not Underdark. Cavern. All right, so you've done that. What do you want to do, Keyleth? You're over here.
Marisha: Okay. Can I move over to where I have line of sight?
Matt: Yeah, so you leap over and you get line of sight on him right there.
Marisha: Okay, can I do Blight?
Matt: Sure. What's the DC on that?
Marisha: I think my spell level, so 20.
Matt: And it's a constitution saving throw, I believe?
Marisha: 8d8.
Matt: Six plus ten, so it's a 16.
Marisha: No, fail.
Matt: Yeah. So roll your 8d8 necrotic damage.
Laura: Get it!
Matt: Yeah, no. Even with advantage on the save, it rolled a six and a four.
Marisha: One, two, three, four. Give me two more. One more, and another.
Taliesin: I don't know if I have another.
Marisha: Give me a d8. Okay.
Taliesin: And you reroll ones, right?
Marisha: No, on elementals. Four, five, nine, 14, plus eight is 22, plus four is 26, plus two is 28. 28 Blight damage.
Matt: Nice. As you reach, it's on the ground. It's trying to get back up, and its wings are flapping, and all of a sudden you watch as its gray, withered skin turns dark black on one half of its body and it (screech) shrieks out and gives another scream (hoarse scream) from the ground, and the area quakes again, and you feel the ground shimmy a bit. The ground beneath you, as its last legendary action, begins to give way. Keyleth, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.
Marisha: Fucking lava!
Taliesin: Didn't you move? Wait, no, you moved, didn't you?
Matt: Yeah, this is a different area.
Marisha: That's not bad. 19. No, 18?
Matt: Nope. So as you finish casting this and you hear it scream, you cover your ears, and suddenly the ground moves out beneath you. You watch as the actual floor (whoosh).
Marisha: I turn to everyone behind me and I go, aw, fuck!
Matt: As you watch Keyleth plummet into a pit below. You take eight points of bludgeoning damage and the ground (whoosh) covers over her.
Marisha: It's fine.
Matt: Keyleth vanishes. The ground seems to swallow her up. Keyleth, the entire pit collapses in on you, and you're currently restrained underground, and you cannot breathe.
Marisha: All right.
Taliesin: That's fixable.
Sam: But can you cast things while you can't move?
Matt: I need you to make another concentration check.
Marisha: On my elemental?
Matt: Yes.
Marisha: Yeah, 13 plus my constitution, right?
Matt: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, I'm good.
Matt: Okay. That ends your turn, Keyleth?
Travis: Matt, can you point to where the cherub is?
Matt: I am, because it's his turn. The cherub creature, this Symphior, begins to fly up off the ground and make its way back in this direction, out into the open once more.
Liam: Keeps everyone from getting a good night's sleep.
Laura: He needs a nap.
Ashley: He has a dirty diaper. He's mad.
Liam: It's been a thousand years!
Matt: As it floats upward, it looks over towards where-- let's see, because all it sees is you two. You both are still in the flames right there. It's not worried about the fire at the moment. It sees you, Taryon, and goes (hoarse wheezing) and lifts its hands up. I need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.
Sam: I'm feeling lucky. Natural 20! Plus one.
Matt: That's great. So you only suffer 11 points of piercing damage.
Sam: Hey, that's not bad.
Matt: As you leap out of the way, you watch as the ground suddenly turns into a series of earthlike spikes underneath, and some pierce you and scratch you and you roll out of the way. You barely move off to the side, where now you see this giant, jutting series of spike-like pillars forcing up from the ground. All right, that's going to end that attack, and it's going to use the rest of its movement to move back (whoosh) over to there in the corner. That brings us back to Vex. It's your turn now.
Laura: Yeah, I'm frozen.
Matt: Yeah, so you're stunned, and that's your turn.
Laura: Yay.
Matt: You eventually break the ice off at the end of your turn, and you're breathing heavily and trying to get the feeling back in your skin. That's your go. Grog, you're up.
Travis: What does it take to activate the coin?
Sam: You have to slap it on yourself.
Matt: It's an action.
Travis: Yeah? Just an action?
Matt: Which spell do you have?
Travis: It's the Jump coin, three times my--
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It's touch.
Matt: What's the casting time of Jump?
Sam: It lasts a minute. It's instantaneous. You just touch, right?
Taliesin: No, is it a bonus action?
Matt: So that would be your action to use it on yourself.
Travis: Oh, damn. It's that whole shit, yo. All right. (grunts) I'm going to jump! And I would like to rage as my bonus action. And with my new Jump coin, I would like to jump with my Boots of Feral Leaping. It's three times my horizontal jump speed, which is 20 feet, so 60 feet.
Matt: Okay. You also take seven points of fire damage at the start of your turn, because you're by this flame.
Travis: Oh, got it. Nice, that's fine. And can I jump towards the baby? Actually just to the right of the-- just over here.
Matt: Over to this side there?
Travis: Yeah, right there.
Matt: Okay, yeah. You run (whoosh, thud) land next to it.
Travis: Nice. Do I have any movement left?
Matt: With the run and the jump, you have maybe ten feet.
Travis: Okay. I want to get right up on him.
Matt: Yeah, you're right up on him.
Travis: Never mind. I'm good. Rage, jump, no more action. Titanstone Knuckles? Next round. Okay.
Matt: You have an action, still.
Travis: Oh, I do?
Matt: Well, no, because you said it's a bonus action to do the leap? What's it say on that? Just to do the leap, right? It was the run. You still have an action.
Travis: I want to hit him.
Matt: Go for it.
Travis: Great weapon master, reckless attack.
Matt: Okay!
Travis: That's a 26.
Matt: 26 with the minus five? Yeah, that hits.
Travis: Nice. 12. Where are you? I should have gotten this beforehand. Nice! Plus ten. 37.
Matt: All righty. That's your first strike.
Travis: Oh, I get another one!
Matt: You have extra attack, man!
Travis: 11, 24.
Matt: 24 does not hit. It's a tiny size. It's hard to swing at, and as your axe almost catches it, it (whoosh) out of the way.
Travis: Okay. Good to know. I whiff. That's it. I just have the two.
Matt: Yep, that's your turn. At the end of your turn, because it's reset back to its ground, it's going to go ahead and look to you in front of it and go (hoarse breathing). Make a dexterity check.
Travis: Okay. Saving throw or just dexterity?
Matt: Dexterity saving throw, sorry.
Travis: I get two of those. That's better. 19.
Matt: The ground crumbles beneath you and you suddenly (whoosh) fall below. You are raging. It would've been 12 points of bludgeoning damage, but it becomes six. But you are suddenly buried and restrained underground.
Liam: Got that slick stuff on you? Crisco oil?
Travis: But that's my next turn. That happens on my turn.
Taliesin: Yeah, you burn five feet of movement to get out of it.
Travis: Can I get out of it if I'm buried in soil, though?
Matt: Freedom of Movement. I'll say it doesn't have--
Marisha: That's why I cast it on him, man.
Taliesin: You parkour around the rocks as they try and--
Matt: Well, he's buried in the ground, regardless. That's the effect. He didn't avoid the burying. So I guess you'd just, if you want to use your action to try to escape, you do so.
Laura: You could enlarge, maybe. You can enlarge and come up out of it.
Matt: All right. That ends that go. Taryon, you're up.
Sam: Me? Oh god. All right. I don't have anything I can do. I will click my Boots of Speed, making me faster, and then I will move. Full movement of 60 feet towards him-- or her. We don't know, do we?
Laura: Is it wearing a diaper, or is its dangly bits hanging out?
Liam: Is a peeper hanging out?
Sam: Is it naked?
Matt: You've got a pretty close look, if you wanted to take a moment to inspect.
Liam: It's a boy!
Sam: We're trying to kill this thing, yeah?
Travis: Yeah!
Sam: I guess I'll punch a baby. It's going to miss, though. That's a slippery baby, right?
Matt: At 60 feet of movement, you're not quite within melee range of it.
Sam: No, I was going to use my Ring of the Ram.
Matt: Oh, that'll do.
Sam: But I'm probably not going to hit, because it's got an amazing AC.
Liam: Got any Luck left?
Sam: Yeah, I do.
Taliesin: See what happens.
Liam: Got to do something.
Sam: Is this going to be a long fight? I'll do all three charges of the Ring of the Ram, and punch a baby.
Matt: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack.
Sam: Eight. Not good enough, I'll use Luck. 13 plus nine? 22.
Ashley: Wait! Can I War God's Blessing?
Matt: What's the range on War God's Blessing?
Ashley: Let's see. 30 feet?
Matt: No, he's out of range for that, unfortunately. Sorry!
Liam: I wanted that baby to be punched so bad.
Matt: As you (ring firing), it (whoosh) out of the way and the fist goes by. Slamming into the wall. (crash)
Taliesin: One day, it's going to be epic.
Sam: It worked once.
Matt: It got you a kill. The marid.
Liam: That little baby just Zatoichi-ed out of the way.
Matt: Yeah, so you're just like, (ring firing). No effect. It dodges out of the way. And now you can see its weird, lifeless white eyes turn towards you once more.
Sam: Oh, great.
Matt: That end your turn?
Sam: Yep.
Matt: All righty. Let's see here. It's going to go ahead and use another ability now. As it sees that you're closed in, it glances over, and you watch as suddenly, a bunch of stonework just (rushing noise) up in the center of the area, as now--
Marisha: Oh, fuck. One of these guys. What? A wall?
Matt: A giant stone wall suddenly shoots up above to about 40 feet.
Sam: We got this, guys. Don't worry. Me and Grog got it. Me and buried-Grog and buried-Keyleth, we got this.
Marisha: Wait, you're buried, too?
Sam: No, you are and Grog is.
Marisha: I'm under the wall, right?
Matt: You're underneath right over here. You're on the outskirts of the wall.
Sam: It's just me and the baby right now?
Matt: Yeah, you and the baby, and an air elemental, and a giant sword that's swinging.
Marisha: Yeah, my air elemental is there.
Sam: Oh, great. I'm fine, then.
Matt: But you lose vision entirely, Pike. Just (rushing noise) wall's in front of you. Percy, you're up.
Taliesin: So is the wall hitting the roof?
Matt: No, the wall would have to go way high. It's about 40 feet up.
Taliesin: I'm going to run up to the top of that wall.
Matt: Your movement will not get you to the top. Because you only move 30 feet.
Taliesin: How far will my movement get me?
Matt: It'll get you about there.
Ashley: Parkour!
Travis: Like some unmotivated Spider-Man.
Taliesin: In that case-- oh fuck, I've got nothing I can do.
Matt: I'll put you right there to remind us, but you're almost at the top of the wall at your full movement.
Taliesin: Well, then I will burn my action to dash up.
Matt: Okay. You get to the top of the wall, there, and you can now see it.
Taliesin: And I assume I can get part of the way down the wall as well with my action?
Matt: You can get partway down the wall, yeah.
Taliesin: Yeah, so I just want to start making my way, I'm going Spider-man.
Matt: So you get about, I'll say, there on the opposite side.
Taliesin: That was definitely irritating.
Matt: That's your turn, Percy?
Taliesin: That, and I'm going to cast Hex on that little baby. And he has disadvantage on, let's make it his wisdom checks.
Matt: Okay. All right. At the end of your turn, Percy. Let's see, it's going to go ahead and use--
Taliesin: That's a lot of actions, this creature.
Matt: It's legendary actions. It manipulates the area around it. Because you are currently standing on the side there. No, you know what, it's going to hold off. It's not going to do anything. Vax, you're up.
Taliesin: I haven't actually technically attacked it.
Liam: I know what I want to do. You tell me what I can do. First thing I want to do is cast Bless on-- I grab Vex, cast Bless on us and Pike, I have a range of 30 feet on it.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Is that bonus? No, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I fly straight at Pike and I'm going to lift her up.
Matt: Okay, you immediately take eight points of fire damage by getting close to the flames to grab her. It's like (fire noises).
Liam: Sure. And then is it an action to grab and an action to lift and carry over?
Matt: I'd say it would be an action to grab her enough, and you're going to move at half speed with her.
Liam: Which is still a ton at this point.
Matt: Yeah.
Liam: And that's all I need is the action to grab her and movement to go over?
Matt: Action, and your movement there was about there, I'd say you'll get your action and your movement will get you to up above the wall.
Liam: Okay. Action and movement will. All right, then I will leave her on top of the wall, and I will use my bonus action to fly within range of baby, and I should have one action left, yeah? Action, action, bonus action, hasted.
Matt: Right. Hold on, no. You used an action to pick up Pike. You brought her up there, you moved, you have another action and a bonus action. You have an action and a bonus action. But the extra action that you have is from your haste, which means it can be used for either a melee attack or ranged.
Liam: Great. So the bonus action I will use to dash towards baby. And my final, hasted attack action, I will stay 30 feet away from the baby, though, in the air, and I will throw Whisper with my last, hasted action.
Matt: Okay. There you go. Put you down there.
Liam: And that's a 25, which hits, yeah?
Matt: That hits. That just hits, yeah.
Liam: One, and can I dump Smite into this?
Matt: If you'd like to, yeah.
Liam: I would like to. There's nine plus psychic damage is 16 plus-- 20, 26, and here comes the sneak attack damage, 26, 27, 29, 30, 33, 37, 43, 47.
Matt: 47? Nice. As you swipe down to (whoosh) fling Whisper out, it slams right into the chest of the creature and it impales it off the back side and there's the burst of divine energy inside, but you see the divine energy matches its own, and what looks like a blow that would've killed the creature, it's like, (raspy inhale). Turns back towards you, and gives another scream as the dagger returns to you. End of your turn?
Liam: That's the end of my turn.
Matt: All right, at the end of your turn, it's going to use its last legendary action. It's going to use another cold snap. You feel the air around you, familiar, (whoosh) condense, and the ice cling to you. The air in your lungs freezes solid, it seems. Go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.
Liam: Going to use another Luck. 25.
Matt: 25 will succeed, all right. So you shrug off the stunned effect, but you do still suffer the halved damage. 13 points of cold damage. All righty. Pike, you're up. Top of your turn, you suffer no damage, because you got out of the fire. You're at the top of the wall now.
Ashley: All right. If I climb down there, it's an athletics thing?
Matt: Yes.
Ashley: Oh, okay. I'll climb down.
Matt: Roll an athletics check. It's 40 feet down. So that's going to be a long climb.
Ashley: Okay.
Laura: Oh no.
Travis: Oh, is it really? Is it fucking really?
Matt: It's a natural one?
Ashley: Yeah.
Travis: Who put her on the top of a 40 foot wall?
Laura: Just picked her up and dropped her there.
Ashley: Wait!
Liam: She can see and cast spells!
Ashley: I have Feather Fall with my shield.
Matt: You do. So you use your reaction to cast Feather Fall on yourself as you stumble off the side, and as you plummet about 20 or so of the 40 feet (whoosh, soft impact) and you land unscathed on the ground.
Ashley: Okay. Is that just my action?
Matt: That's your reaction to do that. With the shield.
Ashley: Okay. How close am I to the baby? Can I get to the baby?
Matt: Not physically. It's over here and you're at the base of the wall.
Liam: It's like 50 feet.
Ashley: All right.
Matt: You can get within range to it.
Ashley: So you know what? I'm going to (sings) Guiding Bolt the baby!
Matt: Okay, what level?
Ashley: Let's do five. 5th-level.
Matt: Oh, shit, okay. Go ahead and roll for an attack on that. Wait, is Guiding Bolt an attack? No, is it a saving throw? I think it's a saving throw, isn't it? I always forget that. No, it's a ranged spell attack, so you have to roll to hit it. Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier.
Ashley: It's not enough I don't think. 19? I will use Guided Strike.
Matt: Because you can do that! Guided Strike, you get to add that to your own attack?
Ashley: Yep.
Travis: Channel Divinity.
Matt: (laughs) Still checking it. Guided Strike. Yeah, plus ten to the roll. That'll do it. 29, boom. Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Ashley: How many sixes? Let's see.
Matt: Well it's four levels above that, so it's 8d6 radiant damage.
Ashley: I'll get five, six, seven, eight. Okay, so we've got six, 12. Help me out here, guys. 18. Oh, wow.
Laura: You rolled a lot of sixes!
Ashley: Whoa!
Travis: She rolled six sixes.
Matt: Six sixes?
Marisha: What do you mean?
Liam: She rolled a ton of sixes.
Ashley: 42.
Matt: 42 points?
Travis: I'm looking at them.
Laura: They're all sixes.
Ashley: We choose to kill this celestial baby not because it is easy, but because it is hard!
Matt: So as you land gently on the ground after plummeting head over heels. (thuds, fire blast) Holding your holy symbol before you, you watch as this beam of condensed divine energy rockets across, and this tiny, floating, withered planar baby (fire blast) gets blasted. You watch as the wings get pushed back. It's holding itself in place, but you see the dark shadow outline as the energy is blasting through it. As it hits, its wings recoil, and it's still floating there, but you can see this sparkly outline of divine energy, because the next attack on it has advantage.
Ashley: Do I still have a bonus action?
Matt: You do. Your sword's still up.
Ashley: I'll use the spiritual weapon.
Matt: Spiritual weapon, you can move 20 feet as a bonus action. It moves up and takes a swipe. Go ahead and roll an attack.
Ashley: Oh crap, my boots are stuck together. How is this happening? Okay. Yeah, the hook on the top there.
Laura: That's how she fell off the wall.
Ashley: Ooh. That's a 29.
Matt: 29 hits! Yeah, so go ahead and roll the damage for the spiritual weapon, which is 1d8 plus five, I think, for you. Whatever your wisdom modifier is.
Ashley: Sorry, guys. I don't know what I'm doing. Oh, that's not a lot. Seven.
Matt: Seven points of damage. It all helps. All righty. Keyleth, you're up.
Marisha: I'm underground, right?
Matt: You're underground, you are restrained, you are blind. You cannot see anything.
Marisha: (growls) I'm going to go earth elemental.
Matt: Okay!
Taliesin: I'm amazed he didn't already have it out of the bag.
Matt: And with that ability, you get an earthglide, and this is a non-issue for you. All righty, Keyleth. So you are an earth elemental.
Travis: Damn!
Marisha: Do I have enough movement to earthglide to them?
Matt: What's your speed?
Marisha: I think 60, earthglide?
Matt: 60, earthglide? Yeah, totally. You're moving into melee with the baby?
Marisha: Okay, can I come up from underground, grab them, and then beat them into the ground?
Matt: Sure. Go ahead and roll a slam attack.
Taliesin: Puny god!
Matt: Make two slam attacks, so roll twice. It's plus eight to attack each time.
Marisha: That's cocked. Natural 20 on that one, and a four on a second one, which is 12.
Matt: Yeah, that misses. MARISHA; Okay, but that one is a natural 20.
Matt: As you reach up out of the ground from underneath, (impact noise) your fingers clasp around the celestial baby and (whack) slam it into the ground as hard as you can. Go ahead and roll damage on that. 2d8 plus five, so roll the 2d8.
Marisha: And then you double the 2d8.
Matt: You double whatever you rol for the 2d8 and then add plus five. Crit that baby. It's our next t-shirt: Crit that baby!
Marisha: Six doubled, which is 12, plus five doubled, which is ten, so that's 22.
Matt: The bonus isn't doubled. Just the dice.
Marisha: I know. Just the dice is 22, plus five. So 27.
Matt: That's great. 27 points of damage. (wham) Slamming onto the ground. As your hand retracts up, you can see the wings are-- as it starts to fly up, it (gasps).
Marisha: And I just want to hold onto it and be like, yo! Yo, air elemental! And then let my air elemental come over and do its thing. Double slam attack.
Matt: Go for it.
Marisha: Slam attack. No, I'm going to do a multi attack. Two slam attacks. So 2d8 plus eight, once again. That's an 18 and a 17. Plus eight.
Matt: 18 and 17 plus eight?
Marisha: Yeah, so 26 and 25.
Matt: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Marisha: Which is 3d8 plus two. So the first one, oh! Six, seven, eight, plus seven, which is 15. For the first one, 15 plus two. 17. And then the second one is eight, plus two fives, which is 18 plus two, so 20.
Matt: Nice.
Taliesin: And he gets flung in a random direction?
Matt: No, this was just hitting it. (impacts) All righty. That's the end of your turn? All right. As it comes back to the entity's turn, it's looking really, really rough. And as part of that, it's going to reach into itself. Its hands push into its torso, and as it screams, (raspy scream) it gives out this horrible scream as it tears some of its chest open, and from the inside, where you imagine it would be a ribcage, it's this impossibly bright light that echoes out in a shockwave, affecting everybody except for Vex, actually. I need everybody else to make a constitution saving throw.
Taliesin: All of us?
Matt: Yes.
Sam: Oh boy. That don't look good.
Taliesin: We don't have advantage on this, do we?
Matt: Nope!
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a Resolve.
Marisha: Constitution  that's part of my physical stats as being an elemental, correct? It's con, strength, and dex. Never mind. Yeah.
Matt: So?
Sam: 22.
Matt: 22. That succeeds.
Taliesin: 17.
Marisha: 15.
Liam: 24.
Matt: That succeeds. Pike?
Ashley: 11.
Matt: Okay.
Travis: 25.
Matt: Succeeds. Everyone who succeeds, you suffer 48 points of radiant damage.
Sam: Radiant damage?
Matt: Yes.
Liam: 48 on a success. Whoa.
Matt: If you failed, you took 96 points of radiant damage.
Taliesin: Wait, that's magical. I have advantage. The cloak wouldn't--
Matt: The cloak doesn't say a spell effect?
Taliesin: Against spells and other magical effects.
Matt: Technically, because it's not a leveled spell, it's just a radiant blast, it would not affect it.
Taliesin: It wouldn't have given me advantage on that save?
Matt: No, it wouldn't.
Ashley: 96, you said?
Matt: 96 points of radiant damage. So Keyleth, I need you-- your elemental has gone berserk.
Marisha: There's no way.
Matt: Aside of rolling a 20. Go for it. Just try.
Marisha: Unless I roll a nat 20? They just do their own thing if you fail.
Travis: What do you got to roll, a 20? Percy, bless that shit.
Matt: Even so, I'm letting you have this opportunity.
Marisha: I rolled a 19.
Matt: Nope. So as the Conjure Elemental spell fails, the control of your elemental shifts, and now it's aggressively turning its attention towards you and the rest of your party.
Marisha: Can I not fade it after this? Oh, I can drop concentration on it and then it will go away, right?
Matt: No. That's not how this works.
Travis: Did you just put--
Liam: A new enemy on the map.
Sam: A new opponent enters.
Marisha: To be fair, didn't it also get affected by the blast?
Matt: Yeah, actually. Roll a constitution saving throw for the air elemental. It's a plus two.
Marisha: I rolled a 13, plus two, so 15.
Matt: The air elemental is actually destroyed. To your advantage, strangely.
Marisha: It only has 90 hit points, so it's fine, guys! It's fine.
Matt: All right, so the entity looks like it's barely hanging on, and you see parts of its internal body falling out from where it tore its chest open. It's going to use a bonus action to Misty Step out of this vicinity over to here. It's going to use its movement to fly high up, almost trying to escape the cavern now. It's up in that region right there. We'll say, here. On top of this. Turn that away.
Laura: Oh, look how teeny! I can finally see it.
Ashley: Above a fountain.
Liam: It's a faerie dragon.
Laura: It's so teeny.
Matt: All righty. Vex, you're up.
Laura: I guess I'll fly up so I can see over the wall. I have no idea what's going on.
Matt: You fly up and you see everyone below is wrecked, the ground is charred with some sort of a radiant blast. You watched it flash over the wall itself, like a small, rapid recreation of the intro of Akira. (boom) This big, arcing ball of white energy.
Laura: Wow. Can I Hunter's Mark the baby?
Matt: Sure.
Laura: And then I'm going to try to shoot the baby with my Blazing Bowstring. That would be a 30. And I'm going to make it a bramble shot.
Matt: Okay.
Liam: Ball of vines in the air.
Laura: DC of 17.
Matt: Strength?
Laura: Yeah.
Matt: I actually rolled a natural 17.
Laura: Motherfucker. Okay, well.
Matt: But it still takes the damage.
Laura: Still 4d8 extra. Well. 17, plus five is 22, plus eight is 30, plus two is 32, plus 1d6 lightning damage... 35, plus 1d6 for Hunter's Mark is 40.
Matt: 40, nice! So as it hits, you watch as the brambles try and wrap around it, but it actually flies free.
Laura: Oh wait! Plus the blazing bowstring, another two fire damage.
Matt: 42 total. You can see more of it's just falling out of its small, decomposing torso, and it's trying to fly upward now, towards the light. It's on the edge.
Laura: I want to try to do the same thing again.
Matt: Okay, go for it.
Laura: With a Blazing Bowstring again. 28.
Matt: 28 hits. Roll damage.
Laura: Okay, bramble shot again, because I get two, motherfucker! That's ten for my Blazing Bowstring. Oh, Jesus H. Macy. 19, plus five is 24, plus eight is 32, 36. Oh my god, 34. 38, plus ten is 48.
Matt: How do you want to do this? (cheering)
Travis: Frozen no more! Freeze me at your peril!
Laura: Be free, little angel baby. We shall feast tonight! That's so gross. And I just shoot the baby.
Matt: All right. As you pull back as it's fluttering up, you take aim and release, and as the arrow strikes it, you can see, the same way the dagger hit the baby, it hits it, and throws it, the sheer force of the arrow against the wall, and pins it there like it's stapled to the rock. As it reaches over to try and pull the arrow out, and it begins to, suddenly the arrow (whoosh) breaks into a bunch of bramble vines that begin to wrap around it, and you watch as the tiny baby arm and wing try and reach out (choking) as it constricts and twists and slowly constrains it until you see it (crack) pop and go limp on the inside of the vines. And as the vines unfurl, what was physically there is slowly dissipating into a glitter-like powder. The body dissipating and falling apart.
Laura: I mean, it was an evil baby, right?
Travis: Yeah, nobody likes glitter.
Marisha: Yeah, glitter gets everywhere.
Laura: Should we get out of here?
Travis: (muffled) I don't mean to be rude!
Marisha: I run over to Grog. I'm still an elemental, yeah? I am still an elemental. Where is he?
Matt: You don't know, actually.
Sam: I saw it. I'll point down.
Marisha: You point. I earthglide and I find him.
Matt: Okay.
Marisha: And I can do double damage to structures. Can I beat him out?
Matt: I'd say you could probably, over time, yeah. You have enough constitution to be fine.
Marisha: I don't want to kill him by suffocating.
Matt: No, he's fine. He can hold his breath for six minutes. He's got a really high constitution, so you're fine. You slowly pummel the rock out from his way and pull Grog out from the interior of the stone floor.
Taliesin: Yeah, we should head out and bug bomb the place.
Travis: Don't we need proof?
Taliesin: Grab the body. Let's go.
Sam: There's no body!
Marisha: I go over to the glitter and I get some of my potion bottles from my alchemy to-- Oh, I'm actually good at this. I try and harvest some, sweep some glitter.
Matt: Okay. So you gather some glitter in.
Taliesin: Really quick, just look around, is there anything of value to grab before we run?
Matt: Make an investigation check.
Sam: I'll look, too.
Laura: While she's doing that, can I just look over the ground and see if there's any platinum deposits?
Sam: We could do a quick mining.
Matt: I mean, there are a number of visible edges of veins.
Liam: Is there 230,000 gold worth?
Sam: Probably. We could stay here for a couple months.
Matt: In this whole mine, there's a lot of platinum, but you have to mine it. And as you guys are having this moment, you begin to hear the loud sound of hundreds of large insect-like creatures climbing their way down the walls.
Laura: Oh god. Get to the middle and get in the air.
Marisha: Okay, so I get everybody in the middle. Is everyone ready?
Travis: I need help.
Taliesin: We pulled you out.
Marisha: What do you mean, you need help?
Travis: I'm on the other side of the 40-foot wall from the carpet.
Marisha: I go (boom) and I pull Grog through.
Laura: No, the carpet. We just got to get the carpet. I can go down and grab the carpet.
Marisha: Oh, the carpet. I take a few minutes as my earth elemental self to beast through...
Laura: We don't have a few minutes.
Marisha: I can do double damage to structures.
Laura: You don't have to do that. I can go get the carpet. I'm right there.
Marisha: Oh, okay. Go get the carpet.
Matt: Okay. So you rush over and grab the carpet. And you guys begin to make your way back up through.
Laura: Are we bamfing out or are we flying up?
Taliesin: I think we're flying up and if we see anything we'll just take shots at anything that's rolling around, if anything is visible. Let's just do damage on our way out.
Marisha: Oh, we're doing damage as we fly out.
Liam: Or we could Tree Stride out?
Taliesin: We can't Tree Stride. There's no trees.
Laura: Or we can Plane Shift.
Matt: There is a small tree growing out of the side of the wall from where you killed the creature, but it's not large enough for that spell.
Laura: But still really cool!
Matt: Yeah, it grows and twists out, like a bonsai curves upward.
Laura: I hope that it slowly becomes a forest underground.
Travis: They're going to chop it down as they mine the platinum.
Matt: All right, so you guys are coasting up through the shaft?
Marisha: Oh, are we just riding up?
Travis: Straight up.
Marisha: Broom and carpet? Broom and carpet.
Matt: Okay. You guys begin heading up through the center column of this opening. As you're moving up, are you staying in the darkness?
Laura: Can you Daylight or something, like up and out?
Marisha: I can. Do we need to?
Taliesin: You know, at this point, it might be.
Marisha: On the top of my spire I cast Daylight.
Matt: Okay. So (boom) this light now emerges from this area, and as you can see now through this cavern around you, there's about a dozen or so of these large ankheg creatures, about every 30 feet or so, 40 feet up. You're in the center of-- you look up and you can see easily the hundred that you saw earlier have all been drawn to the surface by the screams of this creature. And as you begin rocketing up with this Daylight spell, you watch as some of them start hanging upward in your direction. You start hearing this sound, (hiss).
Marisha: Are they attracted to the Daylight?
Matt: They're apparently attracted to your presence. It is a line shot. I'm going to go ahead and have, let's see here. Percy and Vex, I need you guys to both make a constitution saving throw.
Travis: Oh shit. Oh god, we did not-- pretty sure you said that last time, before you turned into Chef Boyardee.
Matt: Sorry, sorry, not constitution. Dexterity, my apologies.
Laura: Dexterity saving throw? That is so much better.
Taliesin: Should I reroll? Yeah, I'll reroll.
Laura: Should you reroll?
Matt: Yeah, roll again; it's fine.
Laura: 27.
Taliesin: 18.
Matt: Yeah, you both make it. So you both suffer eight points of acid damage.
Taliesin: I want to start taking shots as high up as I can see, I want to start taking shots at these things.
Laura: Yeah, I'll do the same thing.
Matt: There are over a hundred. And they take more than a few shots to go. We'll say you start picking them off, a few as you go, but you watch them fall past you. There's just such a mass number of them. As you guys get up another 40 or so feet, (spray sound) again. From three different ones. All right, I need Taryon, Percival, and Vex again to make dexterity saving throws.
Sam: Natural 20!
Matt: Nice!
Travis: Nice!
Taliesin: I'll live with that. 17.
Matt: Okay.
Laura: 23.
Matt: Okay, six points of acid damage to the three of you.
Sam: Halved to three for me.
Matt: You make your way up even further. You're about halfway up this tunnel at this point and now you're getting to the heavy cluster of these creatures. At this point, a large cluster of them begin to spray all across. I need all of you guys to make two dexterity saving throws. Anybody get lower than a 13?
Taliesin: Nope.
Ashley: I did.
Travis: I did.
Matt: For one?
Travis: For the second one.
Marisha: Lower than a 13?
Matt: Yeah. That would be all of you except for Pike and Grog take a total of 14 points of acid damage. Both of you guys, for the purposes of this, take 21 points of acid damage.
Sam: You okay there, Pikey-pants?
Ashley: Yeah, I'm fine!
Travis: I'm okay.
Matt: As you're shooting and you hear the gunfire (gunshots) going off, you fire the arrows. More and more of these ankhegs are falling and crumbling off. You hear the (screeching) as they streak past you, plummeting into the darkness below. Even more so, throwing streams out. However, their numbers are starting to thin because you've gone past the thick part of it. Vax, Pike, and Grog. The three of you guys roll dexterity saving throws, please.
Travis: 12.
Liam: 19.
Ashley: 18.
Travis: 12.
Matt: All right. Six points of acid damage, six points of acid damage, 12 points of acid damage.
Laura: How much further do we have to go up?!
Matt: You guys, with the brooms and the carpet, it's not super fast. Putting up there again. You get about three-quarters of the way up.
Sam: What is Pike riding on?
Matt: She's on the carpet.
Ashley: I'm on the carpet. I'm okay.
Laura: You should heal yourself!
Ashley: I know.
Marisha: Can I do a Wind Wall to protect us from around us?
Matt: Wind Wall is stationary. It might help with one round of the spray.
Marisha: Are we doing one more round?
Matt: You'll find out. You don't know.
Marisha: If we are, I will prep my Wind Wall spell to encompass us for one more round.
Matt: Okay. As you guys are heading upward, now you're about three-quarters of the way out. The numbers are thinning a little bit. They start spraying once more. You go ahead and create a Wind Wall that you've been preparing. As you watch, these jets of extremely acidic burning liquid shoot toward you, suddenly a column of wind gets conjured upward from the darkness and deflects the spray into a mist that is thrown back against the wall harmlessly. You're almost to the exit, and you see a handful more towards the very top of this cavern. Keyleth, Percy, and Pike. Make a dexterity saving throw, if you can.
Sam: Pikey.
Marisha: I'm good. 21.
Taliesin: I'm going to burn a reroll. It's the end of my resolves!
Ashley: Oh! Natural 20.
Taliesin: Ten.
Matt: Okay, so eight points of acid damage. 16. Keyleth?
Marisha: 21.
Matt: All right. That's eight points of acid damage. You took the--
Ashley: Eight.
Matt: The eight, yeah. As you guys just crest out of the top of the dark column below, you can watch as the creatures are starting to skitter out from the edges, but you are far above and a few of them are spraying, but you're above the range and it's coasting over and disappearing below. You've now emerged into the night sky, the moonlight above you. You're all fairly beaten.
Taliesin: Is there anything we can throw down there to really piss them off?
Sam: I'll drop a bead of Firewall.
Marisha: Yeah, and I can drop a Fireball on there.
Sam: I'm sorry, a Wall of Fire.
Matt: You're going to throw a Wall of Fire on the edge of it?
Sam: Yeah.
Marisha: Yeah, and I'll throw a Fireball. Burn the place down. Extermination.
Taliesin: Bug bomb.
Travis: I spit in the hole.
Ashley: I was going to see if I could put a Blade Barrier on top of the hole, so once the fire's in there, they can't get out.
Matt: What's the radius on Blade Barrier?
Ashley: 90 feet.
Matt: Okay, we'll say as you come out the top, you throw down the Blade Barrier-- what's the radius of it, though?
Ashley: I don't think it says.
Matt: I'll pull it up real fast.
Ashley: Oh, it does say.
Laura: 60 feet in diameter. No! You can make a straight wall of 100 feet or 60 feet in diameter.
Ashley: Yeah, ringed wall up to 60 feet.
Matt: Okay, so you can make a wall around the one side of it. Not the whole thing.
Sam: Wall of Fire around the other?
Matt: You don't get to get the whole radius, but between the Wall of Fire and the bladed wall, you blast the opening there. You coast away, watching and hearing as dozens of ankhegs that are climbing up to the top begin to (screeching). Eventually, they all begin to burrow back into the rock and stone and vanish. The ones on the surface begin to burrow below. And a calm stillness comes over the exterior of the mines. As you all coast up, hundreds of feet in the air over the forest, licking your wounds. So you removed the glitter and you removed--
Laura: The little coffin.
Matt: The little stone placard. You had to wedge it out, but you got it up there.
Laura: Okay.
Matt: And that's where we'll call it for the night.
Travis: Nice!
Marisha: That was awesome!
Taliesin: I'm at 57 hit points. Yay.
Travis: Add 100 to that and that's somewhere Grog.
Taliesin: Where were you at? I feared for you, man.
Ashley: 11.
Laura: Oh my god!
Travis: That cherub was a bitch.
Matt: Aw man. That was also created by the chat.
Travis: Was it?!
Laura: The baby was created by the chat?!
Travis: Why you do this to us, chat?
Taliesin: Why you make us kill a baby? That was great.
Laura: That was a really cool villain.
Matt: That was a tiny celestial.
Liam: Like beating up a Kewpie doll.
Matt: Was the prospect of doing something that attacks via the terrain instead of--
Ashley: Was he an evil baby?
Laura: Yeah, was it evil? Or could we have saved it?
Matt: The actual title for it is Symphior the Withered Planetar. It was essentially a celestial seed that was placed to eventually emerge as a guardian in a future time, almost a Ragnarok-type circumstance. But the land around it became corrupted as it gestated or was held in stasis, and then was awoken prematurely. And as such, became this horrible monstrous version of what it was supposed to be. It was neutral, but it was dangerous. It seemed pretty far gone. Thank you guys so much. We'll be back next week with the battle royale. That'll be fun.
Travis: Everybody kill Keyleth.
Laura: Yeah. Go for Keyleth to begin with. Try to kill her.
Marisha: I am going to be looking at all of my spells.
Taliesin: These two have to be the first to go down.
Marisha: What? Why?
Taliesin: Because loot drop.
Travis: Yeah, we've got to get Hunger Games with this shit. Defend the cornucopia of loot!
Marisha: I'm going for the machete!
Sam: But Vex, you're my best friend!
Laura: No, you're my best friend. I won't kill you.
Sam: Okay! Like, within five minutes.
Liam: This one shoved my face into lava at the end of the last battle royale.
Marisha: I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: It was pretty good.
Marisha: Then Pike did it to me immediately the next round. I love you! (sizzling)
Matt: Yeah, it was pretty slick. Exactly.
Marisha: Yes, it was.
Laura: Tight.
Matt: Awesome. Thank you so much for watching. We'll be back next week, Thursday, with our battle royale. Hope you have a wonderful night and weekend. And is it Thursday yet? Good night! [music]
